Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shapped three and three quarters inch long offers some protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. There is nothing more irritating than reviewing your images to find dust spots or other flaws. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing or replacing an expensive L lens. This hood is manufactured for the Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS EF lens and normally comes included with the lens when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. Fortunately Canon provides a storage case with the lens that can be used in addition to your camera bag. While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. PROS: Improves contrast and image quality Offers limited protection to the lens CONS: Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the len 
this backpack was very uncomfortable. the inserts are stiff. it doesn't represent canon quality (I hope) 
I'm really pleased with this bag, it holds all my gear with room to spare. There are enough adjustable straps to fine tune the bag to your comfort level. It stays nice and tight against my back and doesn't feel like a burden at all. This is a great value compared to some of the other options. The only drawback to this bag is that there isn't a convenient way of grabbing your camera without taking the bag off and opening it up. Other than that, no faults 
I like the bag. Pleanty of pockets and pouches for all my little small accessories. Just wish it were a little better suited for 2 cameras like I have. But, everything fits...comfortable to haul around all day. Nice pads and straps to secure it to my back. Well padded for the equipment. I'd highly recommend it to anybody 
I needed a camera bag with greater portability, comfort, and security for athletic venues as well as being in the outdoors (i.e. mountains, valleys, trails, etc.) This bag delivered. I can fit my two primary lenses, a telephoto, an external flash, a colapsing tripod and my camera with room to spare. I can even attach my monopod to the side if needed. I like pockets so the extra internal zipper pockets plus the exterior side and front pockets are great for tucking away all of the extras too; like lense cleaning suplies, batteries, and memory cards. The backing and shoulder straps are nicely padded so it wears comfortably as well. When I purchased the backpack I planned to only use it for more "active outings" but have since found myself using it in place of my original camera bag 
My husband and I recently bought this bag to take on a trip to Mexico. It was perfect, fit our video camera, small digital camera, Canon Digital Elph, 2 lenses and all the chargers and accessories we needed for the trip. Plus, the tripod!! Also my husband used it for his carry on bag which was helpful given how tight airport security can be these days. I totally recommend this bag to someone who travels with several different pieces of photographic equipment 
I humped this thing around DC last week for 7 hours, and not a worry to mention. Well balanced, I had it full of a camera, 4 lenses, flash and miscellany. I cut all the extra straps off, and just have the shoulder harness left. And it looks good too. Of course, it's a great advertisement for thieves so never let it out of your grip. 
this item is great.... i love it...i have my 35 mm and digital camera in it along with everything else i need.. 
This item was a perfect fit for my Rebel XT. Well padded, lots of compartments to accommodate my accessories in one location. Awesome product to protect my priced possession. Highly recommended for digital SLR owners 
This monopod is very sturdy and easy to set up. I was looking for a monopod that was capable of handling the weight of my large Canon lens (over 3 lbs), and this one does the job very well. I mainly use it for taking soccer pictures, and so far, I'm very pleased. I highly recomend it 
This is a very good product, the price is cheap, come with the bag which is a plus, if you are looking for a cheap but sturdy monpod, this is the right one, highly recommanded 
Sure, this isn't a pro mono pod and it doesn't have a mobile head but for the money it's great. Easily holds my Olympus E1 with 50-200mm lens. Great as a walking stick as well. Stores tight and light. Highly recommend this product. I may just get a back up 
I use this monopod for my pentax optio w20 camera and for a panasonic video camera. I use it when camping and it doubles as a sturdy walking stick. When I'm out in the wilds people think it's a walking stick until they see my small camera perched on top of it. It has really improved my ability to stay steady and blur free with my new pentax which has no optical viewfinder. I like the quick adjustment legs as opposed to screw type. I've also used this tripod to stick my video camera out of my sunroof to cruise through New England to catch the Autumnal leaves while driving which has given some interesting results. I plan to do the same thing on Rt 1 to film the big sur highway. The only thing I need to get is a ball head to adjust the angle of the camera. For the price this was a steal and a hearty deal 
The Optika MP100 Pro Photo Monopod is surprisingly sturdy, functional and well-made. It is supplied with a reasonably decent quality zippered nylon case with carrying strap. No, it is not "professional grade", but it is something every amateur photographer can use for weekend shooting. I've used it both with digital still and camcorder, where it offers respectable improvement in long-distance shots (versus trying to hold the camera still, or propping it up on the roof of the car, a not-nearby-enough fence post, and so on.) Certainly a LOT handier than the old tripod! I bought two, keeping them ready-for-action in the trunk of my cars. Highly recommended 
Good quality, particularly for the amazing price. Sturdy, well-made, and even the case is nice. Pops open in a second, collapses just as easily. Keep in mind that fully collapsed it's wider than a standard backpack, so if you lash it under a backpack it will be awkward. But the strap on the carrying case makes it easy to loop the monopod and carry it vertically 
The MP100 has served us well since getting it 2 months ago. Like other reviewers, I wasn't expected a whole lot after being disappointed by a $40 monopod made for those well under 6 feet tall. Quite stable, usable as a walking stick, easier to reset height than competition under $50 with twist-lock legs. This monopod definitely exceeded my expectations! Seems to be a niche here for a higher priced version with a pan/tilt head, but I had a 30yr old Leica table top tripod pan/tilt head and the combination works great! On balance, can't be beat even if all you order is the MP100 and pay $6 or so s/h! For use at the beach or where dirt and grit is in the air, you'll want to wipe down the legs before collapsing (cloth used for gun storage work great) or you may have grit in the legs and scratching the MP100 legs in subsequent use. 
Not knowing fully what I was getting into, on a whim I purchased this monopod hoping that is was a half-way decent product, I mean-it was so cheap. I was pleasantly surprised to find how sturdy the unit was and that what I had was a very high quality monopod. This was my second monopod and so I had another to compare it with (the other was bought on an auction website). In comparison the Opteka was a far better monopod in height and robust thickness and I use it exclusively on my miniDV shoots 
This is my second "L" lens the other being 70-200L f4 and both are exceptional. If you are looking for professional results you will need good equipment used within it's limits. 
This is my favorite lens. I could not carry the heavier long range teles, and it was a hard decision for me. In the end, I chose this because it was lighter than the zooms. Having previouly used the 75-300 IS zoom, I was leary of getting another 300mm prime, because I may miss the 70-300 range of shooting. But the clarity and colors are so true for this 300 prime, I don't look back. Easy to handle, not so bulky. Fast, impressive photos. Even when I add a 1.4 teleconverter shooting in the 500mm range on my 20D. I use the f4 alot, no problem, great clarity. Awesome lens for the price 
I got this lens for shooting architecture from a distance--an unsual application. I've also found myself using it to shoot kids soccer games. It's super sharp and very fast focusing. I haven't done formal tests at all apertures, but images appear vivid and contrasty at a range of settings. Online reviews rank this lens very highly and my own experience supports those findings. The Image Stabilization seems to work very well, although be sure to turn it off if you're using a tripod--I've found that it can reduce image quality if you forget to turn it off in that application. For shots where you'll be standing around a lot with the lens to your eye, ready for a shot, it gets kind of heavy to carry. If you're shooting sports, you might want to consider a monopod. For other applications, its weight is low enough not to be too big of a problem. It comes with a canvas-like case that includes a loop you can use to attach it to your belt. I've found this works pretty well out in the field, particularly when combined with a photo-vest. The case also can be carried with a neck strap, but this gets in the way of your camera strap and is also thin, so it kind of cuts into your shoulder. As I write this, the Amazon site has a link for 58mm filters for this lens. It takes 77mm filters 
I am THRILLED with this lens's capabilities and the pictures it does. I test shot a corner of a window to determine if it would be good for my insect shots that I like so well. I bought this add-on converter and am thrilled to have added this and the 50mm lens of these necessary items for my set-up. I like nature photography the best and like to use my off summer days for hiking and finding photographs to take in perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles and subjects is what I like to specialize in. This lens will greatly enhance your experience in that 'little world' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away. I built a diffuser using a ping-pong ball over the flash so the lighting would work better. (Works great, btw). As usual, it's great Canon glass that does the trick. 
Amazing quality for an affordable price (still not cheap tho). This lens takes great quality photos and is my daytime/outdoor performer. Although I don't think the IS is equal to 1 f-stop when it comes to low light situations but it sure is very helpful at these high f-stop numbers 
I got this lens to complement my 10-22mm and 100-400mm lenses. It is a great general purpose lens (not too wide, not too narrow) for everyday walk around shooting. The image stabilization and constant aperture are nice features. It is also weather sealed so you don't have to worry about the elements as much as with most other lenses, of course you would need a weather sealed camera body to be completely safe, but it still makes me feel a little better in sandy or snowy conditions. I use this on the Rebel XT and Rebel XTi which are 1.6X crop bodies and make this closer to a 38-168mm which can be useful for portrait work, landscapes, large animals, or somewhat close macro. Of course there are lenses that do all of these things better, but to get this all in one package is really valuable. After all you are less likely to miss a shot if you have 1 versatile lens vs. 5 really great specialized lenses (not that you shouldn't get those too, but this is a good all around contender.) I have posted a few photo examples above to show the range of colors and versatility of this lens. It is not the sharpest lens I have, nor the fastest, but it is the one that is on my camera most often unless I am going out to shoot something specific. If you don't want to spend quite as much, the 28-135mm is also a very good lens 
I picked up a 5D in March with a 28-135. Worked with that for 3 months and felt something was missing. I went and bit the bullet, got the 24-105 and what an amazing difference it made. Color=vivid, clarity=sharp, good walk-around lens. After 4 months, I have not one bad thing to say about this lens. My suggestion, if you are looking for a lens, would be this one 
While this review is not as technical as others all I can say is the quality of the end result is well worth the money! I shot a wedding this past weekend 2 days after receiving this lens and am just going over some of the photos and all I can say is this piece of glass has given me the razor sharpness I've been looking for. I've been hesitant into jumping into the "L" lens arena but now that I'm here I could never go back! Don't settle for less! Your photography is worth it 
Yes it is a very fine lens. IS and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this I decided to sell it in favour of my EF 24-70 2.8L after 2 weeks of usage. f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier. Bokeh is also worse than the other one. the viewfinder gets darker in 1.6 crop bodies. 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size. Plus the macro option is weaker on this one. If you don't care about the weight go with the EF 24-70 2.8L imho. 
My first L lens and I'm sold. While I did spend a lot of time - a lot, this isn't a small purchase - on deciding between this and the 24-70/2.8, I feel I made the right decision. First, I took into account what I actually shot. Not what I thought about shooting or wanted to shoot, but what I really spent my time shooting. Then I backed that up by looking at the past six months' worth of photos. For me, this is the right choice. The big decision wasn't over image quality - rather it was the max aperture. 2.8 vs 4.0. The 4.0 with IS won. I absolutely LOVE the IS! Even at higher speeds, IS rocks. (It also eats batteries like a Hummer guzzles gas) OK, so shooting with it is a dream. Incredibly fast focus. Wonderful fit and finish. I could gush all night. If you're spending a lot of time trying to justify it, don't. If it won't break your bank, it's well worth it. If you're trying to decide which lens, try what I did. It made all the difference to me. What's the downside? I'm ordering a 17-40 today. The L lens bug has bitten. Next will have to be the 70-200/2.8. There goes the kids college fund. :- 
I own several Canon lens for my 20D and this is hands down the best. I had a 28-135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews, and I got many excellent photos with it - this is distinctly better in all ways. (Of course, it costs a lot more). Recently went with the grandchildred to Sea World and I got 100% good photos, with several really outstanding ones. It is light, accurate and has IS - what more do you want? You can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it. Bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment. If you have one lens, this is the one 
This is a great range for use as an every day walk around lens. It's very versatile, light and produces great image sharpness throughout the range. There is a bit of vignetting at the wide end, which I actually like. However, being f4, this lens is simply not fast enough for me. I shoot a lot of images where I want the out of focus areas (bokeh) to be glassy smooth (for weddings, portraits and such) and you cannot get that with this lens as good as you can with the 24-70 f2.8. The 24-105 f4 lens does have image stabilization which will help you to hand hold and get the shot in lower light situations, but there is not much that can be done to get super smooth bokeh with it. If you zoom all the way in, your DOF will be low and pretty darn smooth though in my case, I just prefer the look and bokeh of the 24-70 overall rather than this lens. Although the 24-70 is super heavy in weight compared to the 24-105. But I'm a professional photographer and so while my needs and likes are geared towards preferring the 24-70 f2.8, this doesn't mean the 24-105 isn't ideal for many if not most. 
I have both lenses, the 24-105 4 L IS and the 28-135 3.5-5.6 IS. I have a 20D, but my wife and I decided we each wanted a camera to ourselves so I bought the 24-105 lens along with the 30D about 2 months ago. I was so sure that I'd see a big difference with the L lens since my 70-200 2.8 IS L is such a superior lens. The thing is, I can't justify it. I've set the camera on a tripod and switched the lenses back and forth taking pictures with identical light and settings on a variety of subjects. (They both take extremely nice pictures) Maybe with a full frame sensor the difference would be apparent. At this point I like the extra reach of the 135mm. I'll let my wife use the $1200 L lens. My recommendation is: for the money on a cropped sensor camera I'd stick with the 28-135 lens 
While it isn't fashionable to use anything but a zoom lens anymore, this L series 135mm fixed focus lens is the "real deal". It is superbly sharp, and fast, and easy to use. I took it to Africa with me and was astounded with its brilliant clarity. Great for portraits... and for anything requiring a mid-length telephoto. Highly recommended 
Despite reading glowing reviews about this lens, I was still surprised to see how well it performed. The lens is SO sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes, from a distance of three quarters of a Football field away, shooting hand held, with late afternoon light, which will print a 5x7 and still look like a Pro took them! If you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and can't afford, or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures, then you should give this lens your serious consideration. 
Everyone gives this lens a rave so maybe i should approach this terrific lens from a shooting POV. Shooting wide open at f2at 135 gives your pictures a distinct quality you would never get from zooms, there isn't a zoom at this focal length that is this speed either. A few primes come close but they're nowhere near as sharp wide open. the af is fast and very accurate and the lens has a great feel on a 20d/5d/10d body even wo the battery grip of the cameras. Close up magnification of .19x to.21 therabouts is a nice bonus of this lens, letting you get closer wo being too in your face for tight headshots. I always felt that photographers usually have a sweet spot when shooting certain things like some portrait photographers like the distance the 85mm gives them when approaching a subject, turns out I'm liking the 135 focal length quite a bit for headshots and the 85 for torso and head shots. One thing I like about this 135/f2 combo is that there's enough DOF to get most of the main subject in view and focus but the background will still be blurred out. It's really great when you want the subject in focus and nothing else, as opposed to the 85 1.2 parts of the subject could melt into the background resulting in images that be a little too ethreal for some tastes. Couldn't you just stop down the 85? Sure but the relationship of the foreground to background would still be different with the 135. The 135 f2 can give a result that's juuust right. The backgrounds just a little more compressed with the foreground but the foreground is sharp but the background is gone. Almost like you lurred the background in photoshop. But you'll never get the same results from blurring in photoshop, for one thing the highlights would get muddied in a blur treatment in PS while the highlights stay clean at f2. Don't just use this thing for portraits, use it the way you would use a 50mm and try and frame as such, again the focal lenth and wide aperture will give an interesting result. I basically use it for candids and portraits during a wedding. Fantastic lens, very sharp, very handholdable, the focal length is terrific for portraits and the bokeh is very beautiful, equal in sharpness to the 85 1.2 or any of Canon's $5k lenses. This is probably the best lens you can get for the price, the only lens I've used with better saturation and contrast is the 35 1.4L. Downside: Not as handholdable as the 50,35 1.4 or the 85 1.2 during low light situations due to it's focal length 
At a recent NYE event, I shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness clarity of this lens performance. Its so fast and the colors are vibrant. I am not a seasoned pro but with the 20D and this lens, it makes me look pretty close. I did shoot in manual and once I got my aperture shutter speed dialed in, it pumped out a lot of great pics. I have also shot some pics of waterfalls (slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image) and portraits of people and again, it oozed excellence. The 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom, but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience 
If you don't want to get hooked on canon L series lens, do not buy this one. I made a mistake of buying one and now all I want are L canon lens. It is super sharp, contrast and saturation is fantastic. No need to retouch any of your photos. So far, I've used it on candid shots of my kids and dance gigs. f/2.0 helps a lot to get the right shutter speed to freeze action. A very good buy. I got mine here at Amazon 
Man. what a lens!!! It's not cheap, and I dont' find the 135mm to be a particularly useful focal length with my 20D but after seeing glowing reviews of this one both at [...], I decided to buy one and try it for myself. It's not cheap at $900, but it's worth every penny. This one is an absolute stunner. I cannot believe my eyes at the sharpness at f2 and it improves very little when stopped down. The bokeh is unbelievable!!! I dont' hesitate to shoot at f2 and I don't find it necessary to stop down just to increase sharpness. The size and build is perfect although I don't like Canon's hood design. Why can't they simply make the hood with the same crincked finish of the lens?? Then they would not so easily scratch. It's beyond me. But that's not a problem with the lens itself and whenever I use this lens, I know I have one of the best lenses ever designed. It forces me to excel myself knowing that now,the only limitation is me, the photographer and not the camera or the lens. An absolute beauty. Go try it yourself. I try to shoot with this as much as possible and the results are stunning. I just wish it came with weather proofing and Image Stablization like Canon's modern lenses but that's just nitpicking. I love it as it is 
This is my all time favorite lense. Eat your hearts out Nikon, Olympus Pentex, because this baby alone is reason enough to go with Canon. I cannot begin to tell you how sharp this "L" lense is. Words fail me. On second thought, no they don't. Use this lense and you'll wind up with photos shaper than an lightening blade, clearer than a ghost's eyes, crisper than a new dawn on an uncharted island. I shot the portrait on two book covers with this lense. Did the wedding photos for my best friend's wedding and every one turned out better than the ones they paid the wedding pro hundreds of dollars to do. I'm documenting the growth of my child with this lense and I've caught hundred's of my girl's smiles with it and yes, sometimes even a tear or two. You cannot go wrong with a Canon "L" lense. They are the tops, they really are. Jack Priest, Sailor Home from the Se 
This lens is the best in its class. I wish every lens I had was this sharp. This thing is top notch 
Bought this lens a few months back and shot volleyball with it, occasionally used it for football when it got dark. What can I say or add to other reviews?? F/1.8 is great, although the lens is sharper at f/2 or 2.2. I use it near the wide open edge all the time - indoor gyms simply do not have much light. The USM autofocus is great - demoing it in the store, it seemed to nearly anticipate my actions. No rotating front filter, and it doesn't protrude, either. It's got a full time manual focus ring, so I don't have to worry about killing my autofocus motor. In combination with c.Fn 4-1, this is killer. Why the four stars? Chromatic aberration at lower apertures. I do not know where it starts to go away, because I almost never shoot in good light. This was most apparent in a shot of a recent football game. Granted, the team's jerseys were white, and the background was the pitch black of an unlit parking lot, and I had to perform a 100% crop. Nevertheless, an alien-like purple halo surrounded the huddled offensive team. Oh well, you can't have it all! As for volleyball pics, this is the lens. I regularly shoot at f/2.2, ISO 1600, and 1/500, but I might change that soon because that is pushing it. The photos are pretty sharp and the USM definitely helps here. I bought this lens because my 50mm 1.8 just wasn't cutting it - I'd get shots with a tack sharp background and a beautifully bokeh'd subject - just the opposite of what it should be. Using the 85mm removed about 85% of those shots. There are still extreme instances when I swing my camera around and instantly shoot when the USM can't keep up, but there are other instances when I am amazed that it got the shot in focus. From the sidelines, 85mm is too long to get the outside hitter nearest to you, but that's why you move around! Shooting volleyball requires a strategy. The focal length is also good on my 350d for shooting events and staying a bit back from the subject. I'm overall pretty pleased with the lens. I can see what many people call this a "hidden L lens. 
I recently purchased this lens along with the 24-105mm as a part of the fall cash in with cannon rebate program. So, originally, my main reason to get this lens was because it would save me another $50 off of the other lens via doubling the rebates and make it pretty cheap. But now that I have used it for awhile, I am really happy that I got it. The 1.8 maximum aperture does two things really well, lets you take low-light handheld shots and isolates the subject. See my example photos for examples of both of these features. I use this on the Canon Rebel XT and Rebel XTi which have a 1.6X crop factor and make this lens more like a 135mm which is good and bad depending on your usage. This lens produces very sharp results and doesn't weigh much, so it is easy to carry around. If you already have a good range of zoom lenses and are looking for something that will just take really nice, sharp, handheld shots, consider this lens 
All the reviews about this lens are all true. It's a great lens. I love the quality of it. However, if you like to take in door photoes and don't have very big rooms, you might want to consider the 50mm f/1.4. I mostly find my self backed up in a corner trying to take a picture at home 
This lens changed it all for me. I was happy with my Tamrons and Tokinas - I thought. Then I bought this lens. The colors and contrast simply POPPED out from the pics. It is amazing! While there's no red ring around it, it deserves one. The difference in the shots was incredible. It's very well built, focuses (like all Canon USM lenses) fast and quiet and provides the photog with truly beautiful bokeh. For low light, it's awesome. Using an extension tube for macro, it's great. And for portraits, it's nearly unbeatable. So what's the downside? For sure there is one: you'll be sold on Canon lenses. Since this one, I've bought five more, including two "L" series. If that's a downside, so be it! Just buy the lens - you'll love it 
I am really impressed with the results I get from this lens. This is my first USM lens and 85mm is new to me. It serves me really well taking people pictures outside - fantastic background blur and fast enough for low light indoor close ups. Full time manual focus is handy too at times. With my tamron 17-50, this lens is great combo for me 
bought this for my daughters karate tournements and i am very pleased with the quality of pictures i have gotten. this baby never comes off my xt 
Not much to add on top of the other reviews. The only thing you should be aware of is that the depth of field at f/1.8 is paper thin, which is excellent for portraits, but requires perfect focussing. The bokeh (the structure of the background blur) is nothing short of great, easily competing with much more expensive lenses. Yes, it has "L" quality 
The answer is most likely yes; since its price make it the best value for a fast canon prime lens. But before you make the $350 plunge here are few useful things to know about how it can be used. Keep in mind that I use this lens on the Rebel XT (1.6 factor), which means it provides me with an angel of view similar to 135mm on film cameras. SHARPNESS: Yes that's one feature you can count on when buying this lens. This lens produces very sharp pictures. So much so that it will blow away your 18-55 kit lens (if you have one) and all other zoom lenses. Exception to that are the L-series zooms. The sharpness difference will be obvious even in the smallest of prints (4 by 6). If you can't envision such difference then consider this. Sharpness can be viewed as contrast between the edges of different color objects. Hence, the sharper an image the greater the contrast in the edges between such groups of color. This lens captures the contrast in such setting better than most other lenses. SPEED: This lens is blazingly fast. As such you will have the opportunity to shoot at higher shutter speeds wide open (remember the inverse relation between aperture and shutter speed). More importantly you gain the ability to shoot in low light situations (concert for example) and still maintain a decent shutter speed for handholding. Here's the best part, if you're like most new people to photography, you probably plan to take self portraits. This lens will give you that ability, as you will be able to buy few clamp on lights coupled with 100-150W bulbs and start shooting at medium ISO speeds wide open. ANGEL OF VIEW: Assuming you will be using this lens on a 1.6 digital format consider that you will be having a tight crop, more like that of a 135mm lens on a film camera (1.6*85=136). What does that translate to in practical terms? You will have to stand 6-8 feet away from your subject to be able to cover their head and shoulders at landscape orientation. SPECIAL EFFECTS: Here are two special effects you will find useful in this lens depth of field and compression. To some degree or another every lens offers depth of field, which can be summarize as having only the subject of interest in focus and the rest of the picture blurred. This lens is unique in that it creates a very shallow depth of field in which the subject is truly isolated from the whole scene. Set the aperture to 1.8 and focus correctly and you can achieve such results. More importantly the lens quality of such blur (known as bokeh) is outstanding as there are eight diaphragm blades that control the aperture opening vs. 5 or 6 in many other lenses. As for compression, since the camera is a telephoto it will compress everything in its sight closer together to fit in its sight. For example, if you are photographing a person, their face will look wider and their nose will look smaller or flatter. Keep in mind that unlike some of the longer telephoto lenses (300mm for example) the effect with this lens is subtle and pleasant SIZE AND BUILD: Its size and weight are perfect! It balances my XT very nicely. So much so, that I can take pictures at very low shutter speeds with this combination (though I don't find my self doing that that often with this fast lens). All this translates to comfort and confidence when I am shooting with this lens. The build quality is excellent, I find no inherit weakness in the design. If you plan to photograph friends and family then this is the lens. You will take sharp pictures with the right kind of effects for portraits like compression and beautiful bokeh. The lens is fast and designed excellently for maximum control and comfort. You won't miss a shot because of shake with slow shutter speeds and even if you do (that's a big if) you can put its speed to use by dialing a higher aperture. It's only draw back is that it has a pretty tight angel of view on 1.6 factor SLRs. I can't think of any other prime in the non-L canon line up that matches this lens (other than possibly the 50mm 1.4). Truly an incredible value, buy it with confidence! Ps. By no means does this review cover all the merits of this lens. To name a couple, the lens offers precise auto focus and low chromatic aberration. Rather, I covered the features that were most useful for its intended purpose; taking pictures of people. 
I decided to rave about this lens after taking about 80 portraits, or head shots, for a children's theater production. I set the aperture at 1.8 and shot away inside a temple with great indirect soft lighting. And the results were exquisite! The background, located five feet behind the subjects was a subtle blur while the subjects came to life (with single strands of hair resolution). Not bad for my first experience shooting portraits. Now the better part is that I get equal or better results with the thousands of pictures I have taken at high school basketball games. I set my ISO to 400 on my Digital Rebel XT and get shutter speeds of 1/200 to 1/1250. Again, the intended subject jumps out. And there is no red eye (or white eye) from using a flash to light the scene and freeze the action. So after much experimenting, I prefer this to my 70-200 f4/L and my 24-105 f4/L IS lenses as an indoor sports lens. I love all these lenses. This one wins in the area of price and being the fastest lens. This is my lens of choice for a majority of my current shooting situations. 
This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens. I got this filter for a friend of mine for his Nikon 18-70mm ED DX lens. 
I bought this to keep the dust of Iraq out of my Canon EF-S 17-85 lens. It does a fine job and I've seen no noticeable change in the quality of images that I'm capturing with my Canon 20D 
I bought this filter to put on the front of the 18-70 DX lens on my Nikon D50. It works well and protects the front element of the lens from dust, dirt, fingerprints and whatnot. It seems to cause a little vignetting (slightly darkened corners) at extreme wide angles (~18mm) -- but from what I've seen so far it isn't terribly noticeable, 'specially for the price 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid conical three and three quarters inch long offers some protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. There is nothing more irritating than reviewing your images to find dust spots or other flaws. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing an expensive L lens. This hood is manufactured for the Canon 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L EF lens and normally comes included with the lens when sold new. There is no need to buy one with the lens as Amazon often suggests. Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. Fortunately Canon provides a storage case with the lens that can be used in addition to your camera bag. While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. PROS: Improves contrast and image quality Offers limited protection to the lens CONS: Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the len 
This hood comes with the 100-400, so don't buy it separately. Pros: - Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element. - Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile 
The 10D is an outstanding digital camera. I have been using both of mine for over a year now and they have done everything I needed, when I needed it, wthout a single flaw. I really use the 10D. I have taken over 30,000 pictures with it. I use the optional 2 battery Bg-Ed on the 10D which gives me an easy 400 pictures. The 17-40 Canon Zoom Lens has worked spotlessly as well. Pictures are crisp. Easy manual focus and the auto focus works well even in low light. I like the solid feel of the 10D, especially with the 2 battery pack, and 550EX flash. I shoot exclusively on manual mode so I can't comment on the other settings. Adjusting the flash output, ISO etc are all easy and quick. I have found this to be a very intuitive camera. The viewing screen on the back of the camera is clear and gives me good feedback for adjusting my flashes or hot lights. I use Lexar 1GB CompactFlash cards. And I carry an Epson P-2000 Multimedia Storage Viewer for my back up. The only drawback that I have found has been with a couple of my women friends who have found it a bit heavy. I have not only gotten use to its weight but have come to really appreciate the "feel" of the camera. I can tell you that I will NEVER use film again. With an Epson Photo 2200 printer, iPhoto and my own digital darkroom thanks to Photoshop CS I have everything I need right here at home. For downloading the pictures to my MacIntosh G4 or Powerbook I use a firewire SanDisk Reader. It too works perfectly. So if you don't need the increased megapixal of the 20D I would suggest you consider the 10D. One great camera. 
Since there are tons of rave reviews about the features of this camera, I won't bother you with the details. Instead, I will tell you about the one HUGE letdown of this camera and the likes (Rebel, 20D): the 1.6x focal length factor. This means my dear 28-105 lens is now a sorry 45-170. To recoup the loss I'd have to spend $700 on a 17-40 4.0 lens. This is a consequence of using a small CCD. Cameras like the 1D with full-size 35mm CCD sell for over $4,000. I cannot wait for that price to go down. I also cannot help to wonder whether the focal reading of the Speedlite flashes will be correct (I own a 540EZ and discovered with dismay that it doesn't work in these cameras). I look at my A2 (still infatuated with it) and I wonder if I did the right thing. I think I will keep it around for a while, just in case.. 
I've used the Canon EOS 10D for 5 months now and I'm absolutely thrilled with it. The EOS cameras are extremely comfortable to hold and handle. In auto mode, the camera produces correctly exposed, sharp photos. Unlike my Canon Powershot, the camera takes the picture with very little delay after depressing the shutter button. In the creative zones, you can set aperture priority to take, for example, selective focus shots, or use shutter speed priority and set a slow shutter speed to take some good blurring shots. The auto focus is quick and accurate, though how much of that is the camera and how much is the lens I do not know. I never use the manual focus mode. The pop-up flash works great for lighting subject that are in shadows or back lit. I now find it a bit frustrating to use my film camera; I'm addicted to viewing my shots on the spot. I have a Canon EOS A2 film camera that I purchased in 1995. Since I'm familiar with the EOS system and have Canon system lenses, I chose the 10D over the similarly priced Nikon prosumer digital camera. I like my Canon cameras so well that I bought the Canon digital Elf for my sister and the Canon Powershot A80 for my mother. Both have reportedly been excellent cameras. With the 10D, I've used a Canon 50mm/compact macro, a Tamron 28-200mm and a Canon 15mm fisheye lens. Because of the difference in the way a film camera and this digital camera operate, you multiply the focal length of the lens by 1.6 to figure the effective focal length when used with a digital camera. So, for example, the 15mm fisheye lens is effectively a 24mm lens on the 10D. I bought a 1 gig IMB microdrive storage card and that allows me to take 400 high res jpg or about 160 raw format files. If you shoot in auto mode, the camera will only capture in jpg format. If you shoot in manual mode, you can select jpg or raw format. If shooting raw format, ensure you have a software program, such as Photoshop CS, that will open raw files. And know that not all developing and printing shops will accept raw format. But many of the image libraries will ONLY accept raw files (or a high resolution tif scanned from a slide). With the raw format files, I've found that many of my shots require a bit of exposure adjustment, but this is simply a matter of moving a slider bar in Photoshop CS. When you first open a raw file, you get an adjustment window allowing you to play with exposure, tint, saturation, white balance and more. You can even simulate warmup filters and such. Very cool stuff! I bought an extra battery to take along on trips. One battery typically lasts me for 2 days of shooting, as long as I don't do much reviewing of my shots through the camera monitor. Unless you need the quality of the 1Ds immediately I would recommend getting the 10D because technology is moving so fast that the quality of the 1Ds will be available for the current price of the 10D in the near future 
This camera is everything I desired in a digital camera and so much more. While other kids played baseball and football I grew up with a Pentax MX strapped around my neck. Photography was and is my passion. This camera allows me the expression I always dreamed of. Combined with Adobe Photoshop, this is the best camera/darkroom setup I've ever worked with 
This lens bag is a fine product but don't be fooled into adding it as an accessory to Canon's 1.4x or 2x extenders. Both of them come with this exact pouch. Amazon should remove this as a "Suggested Accessory" on the web pages for the two products above 
This timer/cable release has a lot of features. Works well. The cord is somewhat short though, and it is of cheap plastic construction. Hard to imaging that it costs this much. I think it's over priced. But it does the job. 
I've had my remote switch for almost 3 months now. I love it. So far the only feature I have used is the remote switch and it works flawlessly. If you want to trip the shutter from a distance without shaking the 20D (the camera I use) this is what you need. I use it with the extension cord since I am generally about 30 feet away from the camera. I am very pleased with this purchase. No complaints at this point 
I also received this remote with only the international warranty. I called Amazon and they immediately sent me out a replacement free of charge; Yeah. But alas, it too had the international warranty; @#$%!. I have returned both, unopened and unused on their dime. Perhaps this is the only version they have 
Well I too have recieved a "grey market" version of the product, with an international warranty only. As this has been mentioned before, and apparently has been rectified by Amazon, I hope I'll recieve the same treatment. But this still troubles me. Is Amazon continuing to sell off cheaper merchandise, only addressing the issue on an individual basis when people complain? What grey market means is that the product was originally intended for sale outside the US, but has been imported because that version of the product is cheaper than the version intended for US sale. While it's a legitimate enough process, they should be telling us if they do it, because the warranty has been invalidated by being sold outside the boundaries of the system Canon has put in place. I'm not even touching the hardware until I find out what's going on about it, so I can't rate its quality.. but I have no doubt that it's a quality piece of hardware, I've never heard anyone have anything bad to say about it, except its price, a gripe I totally agree with. Let's face it folks, if it wasn't a proprietary accessory to a high priced camera system, it should really cost about $20. It's just a simple programmable timer no more sophisticated than most wristwatches 
I have had this product for over two years and used it extensively in my travels. Yes it has shortfalls and "may" be considered expensive, but for the price it is better than some other "aftermarket" designs for other Camera makes. For amature timelapse and timed exposures it works quite well. As far as a remote for instant low light or exposure shots it is expensive, get the Canon RS-80N3 Shutter release The biggest complaints seems to be the limited number of shots [99] in certain modes and the shortness of the connecting cable length. Using the "continous" mode I have not failed to capture timelapse photos that filled my needs. The short connecting cable can be corrected by purchasing the Canon ET-1000N3 extension cable [33 ft]. Now that at $2.50+ a foot, is expensive! But in my persuit of remote control capability a must have. Battery life is fantastic, thousands of shots and still going strong. Of course like camera battery a spare is a blessing [and in this case cheap]. I think it is a good accessory, if you enjoy time lapse and have spent the money for one of the new EOS cam's then the price is comparable to your continuing outlay for your hobby. A "gadgeteers must".. Too each their own, that is what supports "Horse Races". Enjo 
I was somewhat surprised to receive my TC80N3 with only an Canon international warranty....did anyone else receive a grey market version of this remote control? I have ordered $1000s of Canon products from Amazon.com and always received a Canon USA warranty card with the items....not sure why this item didn't carry the USA warranty. I have sent several emails to Amazon.com regarding this matter. I'll update the review when I receive an answer that is satisfactory. PLEASE NOTE: Amazon is shipping a replacement remote! I'll amend again once the replacement is received. Control itself is a wonderful product but for this price I DID expect a Canon USA warranty card. Gar 
The ability to combine four different delay and interval modes makes this product able to accommodate almost any automatic-shooting situation. You can control the delay until the sequence starts, the delay between shots, the total shooting time, and the number of shots. That last one, however, is where the glaring flaw comes in: The controller is limited to 99 shots when you use the total-number-of-shots setting. In correspondence I've had with Canon, they have had no explanation for this asinine limitation. Even a modest CF card these days holds more than 99 shots, even in raw mode. For time lapse, 99 shots is woefully inadequate. You can work around this defect by simply letting your card fill up or by doing the math and using the total-duration setting. But sometimes you want to shoot multiple sequences on one card. If you know you want about 300 frames (for example), it's annoying to have to baby-sit the camera and stop it manually, or to do the math and figure out how many seconds total your sequence will take, convert that to minutes and seconds, and then dial that into another setting on the controller. And if you then decide to use a different interval, you get to re-do all that. Dumb, Canon. The fact is, this device shouldn't be necessary anyway. Every camera today should come with this functionality; it's technically trivial, since every one of these digital SLRs is a computer with plenty of on-board timers and logic for this task 
This remote is a handy tool to have. It's very basic use is as a shutter release. It's best to use a shutter release for when your camera in on a tripod in low light situations. Using the shutter release in this way helps to limit camera shake which improves your images. Other programmable features include a self timer, interval timer, long exposure, and exposure count. You are permitted to use any combination all or none of these settings making the possibilities virtually limitless. I have used to self timer so that I could both take the picture, and be in it. The self timer can be set for just shy of 100 hours if you wanted to. For time lapse, a combination of the interval timer which can be set for just shy of 100 hours and the exposure count which can be set for up to 99 shots should be set. The self timer can be used to delay the first shot if desired. The long exposure can also be set up to just shy of 100 hours. The settings can be entered at any time without worry of inadvertent alterations. Pressing the light button until the hold indicator is displayed will deactivate all but the light button or prevents the stop/start button from being deactivated once an operation has been started. The TC-80N3 is operated by one CR2032 battery. I've had my remote for over 2 years and the battery is still going strong. I'm not sure how long the battery is supposed to last, but there is an indicator in the display panel to let me know when the battery starts to get low. If the battery is fine, I don't see the indicator at all. There is a storage place on the back for your cameras RC socket cover if you have one. I use this with a Canon 20D so it is of no use to me. The plug connects to the camera simply by pressing the plug into the socket. To disconnect, pinch the plug on the side and pull out. For me, this item is a must have. I enjoy low light photography and I get plenty of use just for this reason. It's great to have the option available for other photographic opportunities. It is clear to me that this is a well thought out, quality product by Canon. PROS: Acts as a simple shutter release Programmable options include a self timer, interval timer, long exposure, and exposure count CONS: Cable only about 34 inche 
Made of a durable nylon outer shell and a soft lining in the interior, this soft case offers the ability to protect your lens. The double front zipper easily opens to reveal easy access to the lens cavity. The top of the zippered flap is secured in place with Velcro for a solid seal. Securely attached to the sides of the case are D rings. These rings are used to snap the quarter inch thin shoulder strap in place for carrying the case and lens around. If this carrying option doesn't appeal to you, a belt loop is included on the back of the strap for carrying the case and lens attached to your belt, or possible your camera bag if it accepts attachments. The bottom of the case features a cardboard lined fake leather surface allowing the lens to rest standing on solid surfaces such as a table. This case is meant for use with the 180mm f/3.5L, 70-200mm f/2.8L, 80-200mm f/2.8L 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L EF lenses. These L lenses normally come with the case when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. However if your case is worn, replacing it to protect your lens is recommended. PROS: Protects your glass investment Durable construction Built for mobility outside of your camera bag CONS: I cannot think of an 
I want to protect my lens. While not the most expensive, the Canon is adequate for what I nee 
I never take my UV filter off of my lens unless I am going to immediately put on a different filter. There are basically two camps out there, those that feel you should always use a UV filter to protect your lens from dirt and scratches and those that feel it is a waste of time and only degrades your image. Well, I tried going without one for awhile and then dirt started to build up on the front element of my very expense lens. And although you can clean the front element of a lens, I feel much, much safer wiping my comparatively cheap UV filter time and time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage. I think for the nearly unquantifiable loss in image quality you may suffer by having a UV filter on, it is well worth the extra piece of mind it gives me 
I picked up the Canon 350d while I was in Italy. I was thinking to upgrade the camera to another Canon that didn't have the built in flash. This flash is great, I've only used it a few times, but I am more than impressed by it's functionality. In the title, I only said "oops" because I think it's more flash than I really need, at least for this camera. Overall, I am more than impressed with this flash 
Super easy to use and significantly extends your flash photo distance over in-camera flashes. Versatile flash direction accommodates multiple scenarios and moods 
I bought this flash for my Canon 30D because of the numerous promises Canon makes for how it performs with all of the 30D's automatic and manual functions...and they are RIGHT! In spite of it's relatively small size, it is THE most powerful flash I've used of any brand. Having replaced a non-Canon brand flash that was supposed to work with the 30D but didn't, I could not be more delighted with the 580X. Whether you're shooting in AV, TV, P, or M modes, you will not be disappointed with its performance. It's expensive; but it's worth the price if you rely on your flash to perform to your camera's capabilities 
I hesitated for a year to upgrade from the 550 to the 580 because, on paper, I did not see much advantage. In fact, the 580 is a worthwhile upgrade. I like the new dial on the back for adjusting exposure compensation, etc. and the catchlight screen is a nice touch but the biggest advantages are the incredibly fast recycling time and smailler size. I can machine gun my 1Ds2 and this flash keeps up. The 550 could not. It is small enough not to overwhelm my little Rebel too. I did note that there is some vignetting at 24mm with a direct flash unless I drop the wide lens screen. The manual says ths will not happen but it does. Not a big deal since I use a Gary Fong diffuser or bounce flash almost always 
Like most every Canon accessory, the 580EX is well made and very expensive. I cheaped out when I bought my Digital Rebel and bought the Sigma EF-500 DG, which was represented as being "almost as good as" the Canon 580EX. That appears to be true. The problem is that "almost" leaves me with no master/slave lighting. So when I picked up a EOS 30D, I bit the bullet and paid the big bucks for the Canon. It works as advertised and nicely makes the Sigma the slave it was really born to be 
I'll spare the technical review of the 580ex Flash for now. I've been using this new flash for on-the-go shootings and find it very helpful especially with the capabilities of using multi flash units and off-shoe mode. It's great on hard to reach places where I want to produce more light or fast moving subjects, i.e. wedding guests and fast pets. I do plan to pick up at least 2 more of these units for it's compatibility on the most part. Not only that I can get good light coverage on the subjects, but the possibilities of making a more interesting artistic photographs that defines my work. Still nothing beats the use of the higher end lighting kits like Profoto Acute systems. But that's alot to lug around. 
The 580EX is a wonderful flash and I would not hesitate to buy it again. In fact I might even buy a second one. There are however a couple of issues that you should be aware of. 1. The battery compartment door takes a little getting used to. You may feel like you are going to snap it off at first. Not really a big deal though. 2. (and in my opinion this IS a big deal). The `Auto Focus Assist' is completely useless. Its just an LED pointed through a rather bad `lens'. It won't do anything past a couple of feet. A laser diode with diffraction grating would have made it work far past the useable flash distance and at this price Canon should know better. All told however it is a wonderful flash. The circular command dial make adjusting the flash exposure easy (dial in more or less flash relative to ambient light). If you do not have an external flash get one. It makes a huge difference. And this is a great offering. 
Good basic set of inexpensive filters. Nice case. Great for a beginner/starting set. If you're willing to spend more money on filters, getting B+W or Hoya will suit you better. 
I feel that these filters are not required if you have digital camera the coze you you can do what ever you like by computer graphics programs only the UV protector is important 
Excellent performance, at a reasonable price. Highly recomend this product 
I have found that Tiffen filters offer unlimited possibilites. With this kit you get three great filters. Most important being the Circular Polarizer. If you are shooting outdoors it is a must have. You also get the 812 warming filter which I have found to bring great depths of warmth to photographs. Filters protect lenses and Tiffen I have found to be great quality and this is a great value 
...in that it diffuses the light energy of the flash in different directions, essentially turning the flash into a point light source. The light going off in different directions then bounces off nearby objects to fill in the shadow areas on the subject, making for a more pleasing softer look, especially on people. Note of caution: because this device diffuses the light from the flash, it takes much more energy per flash. Using the Stofen will drain your battery much quicker (about 4X in my experience) and it takes the flash much longer to fully charge after each shot, say 8-10 seconds vs 2-3s. Always keep a spare set of flash batteries with you. Another note...because it requires bouncing light of nearby objects to be effective, using this outdoors is not recommended. You're better off removing the omni-bounce and aiming the flash directly at the subject (and living with the harsh lighting). 
This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer. Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash. It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage. When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed. The white box is for general use. Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect. PROS: Inexpensive solution for better flash photography. A quality product that works. CONS: Non 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
This is my lens for handheld images of birds in flight. It's sharp and exhibits no color fringing or other chromatic aberration. By comparison, my Leitz 400mm f/6.8 Telyt shows a fair amount of color fringing outside the center region. To be fair, the Telyt is a much simpler design. The Telyt does have higher contrast than the EF 400mm f/4 DO IS, but a levels layer in Photoshop can fix that. The 400mm f/4 DO IS is much lighter than any 400mm f/4 lens with conventional optics. DO lenses have a diffraction element that compensates for the color dispersion of spherical lens elements. It also reduces optical complexity and size. The f/4 speed makes autofocus faster, and allows even better isolation of subjects using narrow depth of field. While bigger and heavier than Canon's 400mm f/5.6L, the f/4 lens is light enough at 4.3 pounds that it's still easy to carry. I've used mine on hikes above 10,000 feet to photograph bighorn sheep. IS definitely makes a difference handheld, and on a tripod below 1/125 second. Canon's 400mm f/5.6L is a non-stabilized lens. I've taken some of my sharpest wildlife images with this lens - you can see every feather in some bird shots. Highly recommended if you can afford one. 
I am a technology guru and this camera is simple to use and has great results. The touch screen is awesome!!! Battery life is so much better than other cameras i have owned. I think this one will outlast and perform any of them. BUY IT NOW if you want a quality camera that will make you happy!! 
I am not the most experienced photographer, but this camera takes terrific pictures, in my opinion. Nice big LCD screen and the touch screen is a great feature 
Quick, compact, light and brilliant pictures but lacking veiw finder and "anti-shake" syste 
Photos were excellent. But photo print quality depends very much on the print shop. For the same photo file, it can look like a 4M photo when taken to a below quality printer shop. Photos taken indoor with marginal lighting (no flash used) turned out to be yellowish. Battery life is very long despite its large 3" LCD. Battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long. Photos files viewed on computer looks just great. 8'x10' prints are great but have not tried larger prints. Touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set. Date on photo is red (would be better if it is black). And the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner 
Camera works great for us so far... we had a 3 year old digital camera so this was an upgrade to better technology... takes much better pictures than our old one... the video is great (except in very low light)... we've taken a lot of short video clips of our kids for grandma (etc)... nobody in our family wants to watch more than about 5 minutes of any one home video anyway... so this camera saves us from having to buy a camcorder... (although with our 1GB card we could take 45 minutes or so of continuous video at the medium setting)... the touch screen is great and simple... the camera has quick response time and the indoor and action pictures are again great for pictures of our kids running around or birthday parties... I took about 92 minutes of video and 55 pictures (plus sharing images and videos with others) before the battery ran out for the first time (a couple of weeks of shooting in our family). I guess everyone has their own needs when picking a digital camera, but this one works great for ours 
The camera is a superb, light-weight wonder. The controls are logical and the large display area is amazing. I love it. 
A good quality filter set at a great price. I was so happy with it I purchased sets for all my lenses and cameras! The same filters in my local camera store is more than double in price 
If you would like a list of sites with reviews email gumby (at) dontquotemeonthat (dot) com Pros: Great sharpness even wide open (wayyyyy better than the F2.8 zooms at F2.8). nice weight and size. shallow DOF in a wide angle lens. Cons: Lateral CA glows purple and green in close and distant bokeh. Watch for high contrast situations. My first copy was DOA. No weather seal. Hood is too tight. Pros: Fantastic! This is one excellent piece of glass. Incredible in low light, with vibrant clarity and color. Well balanced with 20D/Batter pack or a 1D. Cons: None what so ever. if your a newbie here's some info A lens is "fast" when it has a low f-stop... ok so when you have a smaller number the apature is bigger which allows more light through, so this means you can up the shutter speed. and still have enough light reach the sensor. ok so lets say you have an out door shot if you have say an f/4 lens the shutter speed could be 1/250 of a second and you would get a good exposer. Now this lens can only go f/4 but if you in the same outdoor setting, had an f/2.8 lens you could jump to 1/500 of a second and get the same exposer. and freeze the action mmore effectivly, this i believe is why it's a "fast" lens. ok have fun and get it done 
This is a great lens if you need to shoot wide angle in very low light siuations. If you don't need a lens for this exact purpose, you'd be better off spending a few extra dollars on either the 16-35L or 24-70L. These two zoom lenses cover 24mm (and more) at a very reasonable f2.8 with good results. They won't bag a shot in the shadows, but they will handle any decently lit scenario with ease. If you just have to own an f1.4 prime lens, the 35mm f1.4 is a much more universally well-regarded L lens than the 24mm f1.4. The 50mm f1.4 is 1/3 the price of either and just as amazing in my opinion so long as you don't need the wide angle. The only reason I give the 24mm f1.4 a 4 instead of a 5 is the price 
You'll never regret buying the Canon L series. The fit and finish is perfect and image quality is excellent 
If you have the big lenses (400mm f/2.8L IS USM or even the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM) this is totally worth the addition. The 2x does NOT kill the autofocus on the f/2.8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges. Check compatability on Canon's website. You won't be disappointed 
What a great little piece of kit. It's great with my EF 70-200mm f/4L. The only drawback is you've no AF. You are forced to use manual focus. Now this isn't a big problem, unless you're photographing wildlife or moving objects. Well worth the price though and very useful 
Just received Canon EF 2X II from Adorama. Paid $279.95 plus $17.95 shipping. Len has been previously used and placed back in the pouch and sold as new. Len cap is marred with several scratches. Looks to have been handled rough. My advice is bypass Adorama as a third party vendor and buy directly from Amazon. Adorama refunds within 14 days less shipping. Thats $17.95 for me to return a used product sold as new. Won't go there again 
This high quality extender is a great addition to my Canon EF 70-200 L f/4 !! With a top-notch build quality and a tough, weather resistant design equal to that of their highly respected line of L lenses, Canon has produced a great product for its unbeatable zoom lens !! Although the 2X extender renders the A/F function useless on many Canon cameras, I found this to be a Very small drawback overall ( I prefer to manually focus under many of my shooting conditions). This extender is more suited for a low f/number lens due to the 2-stop change in brightness, but it is still VERY effective with my f/4 in normal lighting. A lightweight and fairly inexpensive way to double your focal length, while maintaining the incredible optical quality of the main lens...My backpack will always contain my 2X and 1.4X extenders ! 
Manufactured of a soft gray felt like material, a tough leather bottom, and draw string closure at the top, this lens pouch helps protect your lens from dust and the elements. I store my lenses in a camera bag, and these cases fit nicely around the lens taking up little precious space. This case is meant for use with the Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM, EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM, EF 24-105mm f/4.0L USM, EF 28-70 F/2.8 L, EF 50 F/1.0 L USM, EF 85mm f/1.2L USM lenses. These L lenses normally come with the case when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. However if your case is worn, replacing it to protect your lens is recommended. PROS: Protects your glass investment CONS: I cannot think of an 
When digital cameras first came out, I, like many people swore I'd always be loyal to film. Digital could never take the place of film. I'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely. There's still something I love about putting a roll of film in the camera, shooting away, sending the film to be processed, and seeing the results. I also know it's a bit expensive. I know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion, but digital cameras are improving in this regard, and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving, we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital SLR and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera. So I figured now is the time to get a digital SLR. I have been a loyal Nikon user for nearly ten years, and have owned the Nikon N60, N70, and N80. My first love was, and still is the N70 (I've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought I was the only person who loved the N70). I purchased the N80 only after my N70 cost too much to repair, but I've enjoyed the way my various Nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if I don't have the time to use specific controls, but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes. My Nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes, wildlife shots and all sorts of other things I can't resist to capture forever. I decided to purchase the D70 since it was close to what I've already experienced with Nikon. In many ways it works in a similar way to the N70 and 80, except it's a digital rather than film version. Like the film versions of the midrange Nikon SLR's, it has a dial that allows an automatic setting, portrait, landscape, sports, close-up, nightscape, and night portrait modes, the ability to select aperture, shutter speed or manual controls. The camera has auto and manual focus abilities. Photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires. The controls are easy to use, though it takes practice to be comfortable. On a personal level, the camera has passed the Halloween test, niece's birthday test, and fall foliage in New England test and favorite scenic spots test. The only real difficulty I've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting. Auto focus has not worked at all and I'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots, but at this point I'm sure it's the photographer and not the camera. I do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera. The manual is very confusing. It uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else. I've had luck with the "Magic Lantern Guides" with my other cameras, but have not as of yet used it for this camera. I did purchase the NIKON D70 FIELD GUIDE (David Busch, Wiley Publishing) which has been helpful. It can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with Nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography. 
I've had my D70s for about a year now, haven't regretted it for a second. The controls are laid out logically, with everything to hand. The dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate. I personally love the optional grid overlay, I have no excuses for horizons that aren't horizontal. The wireless flash system is great, though you have to buy an SB-600 or SB-800 to get the full benefit. This camera is bigger and heavier than the D50 and D80, which in my opinion is a positive thing. 
I am a professional photographer, and I have owned this camera for nearly two years. I also have a D70 for backup. The batteries go forever, it is very quick to respond, the images are beautiful, and it has the typical Nikon durability and reliability. If you are already a Nikon user, the controls will fall easily to hand. That having been said, the computer software with this camera is a joke. For the best image quality shoot RAW files, color balance with a grey card, and render the images with software like Capture One LE. The uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars. Come on, Nikon, be real!!! Shortly after I got my first D70, I shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog. I got an ugly feeling in my gut when I was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure, cropped to the head and shoulders, and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog. By the time I found out, it was already at the printer. As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great. After that incident, I have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results. This camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button. In resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera. It is imperative to shoot RAW and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera. I can't wait to try the D80 
I do weddings, portrait, and outdoor photography and I don't see any reason why I'd ever switch from the D70 (other than the D80 :). This camera is professional grade at the consumer price point. Don't be scared by the 6.1 MP. I print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems. I'd recommend reading Thom Hogans manual 
The D70s is a minor update of the original D70 introduced in 2004, with a few new features and a slightly larger LCD. It's still a great camera, but expect it to be replaced by the new D80, which has 40 percent more pixels, a 2.5-inch LCD, and additional useful features at the old price of the D70s. So, you can probably save a little money and still purchase a sophisticated digital SLR if you wait until prices of the D70s stabilize at a new, lower level. At, say, $600, this camera would be an incredible bargain. The D70s has shined as one of the best cameras in its class since its introduction. For example, it has a 1/500th second flash synch speed (found in no other camera but the D50) so you can keep ambient light under control and avoid ghost images. Its autofocus is fast and accurate, and features both single-autofocus, continuous-autofocus (for tracking action), and a novel "automatic" autofocus mode that switches between AF-S and AF-C as required. If you have no Nikon lenses, get this camera with the 18-70mm kit lens, which is very sharp and versatile, rather than the more limited 18-55 lens. You won't regret it 
Excellent camera kit. Versatile. I have a lot to learn about the camera, though, as it is no simple point-and-shoot. However, in Auto mode, it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. I look forward to learning how to use it fully. Lenses came with warranty cards, but the camera itself did not. I bought the SB-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 GB compact flash cards to round out the kit. Camera with lens attached is large, which I underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. Great camera, though. Price was the best I could find anywhere 
It has a learning curve, that's for sure, but WOW! This camera is worht every penny, far more stable then the comparable Canon Rebel, and the product comes with better lenses. The quality of glass DOES matter 
I have owned this camera for about two months now and have taken about 100 photographs (keepers) to date. Because I have been involved in photography for almost 35 years, I have developed certain prejudices. In particular, I have never been comfortable with auto exposure and even less comfortable with auto focus. In fact, the last auto focus camera I owned was a Nikon N8008s that I ultimately sold at auction because I could not adapt to using the various auto settings. However, I like this camera. Why? The D70s is a very easy camera to use and I have only had to refer to the manual to check on a couple of settings and look up some features. Honestly, set up takes only a few minutes and handling is not terribly different from a film camera. I should point out that this camera is really designed for auto focus lenses and if you choose to use your manual focus lot, you will disable many of the camera's features.  Because I am both stubborn and cheap (but mostly only when it comes to spending money on myself) I am using my manual focus lenses on this camera. It is true that I do not get any internal exposure meter readings and must rely on a handheld Gossen or the sunny 16 rule (quite effective, really) for exposure determination. The LCD preview screen thus is critical for determining or adjusting exposure. I should also point out that the depth of field preview feature is also lost when using manual focus lenses. I was stunned when I could not stop my lens down and burrowed through the manual to find out what I was doing wrong--which was nothing except that I was using the wrong type of lens. While I really miss this feature, I am not sure how big a loss it really is because of the viewfinder. Others have made mention of the low magnification and tunnel like views through the finder and I can attest to this fact. I compared finder views to my trusty old FM and was just stunned by how poorly the D70 compared. Ultimately the best camera is the camera you use and the D70 has become my camera of choice. Even though I am using this camera like a vintage M series Leica--i.e., handheld meter and presetting exposure in anticipation of a photograph--I find that I can live with this level of usability. At some point I will probably buy an auto focus lens (maybe the 35 f2) and make full use of the feature set. But for now I content on using the camera the old fashioned way 
I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camea, its beyond description... 
This Camera is excellent one!! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category, I'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles.. Highly recommended 
I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin. I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working. The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory. The photos, however, are wonderful. Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable. (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos. 
It is extremely easy to use. Hard to figure out the menu, but once that is done there is no problem. Takes beautiful pictures. Great for action shots as well. Seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in 
I had 2 Rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses. While I had owned other digitals I keep going back to my old Rebel, until now. We got the back up battery pack. My husband and I love it 
I already had a digital rebel and was able to sell it to a co-worker and use the proceeds for my new rebel xt. Faster, lighter, better. Simple review. It took everything that was great about my digital rebel and made it better. Some complain that it feels "too light"...OK...it that's your thing. To me, it's still solid and the pictures speak for themselves. Now, with the addition of the 10 MP rebel xt, I'll bet the original xt can be purchased for an even better price. No downsides that I can think of.. 
I have had digital cameras for about 5 years and still own an Olympus 5 megapixel, and a Casio 7 megapixel. Seems like Megamixels alone just don't cut it for me. I read about the rebel XT in a magazine and looked up the user reviews here on Amazon. I decided to go and buy one and though I am really a novice, I am extremely impressed. I have never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors from a Point Shoot. I started with the basic settings and love the results.I am slowly progressing to more advanced settings and am getting better everyday. Even a novice who just wants stunning photography will be amazed with this camera. I also bought a Tamron 75-300 Autofocus zoom lens (look for it here on Amazon.com) and after lots of practice, have been able to take some great pictures. I have a brother in the UK who is also into digital photography, and after seeing some (full reso) photos I sent him, he rushed out and bought the XTi (called the EOS 400D across the pond)and is amazed with it. I still have a lot to learn but really cannot fault this camera. The included software is also excellent. For the record, some reviews seem to think it is too small to hold, I have big hands and don't have any problems at all. I admit though this is the first SLR I have ever owned. I will still keep a point and shoot to keep in my travel bag for spontaneous photography but I am in love with my Rebel XT!! This camera costs quite chunk of change but I think it is well worth it and I do recommend it to everyone 
I am a severe novice at photography and do not know much on the subject but I really wanted to take better pictures of my boyfreind who does freetstyle motocross. I was having a hard time getting the timing down and getting a good zoom with my old camera and with this camera I have been getting some amazing pictures. At first when reading the manual I became extremely overwhelmed and scared that I made a bad decision. I still do not know what the fancy functions are and how to use them. But I did find that it is very user friendly if you just go with the automatic shooting modes. I'm very excited about the wonderful picture quality I've been getting. Some of his sponsors are even using my shots for their advertisements! I highly recommend this camera!! 
It's not the best looking remote you'll ever find but the design is made practical to fit the strap. You'll never lose this remote and it works like a charm 
I decided to get this after buying the Rebel XTi and already owning the Rebel XT (this works with both.) I already had the corded shutter release which was nice when doing long exposures or macro work where even a little camera shake can make a huge difference. But this goes to a new level, you can set the camera up get everything in focus and then step back and take as many shots as you want without any risk of touching the camera. Make sure to cover the eyepiece when using this so stray light doesn't ruin your exposure. This is also handy when you want to take pictures with you in them. I have even used it with two cameras at once to get multiple angles of the same shot. I am thinking about setting up a blind and setting up the camera on a tripod to try to get some close up pictures of wildlife that would not be possible otherwise. Basically if you ever have a need to take pictures without holding the camera this is your solution 
I bought the remote control so that I could trip the shutter while my camera was on a tripod. Mostly landscape stuff. It works great for my intended use. The only minor problem is that you have to point the remote control at the front of the camera. I have found that it works fine if I hold the remote in front of, and below the lens (out of view of the lens) 
My photography does not have much call for a wireless remote but this was too easy to pass up. It delivered as advertised and I am finding that I am using it in place of a wired remote for ultra close up and low light photagraphy when using a tripod. It is very small so it is easy to pack away anywhere 
I bought this remote for canon digital rebel XT. Pretty much programs itself. Great asset that it clips to camera strap. Works from good distance. Highly recommen 
Got it. worked as per described. value for money. works both from front and behind for rabel XT(somebody wrote here it doesn't work from the back side of the camera) 
Wonderful camera. Very flexiable, very versitile. Can be the most wonderful creation device in someone whom is capable. Def a good buy now that the 30D is out. I've had this camera for over a year and I STILL love it 
Excellent Camera with high end capabilities. Easy to use and intuitive system controls 
I am just a hobbyist. This was a big purchase and a big step for me to get into this level of camera. I still haven't mastered using it yet, and I've had it for a few months. It does a wonderful job of taking pictures. If you have the right lenses, it can take some of the most beautiful pictures you've ever seen. Again, I'm just a hobbyist/enthusiast. I use it to take pictures for work, too. I highly recommend getting a couple of VERY good lenses to go with it. Don't go with the cheap lenses that Canon, Tamron, Sigma, etc. make for this camera. Do yourself a favor and get a nice zoom - spend some bucks. You'll be happy you did. The camera itself is pretty easy to use if you leave it on auto, but that's like buying a race car and never shifting out of first gear. The auto settings are great, and they do a wonderful job, but you can do so much more if you learn to use the camera in Manual, Av, Tv, or P mode. It allows you so much more creativity that you'll be amazed at the difference. The 30D came out right before I bought the 20D, and I would probably buy it for the price now, but I'm very happy with my 20D 
This camera is really great. I knew I liked it before, but I immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when I ended up with a Rebel XT as a "loaner" while my 20d was in repair. Not that the XT is a bad camera, it just doesn't really compare to the 20d. The 20d has a nice feel to it; it is fairly large, which is great since I have somewhat large hands. The features are great too. And the image quality is awesome. I don't really need to go into all of the details, as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job. Let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars. The only complaint I have about the camera is that it doesn't have spot metering. The ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d. 
Impressive feature list wih affordable price, for the serious ameteur. i've been using the 20D with 18-55, 50mm 1.8, 35-80, 80-200 and 500/1000mm lenses. i am not disappointed. i am planning to upgrade to the L series lenses but slowly. i do not mean to be over entusiastic about canon, but i am yet to see a Nikon camera with the same specs at the same or ever a near equal price. i've got the FM10 for film photography. i love both my cameras. Impressive features include: Mirror lockup ISO 3200 with noise reduction 18 custom functions accepts the entire series of canon lens. heavy metal body (no cheap plastic feel 
This camera is amazing, I couldn't have asked for more. Just be warned that the manual is pretty terrible. It's best to just play around with the camera until you figure it out, rather than wasting time trying to decipher the manual 
My kids are in competitive Tae Kwon Do. I have now used the camera my wife gave me one year ago at several tournaments. It is able to stop action and take great shots even in low lighting. Now, we tried it when we went skiing and it also worked great in the glare conditions of the snow. I bought a monopod that worked real well to stabalize and I use software called PhotoFinale to crop and share the photos. One year into the usage I am still looking forward to each chance I get to play with this "toy". Next options: battery grip, flash diffuser, extra remote flash.. 
I bought this camera about 2 months before my son was born. I knew little about Digital SLRs, but after research I found that this was the one for me. This camera is well constructed and durable. The pictures are excellent. I have blown a few of my pictures up to 11X17 without any problem. Also, if you are going to be doing any editing of photos on your computer, this camera would be great. I would recommend purchasing the newest version of Photoshop or Photoshop elements (when I bought mine it only came with Elements 2.0 and 3.0 was already on the market). Also, if you want your pictures to turn out, you MUST purchase a larger flash. The onboard flash is weak, will leave shadows and it does not allow you to do any type of "bounce" flash. On the whole, this is the best camera I have ever had in my life and it would be great for anyone who has previous experience with SLR cameras. 
I love the capacity of these batteries. Use them for my handheld GPS, digital cameras, 35MM cameras, flashes, and everything else that I can. The car power adaptor is really nice for road trips! The charger can recharge 4 batteries at a time (either AA or AAA), and can charge even the 2100 mAH batteries in under 75 minutes (under an hour for "typical" rechargeables of 1600 or fewer mAH). I do not like leaving the charger plugged in, because I can hear it clicking when there are no batteries in it (but I hear lots of things that wouldn't bother a normal person). Also, the price is pretty high. I have succesfully used other batteries in the charger (it comes with 8 2100 mAH NiMH batteries that do seem to last longer than other brands of rechargeable). Ask for it for Christmas...hope for a discount (which appears to be pretty rare for MonsterCable products) 
I have been delighted with the quality of pictures I get with this lens. The autofocus is fast and quiet, while the manual focus is very solid and smooth. I'm finally taking pictures worthy of the jewelry my partner creates 
I purchased this lens primarily for use as a macro lens. Since I shoot mostly wildlife (including bugs) I thought the field of view of 160mm (used with my Canon Rebel XT) would be just about ideal. In reality the FL was not enough. I had to approach the bugs much too close and they frequently left the scene quickly. The pictures taken with the lens were extremely sharp and the bocah (out of focus area behind the subject) was very nice. I wound up selling the lens on eBay since it didn't meet my needs 
This is a really handy lens to have in your bag. I added this lens to my collection several months ago, and I haven't regretted it one bit. I took a trip to Montana in August and used this lens to photograph a ton of wildflowers. I was also using a 70-300mm telephoto lens and a 24-70mm wide angle lens heavily, but most of my favorite shots on that trip were taken with this lens. Autofocusing is very quiet since it's USM powered, but it's often tricky to get the right focus if you're doing an extreme closeup. This is a general facet of macro lenses, so you'll probably find yourself using manual focus 90% of the time or more. The manual focus on this lens is quite excellent though, and responds well to fine adjustments. It's also quite easy for me to handhold it, as long as I have a decent amount of light or pop up the flash. With all that being said, this is a nice lens to grab after you have a decent telephoto lens, if you like photographing small things. Otherwise, you might look into getting some other lenses first, i.e. wide angle, fisheye, etc. (unless you already own all of them :-)) 
I bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting. I quickly found out, however, that to shoot Macro-only with this lens is a crime. It is a very versitile lens. Its fast f/2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light. I pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my Rebel XT eliminates most indoor oppurtunities. I frequently use this lens for family portraits, the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject. As others have stated, this is a heavy lens. It doesn't have Image Stabilization (IS) so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images. I use a beefy monopod for my best shots, although I have a lot of handheld gems... If you are tight for cash, this isn't the "one lens" that does it all. If you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits, THIS is that lens. 
This is a fantastic piece of glass. Extremely sharp and little artifacts. An awesome lens that I recommend highly. I love going to the local botanical gardens and mounting this baby on my 20D. WELL worth the cost. If you dont have a tripod, buy one 
I wanted to get a macro lens and everyone told me this was the one to get... I'm so glad I did. With the smaller sensor on my 30D, the 100mm is more like 150mm or so, so it's a nice , wide-open telephoto/portrait lens as well. I've uploaded a few photos I've taken w/ this lens to show what it's capable of in macro and telephoto. I thought the 17mm-85mm IS USM lens that came e/ my camera was sharp - but compared to this lens, the kit lens might as well be from a DIY pinhole camera. My less than perfect rating is that there is no image stabilization available for the macro lenses. When I'm trying to hone in on bees pollenating a flower, there is a lot of shake. I can't practically use a tripod when the insects are bouncing from bud to bud, so I have to take 100 shots to get one that's not shake blur - and I miss some really cool shots. In addition to the lack of image stabilization, I am frustrated w/ the sometimes unpredictable focusing that will happen as the lens is trying to decide whether it should be focusing at telephoto or macro. I wish there was a switch on the lens to make it macro only or telephoto only, so it wouldn't be bouncing from one focal length to the other all the time. I've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro. The telephoto focal length is a bit long (for those of us who cannot afford a full-frame sensor camera) for most casual photography. I recently used this lens to shoot some promo shots of some massage therapists in a small eatery. I practically had to set up in the restaurant's bathroom to get the photos I wanted, but opted for this lens because it's much faster (2.8) and I wanted to use natural light over flash. The lens is long and heavy for its range. With the addition of the battery pack grip, this lens added on is very weighty, so I may not take it w/ me in my kit bag on every shoot. Once I add another short fixed focal length lens and a moderate telephoto to my kit, my guess is that this lens will be pulled out for only special occasions. It's tack-sharp, but it can be frustrating at times 
This is a fantastic lens not only for Macro shots but for portraits too. Having the extra distance allows for far more flexibility when out and about. Having tried both the 50, 60 and 100mm - I'm glad I went with the 100mm 
This lens is one of my favorites... not only is it an awesome macro lens, it also can easily be used as a portrait lens. The sharpness that I have seen in my macro work has thoroughly pleased me... it ranks right up there with my "L" lenses 
"Wow!" is all I can say to express my reaction after getting prints taken with my 17-40. I've been using Nikon manual-focus Nikkors since 1988 and was always satisfied with the color and sharpness. However, after using the Canon "L" series, I've sold a lot of my Nikkors. The color, clarity, sharpness, and detail of the "L" lenses are amazing. The prints have this 3-D effect (without having to use those silly red/blue glasses!) 8-) Within 3 weeks of receiving my 17-40, I ordered the 70-200. Those two lenses will replace my whole Nikkor collection. Build is really good. The "L" zooms are a little bulkier, but very managable. The Nikkors are smaller, but very heavy. But lense technology and coatings have improved so much in 20 years, I can see the difference. I tested the lens by pointing it toward the sun. The 17-40 surprising handles flare very well. With the sun just outside the field of view, there was very little flare and loss of contrast. I also make 12x18 prints, and this lens handles them easily. The body is going to be the limiting factor (refering to digital bodies). Warning: once you use "L" glass, you are going to be spoiled. You may not settle for consumer lenses anymore, although some non-L lenses are quick good from what I read 
This is my first L lens. As an amateur, this really makes you see the difference in lenses. I use this as a general lens and have basically put away the lens that came in the kit. I am also planning to purchase the 100-400mm IS for better wildlife and family sports photography. Wish it came with a better lens hood. 
The walkaround lens. This very topic leads to a heated discussion among DSLR photographers. First, determine your budget, focal length, and aperture needs. If you frequently find yourself zooming out to get everything in a frame, you will want a wide angle lens such as this. If you frequently find yourself zooming in, this is not the lens for you. On a full frame body such as Canon EOS 5D, this lens becomes ULTRA wide angle. On an APS-C crop body such as Digital Rebel XTi (which I used for this review), it becomes MEDIUM wide angle. But thanks to 1.6x crop factor, this lens expands to more usable 35mm equivalent focal length of 27 to 64mm. Second, audition the lens if you can. By definition, a walkaround lens should be relatively portable. At 1.1 lbs., Canon's EF 17-40mm f/4L USM is neither super light nor neck breakingly heavy. In fact, it weighs almost the same as Digital Rebel XTi -- really nice balance. The lens feels very solid with supreme build quality that only L-series lenses offer. Although this lens is weather proof and therefore sealed against liquid and dust, I strongly recommend getting a 77mm filter to protect the front lens element. With it, this lens is made to last. In terms of looks and feel, it doesn't get much better. Its rubberized full-time inner focus manual ring USM focuses smoothly, quietly, and quickly. Since it's inner focus, the lens will not extend beyond its metal casing whether you zoom in or out. The focus window shows focusing distance from 0.28 meter (0.92 feet) to infinity. The focal length marker indicates 17, 20, 24, 28, 35, and 40mm. The lens exudes quality from tip to tip. You may tolerate heavier lens or may not mind lesser build quality of cheaper lenses. A walkaround lens will be used very often, so make sure you will be comfortable with it. This lens is famous for saturated color and deep contrast. Its images are simply stunning. At 17mm wide angle, barrel distortion is noticeable but relatively mild. From 24mm to 40mm, its images are distortion free and perfectly suited at capturing people. Vignetting (corner darkness) is minimal with mild chroma abberrations (color shadows). At f/4 aperture, details become noticeably softer toward the edges. The center region is very sharp and at f/5.6, edges remain fairy sharp. Thanks to 7 diaphragm blades, this lens can produce very nice bokeh at 40mm (blur effects). One of the most cited weaknesses is the f/4 aperture. In my experience, a bump in the ISO speed and steady hands are all you need to take well focused images indoor. On the other hand, if you are shooting with very little amount of light, you might wish for f/2.8 or image stabilizer. Although the difference between f/4 and f/2.8 is just 1 stop, my other lens, Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM (too heavy to be my walkaround lens) easily outperforms in such challenging situations. But by and large, I was not handicapped by the f/4 aperture. Some of the main competitions (sorted by price): - Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 EX DC: Arguably the best wide angle lens for limited budget. The focus mechanism is a bit slow, corner is very soft, chroma abberrations can be a bit of an issue, and the lens is highly prone to flare. Works only with EF-S mount. - Sigma AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC macro: A bit more expensive than Sigma 18-50mm, but has wider focal range with macro capability. - Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM: This "traveler's lens" has a wider focal range than most wide angle lenses (widest among Canon) and is equipped with an image stabilizer. But the lens is famous for extreme barrel distortion at 17mm and chroma abberrations. Works only with EF-S mount. - Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 Di II LD Aspherical (IF): This is the most direct competitor. It takes sharper images with faster aperture while costing less. Both the build and focus mechanism are significantly worse, but should be good enough for many. Works only with EF-S mount. - Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM: This is THE reference, if you can afford it. Its images have razor sharp details and great performance all around (minus vignetting, which is typical of EF-S lenses). The build quality is worse than L-series but not too shabby. Works only with EF-S mount. This is the best EF-S lens hands down. - Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L USM: One of the most expensive wide angle zoom lenses. It's larger and heavier, but has f/2.8 aperture. This is how Canon EF 17-40mm f/4 USM stacks up. Pros: - Among the very best build quality. - Excellent, buttery smooth, super fast front-focus system. - Top notch color and contrast. Very sharp center resolution. - Almost non-existent vignetting, generally low distortion, and well controlled chroma abberrations. - Ideal weight and size for walkaround purpose Cons: - Edge softness at f/4 aperture. - Narrower focal length than most competing lenses. - Slower than some third party lenses. All in all, this is an excellent wide angle walkaround lens. It may not offer the most bang for the buck, but if you value full frame compatibility (EF lens mount) and excellent build quality, this is the default choice. This lens comes with a nice pouch and a lens hood. I find the hood to be somewhat ridiculously shaped and because the lens is resistant to flare, I do not use it often when shooting outdoor 
This is a great lens. I use it on full-frame film and digital SLRs, and love getting ultrawide shots. However, if you have the cash, you'll probably be happier with the 16-35/2.8 lens, as f4 can be pretty slow indoors 
This lens produces magical images. I am stunned by its sharpness, contrast and color saturation. Simply amazing! This is a great option as a standard zoom for APS-C cameras and a great wide-angle option for full-frame. For APS-C ussers, I have sold my EF-S 17-85 IS USM because this is just miles better. I simply love this lens! I am now so sold on the difference an L makes, that I have also sold my telephoto lens for a 70-200 f4 L. I believe this is a great investment because: * Canon lenses lose very little of their value * Should Canon abandon the APS-C sized sensor for full-frame 35mm, then the EF lens range will make your kit far more future-proof * Once the initial sting of the price has receded, you will never regret the quality of the images you take with this lens Just try it - it's awesome! Some reviewers call this a slow lens - I would disagree. Many zooms are f3.5-5.6, or perhaps f3.5-4.5 in the pro-sumer range. There is virtually nothing between f3.5 and f4, and a constant f-stop is an advantage. f4 is not fast, but it's certainly not slow, either 
I am really glad that I bought this lens. It comes with hood which can be reversed when not in use so it is very useful. Leather pouch, front cap, and back cap is included. Focusing is super fast with USM. 
Having owned the distortion-prone Nikkor AFS 17-35 f2.8D for six years, it was time to switch over to Canon's EF 17-40 mm f4L USM. Canon's version was over a $1000 cheaper, optically superior and lighter in weight. For me, an outstanding standard lens when coupled with the Canon 5D. Vignetting at f4 is minimal. Adobe Photoshop CS2's vignetting tool can correct the vignetting. Distortion at 17mm is minimal. Less than Canon's EF 16-35 mm f2.8L USM set at 16 mm. With the 5D pointed at a blue sky, the EF 17-40 hunted for a focus point while the EF 16-35 didn't. Flaring is minimal when compared to the EF 16-35. Portraits taken at 40 mm produced better results than the EF 16-35 and AFS 17-35 at 35 mm. Images produced at f4 are sharp. At f8, the images are very sharp. This lens is a definite keeper. 
This is a magnificent lens deserving of high praise. In general, I tend to shoot "available light" and towards wide angle, and EF 17-40 F4L is one perfect lens for someone like me. On an APS size sensor camera (mine is Rebel XT), it works approximately like a 28-70 mm zoom--a perfect walk-around lens, giving you decent wide angle and at the tele end, a pleasing perspective on faces you expect from a moderate telephoto. I spent two weeks with EF 17-40 on the coast shooting nature and street stuff in small towns. It performed perfectly. But I only realized what a real treasure I have when I began having second thoughts about it on the eve of a long overseas journey. I asked myself whether I would not have done better buying EF-S 17-85 F4-5.6 IS. After all, it gives you better reach - an equivalent of 28-135 mm zoom on a 35 mm camera. Would it not be a perfect lens on an overseas trip? A dilemma worhty of Hamlet. So I decided to order it from Amazon while I still had time to return EF 17-40. As soon as EF-S 17-85 came, I did some tests taking pictures of still life, flowers and a portrait at similar focal lengths and at full zoom. The results put 17-85 to shame. Color and light were flat and paled next to 17-40. But there was still the problem of reach. I took a portrait at full zoom of the same person (40 mm or 65 mm equivalent and 85 mm or 135 equivalent), cut out the critical focus area from both pix and equalized the two crops in terms of pixel numbers. Unprocessed, 17-85 produced a perfectly focused picture, the 17-40 crop was visibly softer, but in terms of tonality and richness of gradations, it was way ahead of its rival. Photoshop to the rescue! After I fiddled with sharpening and contrast in CS2, the focus softness in 17-40 was gone, and the result was a better all-around picture of the same portrait detail. In other words, if you wish to take a picture, say, of a building's detail or a monkey mug shot in a zoo--a situation calling for a telephoto of 135 mm that 17-85 is capable of--EF 17-40 F4 can do the job, in fact a better job in terms of textures and tonality--and focus, too, if you do a little post-processing in SC2. I am returning EF-S 17-85 and will stick with EF 17-40, taking it on my overseas trip. Unlike EF-S 17-85 F4-5.6, which is a feels like a decent consumer zoom, EF 17-40 F4L is built like a tank and has weather sealing. It should also come in handy if and when I decide to switch to a full-frame camera (EF-S lenses work only with the APS-size sensors). 
May I introduce you to one of the least know and yet most superb lenses Canon makes. You probably even stumbled on to this page by accident, looking for another Canon lens, looking at various macros, or even just intrigued by this higher-priced lens you've probably never even considered. Let me just say this about this lens: Ultra sharp. Ultra colorful. Ultra contrast. Ultra solid. Like everybody else, I initially bought this lens for its macro. The 60mm and 100mm options were a lot cheaper, but my collection is entirely L-class and I'd learned to trust putting gobs of money into the lenses with the red ring. So I put my money where my L-faith is and went with this lens. Needless to say, my faith was rewarded again. Yeah, sure it's got the 1.0x macro capability, and this is important. But what I wasn't expecting was the image quality. It is unbelievably good. Now I'm not somebody who's taking his first trip into L land and comparing this lens to the $300 run-of-the-mill glass. I've used six L-class lenses significantly and I'm comparing this lens' image quality to THOSE. You will find yourself using this lens as much as its 180mm focal length and f/3.5 aperture dictates. The lens is versatile both as a super-fine telephoto and as a 1.0x macro. The macro capability is the main feature. 1.0x macro literally means that a 35mm wide object will completely fill a 35mm frame. Basically, it's a small microscope. If you dare to dial in the aperture to the wide-open f/3.5, the DOF is approximately that of the thickness of two sheets of writing paper at 1.0x. Needless to say, you'll need a tripod, preferably with macro rails that slide forwards and rearwards for ultimate control. (For those of you new to macro, focusing the lens changes the magnification factor. So as one focuses the object, the object's size in the viewfinder changes. This is why I mention the macro rails, they allow you to achieve focus and physically move the lens/camera in and out to reachieve the desired composition.) As a telephoto, due to this lens' superb image quality, it actually produces images of a much greater quality than the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS. (I know firsthand, as I own it too) The difference is in the 70-200mm's versatility. If the light drops too low, the f/2.8 and the IS bests the f/3.5 quite rapidly. If the distance of subjects change quickly or you are unable to move your feet to frame images, the 180mm will be too constricting and the zoom will win. But under conditions where the 180mm f/3.5 can perform unhindered (such as at an airshow or out flower hunting), it will consistantly produce brighter, more saturated, and sharper images than the 70-200mm F/2.8 IS. There is a complaint that circulates about the slow speed at which this lens autofocuses, expecially annoying when trying to be used as a telephoto. This is actually incorrect. The lens' autofocus drive does infact move very quickly, but it must traverse all the way from infinity to about 4" in front of the lens to find the subject. This is where the wait time comes into effect. Here's the solution: utilizing the AF limiter switch allows you to limit the AF search to only between infinity and about 5' in front of the lens. Consequently, this range is about 10% of the focus range (the other 90% is in between that 5' and the 4"). I no longer experience AF "hunting" problems when trying to use the 180mm as a telephoto. Some other info about this lens: The front objective element is actually concave. I think this is the only L lens Canon makes with a concave front element. It's probablyexpensive to replace if an accident should occur, so utilize a UV filter (72mm filter size). I recommend only the B+W or Hoya Multi-coated brands. (Yes they're pricey, but worth it) The hood for this lens is actually a little too small in my opnion. If shooting a backlit object, I sometimes get the heavy orange glow in the viewfinder soI am forced to use my hand as a "hood extender" and block the sunlight. For its size, this lens is relatively lightweight. It is much lighter than the 70-200mm F/2.8L IS and easily handholdable for extended periods of time. This lens is compatible with Canon's extenders. I have personally used it with the 1.4x extender. The results are excellent. While CA and sharpness degrade noticeably on the 70-200mm, this lens shows barely a difference in image quality, except for the change in designation to a 252mm F/5, of course. And add to the fact that the macro capability is now gone from 1.0x to 1.4x, a big bonus. So for whom does this lens apply? -Those who neither have a macro or a telephoto prime who desire a single piece that can handle both aspects with excellent results. -Those who plan on performing professional product photography. -Those that are looking into serious nature photography (packing this lens with a wide-angle is pretty much all you'll need on a day hike). What this lens does not do well: -Low-light photography. -Event photography. -Landscapes. Alternatives: -60mm/100mm: lesser image quality, less telephoto compression in macro images, no real double-duty as a telephoto, but a whole lot cheaper and wider aperture. -MP-E 65mm: much greater magnification (5.0x), lower image quality, no telephoto capability, odd design means studio use almost exclusivel 
When this lens is used with a 1.6X camera body such as the XT, 20D, or 30D it ends up giving you an amazing 288mm Macro or you can go one step further with the 1.4x or 2X TC's and make it a 403/576mm super power. Of course whenever doing this you must either use a tripod or flash except in blazing light. It is a little slow to focus compared to many of the other lenses canon offers, but since you will most likely be using manual focus a lot of the time anyway, this is not a huge drawback. It also gets heavy to carry after a few hours and you will have people ask you questions about both your and their cameras. On a good note parents are pretty good about keeping small children out of your way when you have this lens mounted. The narrower background as compared to the 60mm or 100mm macro lenses makes cluttered areas easier to deal with. The extra working distance is also a plus when working with wary insects etc. It is best to use a shutter release and mirror lockup for shutter speeds longer than 1/30 if you want sharp pictures. The 60mm Macro wins in convenience, but for absolute clarity and improved working distance the 180 comes out on top 
I spend most of my time as a photographer taking macro photographs of flowers and other small things in nature. I chose this lens over Canon's 50mm macro and 100mm macro for two reasons: (1) it is constructed with higher quality UD glass, so it has great color and contrast, and it's incredibly sharp at all f/stops, and (2) at 180mm, it allows you to stay farther away from your subjects and still focus to 1:1. This makes it easier take photographs without disturbing your subjects and it allows you to have a smaller, more blurry area in the background so that the background doesn't compete with the subject for attention. The lens also comes with a tripod color, which allows you conveniently change from vertical to horizontal, and it adds stability with your lens better balanced on your tripod. The lens has an ultrasonic motor, so it's fast and quiet when focusing, though I highly recommend setting the focus limiter 1.5m-infinity when not shooting macro photography. It will speed up the time it takes for the lens to focus. The only drawback I can find with the lens is that it is constructed with only an 8 blade aperture diaphram. Theoretically, with a higher number of blades, it would allow more natural blurs, but I can say I've never noticed a problem in my photographs 
I have seen glowing reports on this lens in several magazines, most notably in Shutterbug. It is truly a splendid performer and one well worth paying for if a photographer needs the extra working distance afforded by a macro lens in the 180mm to 200mm range. Its performance is certainly as good, if not better, than Nikon's venerable 200mm f4 Micro Nikkor, which was one of the first - if not the first - telephoto macro lenses in this focal length. This Canon lens excels not only in macro photography but also in nature photography, getting close-up images of animals in the wild without working too close to disturb them. If I owned Canon equipment, then this lens would be an essential part of my kit 
There is nothing like a telephoto to bring boats at anchor up close when you're halfway up a mountain. I got a great shot in Tahiti just that way with just this lense and a friend of mine used it on the cover of her romance novel. It's true the lense is heavy. Canon says it weighs 1.7 pounds, but it seems heavier. No matter though, because you won't have to go to the gym if you heft this baby around for awhile, and as a side benifit, you'll get crisper, sharper photos then you would with any other 200mm out there today. Just think of it as body building and photo shooting both at the same time. Also this one won't break your wallet. Serously, this is one darned fine piece of glass, you just simply cannot go wrong with a Canon "L" lense, just can't Jack Priest, Sailor Home from the Se 
Canon L lenses are known for their great optics and priceyness. This fast tele is an excellent value. The only thing that would improve this lens would be the addition of the image stabilizion feature found on a few Canon optics. Of course, the advantage of large aperature lenses is that you can set a fast shutter speed and still have enough light for a shot. This lens is surprisingly compact, (as long focal length teles go). The autofocus is very fast and quiet. Comes with a hood, too.  
The product is a top quality product. The filters work excellent with my Canon Powershot S2. Without a doubt, worth every penny, especially considering the price I paid for it, which was at least half of where I saw it listed at other places. Very happy with the purchase 
The filters that I got are poorly finished. The 812 filter has a smudge on it, while all 3 filters don't screw on properly on my lens. All filters come off EASILY. They are totally useless. I suggest that you buy filters in a real store so you can try them on your lens 
This set of basic filters is a must have for every camera bag...even new SLR users will find them easy to use and they will enhance your pictures - without a doubt 
The backpack holds all my stuff with extra room. The only thing was that I thought I was ordering a bag not a backpack based on the picture shown. The backpack is a little on the heavy side for me but I do like it 
This bag easily accomodates my new Canon S3 IS, along with the lens adapter and hood, with room to spare. Recently, during a trip to Europe, I was also able to fit several other items into the bag: the rechargeable battery charger, AC adapter, and outlet adapter, along with two sets of rechargeable batteries, as well as a UV filter, and I still had room for more. I've no doubt the wide- and tele-converters for this camera would also have fit, with room to spare 
If you are at the intermediate level with photography and need a camera bag that is strong and comfortable this bag may be for you. I can fit my canon s2is, adapter, two filters or a lens in this bag. This is all I expected from what I read about this product. If you have a SLR with multiple lenses,,, sorry,,, you will have to spend more bucks for a bigger bag. 
Absolutely love this camera bag! I hate dealing with a purse and camera bag while traveling, so I just carry this bag. Everything I need (wallet, cell phone, car keys chap stick) plus all the camera equipment fit just fine in this bag. You can't go wrong with this. My husband will even hold it for me since it's not a purse! 
I've had many camera bags over the years, and this one seems to fit the bill the best. It is roomy - carries camera body and one lens, plus charger, extra batteries, manual, memory card, and has room for another lens or two. I wouldn't say it would be able to hold more than three lenses. We recently took this on a trip to St. Lucia and it held up well, even repelling some unexpected rain. We were very pleased. The size is perfect - roomy but not overly bulky. I'd highly recommend this bag! 
I love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it. The product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at. The S2 IS is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags. This bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries, chargers and extra media cards. There is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot. The correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens. Given that limitation, this is a great bag. The bag is very well made and holds my Canon Powershot S2 IS very securely. I lay the camera on it's back and that means that even if I accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly. The material is great and the waist belt is very practical. The strap is well padded and after a day of use I believe it is one of the most comfortable straps I have used. Buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it. 
I would have rated this bag with ***** if it would have been a little bit larger. It will fit only a SLR camera with its lens on. No aditional space. Actually, there are some good spots to keep your extra flash cards, you extra battery and charger. So, if you want to move around with your SLR with at least two lenses, get a bigger one 
This bag is small, but it fits my Canon Rebel XT with the kit lens and battery grip. I also carry the 50mm/1.7 lens in there and still have room for the manual, battery charger and other small components. I will be getting a bigger bag when I start acquiring more lenses, but it is great for now and for summer travel. It also looks nice and is very sturdy 
First of all it took me a few months to decide on what lens to buy because I did so much research. My choices were between Canon 70-200L 4, 70-200L 2.8 and the 70-200L 2.8IS. After much investigation I opted not to buy the 4.0 because I knew that I would be shooting in dim lights and needed the 2.8. So to save money I bought the 2.8 NON IS. The lens is great and I travelled to Utah with it. All was great until I tried to shoot a deer at full zoom. Every one came out blurry and could not use. Apart from that it is a fantastic lens. As a result I decided to fork out for the 2.8 IS lens and it is amaizing. It has the same optics as the non IS but handheld the IS really works great. Like on some of the reviews it does not make every shot in focus but certainly most of them and the picture quality is amaizing. Fast focus, great colours. Fantastic. If you can afford it buy it and the IS is def worth it because the lens is heavy and you do shake a bit, which is noticeable at full or close to full zoom. Hope this helps 
It's a bit heavy but a superb lens. Interior construction has quite a bit of plastic however which is a bit of a concern. I've dropped one onto hard packed dirt/soccer field w/no damage...so it's pretty sturdy :) If you can live with 1 stop less light consider the newly released 70-200 f/4 L IS. This is the new 70-200 f/4 with IS from Canon and will save you some weight if that is a concern 
Had the 70-200 f/4 and loved it to pieces with a D60, and now with a 1D MKII, but sold the 4.0 in order to pay for a 35-350, which is my work horse. Due to the push and pull feature however, the 35-350 gets dusty quick in good ol' Montana land, so it has to go in for cleanings every once in a while, and the f/stop isn't always desirable for certain situations. The 70-200 F/2.8 is amazing. The twist zoom is a little close to the camera, so it takes some twisting of the wrist to get it where you need it, and IMHO, is a bit too much of a turn to be from 70 to 200 in the time one might need for extreme sports. (Rodeo, NASCAR etc) The clarity of this piece of glass just blew me away. I did a comparison of images from my 70-200 F/4 when it was new, and the 2.8 is still visibly sharper. I put an expensive filter on it, as my equipment is asked a lot of in very harmful conditions, and I do notice the slightest big of distortion with a filter, even though it is a good B so when I can, I shoot the lens with no filter if I require extreme detail. The 35-350L is nowhere near the quality of this little 2.8... if it weren't for the difference in distance, this lens would be my one and only. Oh, and I love the IS. As it is my first IS Lens, I treasure is, but know I will not buy another distance lens without it 
You know, I researched this lens again and again. I put it on my Christmas list. A year and a half went by and I finally just bought it. My gosh, everything is true! This is one of the world's great lenses. What a piece of glass. With the image stabilization I can take candid shots in a candlelit restaurant using available light. The lens is magical. It captures the soul of its subjects. Nature photography is phenomenal. This is an incredible tool that will take you to a new level. Just do it! No regrets. Honest. 
I use this gem on my 20D along with my 24-105mm, and as far as I'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there. My 24-105 isn't the ideal indoor/low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens( although it is sharp, just not quite long enough) The 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with IS to boot! The photos I've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers. If you can afford it, do it, you won't regret i 
I spent alot of time evaluating this product. Finally after reading the reviews I dug deep and spent the extra dollars to get this lense. It has been a wounderful addition to my Canon Reble. It is a very high quality product that is easy to use and delivers beautiful shot every time. 
Pros: Superb Retention of Color, bokeh (background blur), sharpness. Fast silent and accurate autofocus. Great Build quality. Cons: Size, weight and price. Not your everyday walkaround lens. Expensive. 
I had read the reviews on this lens and no one had anything bad to say about it. It is fast, crisp, focuses fast, quiet, solid and a bit heavy. The weight is vastly compensated for by all of the positive features. I have used it on my 20D and was just amazed. I just purchased a 5D and cannot believe my eyes. Just a great great lens 
I got this lens with my 300D (Digital Rebel) kit and have enjoyed it ever since. Solid, durable, reliable, good in most light situations. Lots of success in wide-angle landscape photos. I'm typically using this at the 18mm end and it's produced beautiful images, especially at sunset and indoors with flash. Also very light and small, I just toss it in my bag and I'm set. Pretty decent for close-up stuff as well like flowers, etc. Overall it's a good starter lens if you're getting it with a kit, but you could probably grab it used for $60 I would guess if you're just looking for a good all-around lens 
I am a portrait professional photographer for over 40 years. I needed a wide angle lens for weddings and wanted to know the quality of the kit lens. I did a test using the Rebel XT kit lens and a Canon 16-35mm lens which costs somewhere around $1,500. I set both cameras at 18mm focal length on a tripod. I took shots outdoors and indoors. The images were done exactly the same. The outdoor shots show objects at infinity as well as 10' away. I made 8x10 prints and showed them to my fellow professional photographers. Nobody could identify which lens took which. This is a real world scenario 
This lens is great for those indoor regular nothing fancy shots. I recently used mine indoors at a restaurant and the distance or close up range was perfect. 
First thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying. The kit lens comes with Canon 20D, 30D, 300D, or XT is the lower version, non USM one. On the higher version USM ones, you will see the red color "USM" at the front of the lens. According to the reviews, compare with the non USM ones, optically they are the same. However, the USM motor does focus faster and much quieter. People complain about the build quality. Actually I feel that it is really not that bad, much better than the Canon 50mm f1.8 II. The USM auto focus performance is fast, never hunt, and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 II. It fits nicely on the XT. Do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more. We have to compare apple to apple. If you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely, the images will come out nicely. 1. This is not the lens for indoors low light conditions. If you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed, go get a different lens. (For example, I use a Canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation.) 2. The distortion on 18mm is quite a bit. Avoid taking strait lines (like buildings) pictures on the edge while wide open. However, this can be easily corrected on computers. 3. Step down the aperture to F8 or F11, the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners. Overall, the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens. It is very light weight and highly portable while traveling. This fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens. 
Many people think this is the kit lens. It is not! The numbers do match, but the kit lens is not USM and worth about 1/2 the price. Go to the Canon web site and take a look at the Lens Chart. This lens is much faster and has better glass than the kit lens. 
Let's be honest... a "kit lens" that adds approximately $70 to the overall price of a camera body is not supposed to be Canon L-series quality. Sure, you can find a better quality lens, but not for $70 you can't! I plan to use this lens as a knock around lens that allows me to get more familiar with my camera and run off some shots. Personally (and this is a personal preference), I find that I tend to want to be closer to subjects anyway - with the 1.6x factor on the Rebel XT, I'm in great shape with some of my other lenses. If you don't happen to already have a super wide lens in your arsenal, and you are getting a digital EOS with the 1.6x magnification factor, then buy this lens. Please don't let some of the other "lens snobs" sway you - a few of which are actually "posers" that snap less than 500 pix per year and spend more time looking at the technical aspects of the picture instead of its true artistic value. I can hear them now.. "it isn't contrasty enough", "the barrel distortion is horrible at the wide end", "pin cushion is significant"... I say BAH!! Are these statements true... sure they are... to a degree. But let's remember that not everyone can afford to be as picky. Buy the lens, load the camera with a fresh battery and a blank memory card and GET OUT THERE!! If you find yourself shooting at the wide end often, THEN sell/give this lens to a colleague and go in search of another (higher quality) lens... very little lost. Enjoy yourselves and take lots of pictures... good luck 
This is the standard kit lens that comes with the Rebel and 20D. This lens is most definitely built to a budget. And does it ever show! Completely inexcusable is the lack of numbering of ANY kind on the focusing ring. This is VERY frustrating when it comes to taking pictures of distant objects, since you cannot simply set it to infinity. Also, because it goes into macro mode beyond infinity, you cannot simply crank it all the way to one side! Of course, you can always use the autofocus if you wish. But this doesn't work for night photography. In fact, you might as well forget about doing ANY night photography with this lens due to the inability to focus it based on estimation of distance (and the fact that the autofocus doesn't work in the dark). Besides this nagging problem, the lens just is not very sharp. When I first got my Rebel, I was VERY impressed with the pictures it took, since all I had to compare it to were pictures taken by point-and-shoots. But after taking several hundred pictures with it, I find that in most cases, the pictures are VERY much on the soft side. This is a particular problem with distant objects. Even when focused on those distant objects, they never appear really sharp, although objects of intermediate distance (~100ft) seem to be okay. Let's face it. This lens just doesn't have it. Unless you are REALLY hard up for cash, steer clear 
I chose to purchase this lens over the standard 18-55 that comes with the kit XT. It functions smoothly and seems to be worth the difference and is definitely an upgrade. 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
Compare to the Price of the product I highly recommend to any one who own Canon EOS camera... 
This lens is a must have for all beginner photographers. Excellent sharpness and a really fast lens. I know I've heard many complain about the cheap feel of it but at less than $100 you can't beat it. Yes it does have a plastic mount, yes the focus ring is small but the quality of it's pictures and price make it a definite winner until you decide to move up to the much higher priced L's. 
I purchased this lense for the novelty of having an inexpensive 1.8 lense. I use this in low light sport situations like basketball or volleyball - and especially gymnastics where flash is not allowed. I'm not a huge fan of being locked into a focal length, but for anything under 2.8 you don't have a choice. This is definitely not a primary lense for indoor sport shooting, but it's a fun companion when you need the speed of a 1.8 indoors 
This lens takes very sharp pics. Works great in low light. A true value for the price 
Awesome lens, especially for the price. It's very fast and 50mm even at 1.6x mag of my Rebel XT is easily manageable 
This is a good prime lens, although not perfect for the Rebel XT. Sharp throughout most of the range, and good for low-light shots. Overall, a solid buy 
I had no investment in a DSLR but narrowed my choices to the Canon 30D and the Nikon D200. I had always wanted a Nikon. The D200 is definitely a joy to hold and it did take good pictures (I tried both at a camera store before I bought the 30D). I did a lot of research (more than I care to admit!) and there was no conclusive evidence that one camera had a clear edge over the other. Depending on your specific needs, one camera may be "slightly better" than the other. After trying out both cameras, I was convinced the 30D was as good a fit for my needs as the D200. For "value for money" the 30D was a clear winner over the D200 (I got mine when Canon had the Cash in with Canon promotion going). Also, as a beginner to SLR I found the 30D with its fully automatic and scene modes easy to start out with. I don't expect to use the scene modes or the full auto mode after a week or two. I expect to quickly graduate to the creative control zones. But to use as a family camera, the quick scene modes are very helpful. If you expect to use it more on a professional basis it'd probably not matter. Additionally, when I checked it out at the store, I noticed the Canon 30D focused sharply almost every time. The D200 did not at least a few times. I'd take this with a grain of salt though since it was a brief trial at a store. But I thought I'd share my experience. It may have just been an anomaly with the actual equipment I tried out. Do I still find the Nikon D200 to be a great camera? Absolutely! Do I regret having bought a Canon 30D? Absolutely not! The decision swinger in my case was really the "money factor". I was more than willing to spend up to $300 more for the Nikon D200. But when the difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable for my Christmas gift to myself:-) My purchases included the Canon 30D [...], Canon 17-85mm EF-S IS USM lens [...], and a SanDisk Extreme III 2GB compact flash card [...] I plan to add an external flash to this soon, and will consider eventual lenses after I determine that the camera is a long-term keeper. 
My 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera cannot keep up with him. And I also don't like the washout look when I uses flash. So I researched about which SLR will best meet my needs, mainly catching fast action, candid moments and low light photos without flash. The Canon 30D comes up top on the list. It has the best high ISO performance in its class (better than Nikon and Sony). And when I combine the 30D with the fast zoom lens EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS, the result is amazing. I can stop any action in daylight, capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode, and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod. Portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background (bokeh). Even the dimly-lit decors of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion came out superb when we went there for the Halloween party at night, without flash or tripod. This is really an important factor for me to buy this camera, as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old. But you will need a good lens to make this work well. If you use a cheap kit lens, then it will probably not matter which camera you pick. Remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens (not the kit lens)and crop the pictures to magnify the details. The Sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and don't need low light performance (use flash and save money). The Nikon has more custom function than Canon, and it is really as good as Canon. They both have their strength and weakness. Canon just happens to have slightly better high ISO performance and that suits my need better than Nikon. To be fair, I should mention that the Nikon D200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year, beating the Canon 30D overall. But the D200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me, better suits someone more serious about photography. The D80 is like a "mini" D200, but slower. So it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend. Shooting in low light without flash will need good high ISO performance, a good fast lens (with wide aperture, usually expensive), and image stabilization. If that's what you want, the Canon 30D with the EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS will not disappoint you 
I compared a number of pro-sumer cameras and became firmly convinced this was the best camera for the money. Although Nikon at one time was considered the premier camera for the professional, they now take second stage to Canon not only for engineering, but for the quality of the lens, innovative and user-friendly design, and overall quality. I have used the camera for approximately one month and have been delighted. Having talken pictures for over 35 years - including professional - and always using Minolta equipment for all of those years, I am truly enamored with this Canon camera 
I am so pleased with this camera! There's really nothing negative I can think to say about it! I also own the Cannon XT. I use both for wedding photography as well as family portraits and I am so impressed with the color quality of the D30! Well done CANNON 
This camera is incredible. I ordered it for my husbands birthday and he is just begining to figure it all out. There are so many great features. One of the best is how quickly you can take digital pictures. Our other digital cameras have a lag time between shots, but not this one. The pictures are crisp and it is easy for even a novice like me to use. I highly recommend this camera if you want to take digital photography to the next level. It is one of the best 
This can be a very easy to use camera. Simply by using the auto mode and composing your pictures properly you can get very good JPEG images. It also can be about as complicated as you want to make it. It has many advanced features on it. I have been shooting 35mm for about 32 years. My most recent before this one being an Elan II E about 7 years ago. It's still working also. The 30d is my first digital and I absolutely love the camera. I generally work in the aperture priority mode with a tripod at 100 ISO when shooting landscape. But, the camera is very capable in auto mode as well without the tripod. I like to shoot RAW so that I can tweek things a bit, but the JPEG images are very acceptable. It also works extremely well for portraits. It actually is better than the 35mm to me because it has very low noise even at higher ISOs. 1600 looks about like 800 film to me. This is a very good value for the money in my opinion 
For those who truly know digital cameras, having more than perhaps 8 megapixels is important only if you plan on blowing your images up to "poster size", or if you are a pro who knows how to use all those pixels. And truthfully, how many of you really plan to do that type of stuff? To say that the Rebel XTi is better than the 30D because it "has more megapixels" and is "smaller" is not the best advice. Any Canon DSLR is going to give you great images, if know how to use it. For those of you who are trying to decide which camera to buy, you really need to go to a camera store and ask to handle each camera. While you're at it, ask yourself how it feels in your hands. Is it too bulky? Is it too small and hard to handle? Does it have the features you want such as spot metering, which the Rebel XTi does not have? The 30D is a terrific DSLR. It has all the features 99% of us need. There is a reason why it costs more than the Rebel. The 30D is a better camera overall. 
Good fit, works as advertised, stores on lens. Helps keep night dew off the lens as well as unwanted light out during the day 
Pros: - Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element. - Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile 
I was really pleased with my item! Amazon shipped in phenomenal packaging! thanks... 
Excellent product works well. Made for the Canon EF28-135mm Lense. Reasonable price 
It's a 72mm lens hood, no vigneting, works great. A must for using EF28-135 outdoors 
I bought this battery for a Canon 30D and can take around a thousand pic's on one charge. Very happy with the battery's performance 
I bought a generic Chinese "equivalent" bp-511 battery that boasted a higher milliamperage rating and a cheaper price than the original Canon battery that came with my camera. The battery worked fine for about 3 months and now only holds a charge for about 20 minutes. I have had it fail at critical times. Never ever buy some knock-off Chinese battery--read the reviews. The Chinese push out their crappy knock-offs to unsuspecting consumers (like I was) just to make a quick buck. Also, don't trust the glowing reviews from the generic sellers. They are self-generated. In my case, the seller is no longer selling under his original company name. He has a new name with the requisite (sham) glowing reviews. CHINESE PRODUCTS SUCK 
Last battery was good for almost 5 years. Easily rechargeable. Couldn't ask for more 
Okay, a lot can be said for saving money, however there can be problems with no-name or non-branded products. No matter what your "style" of photography, you will have a battery empty its charge at a critical moment. Having a back-up is essential. Having a quality back-up battery that will get you through is imperative. Knock-off brands do not hold the same charge as the branded battery meant for your camera; although their manufacture may claim it does. Get in the zone and get the shot! 
This is a replacement for an identical battery pack that I lost. Works great, long life, no problems 
For some reason, Canon- branded batteries are better than those sold by actual battery manufacturers. Don't just look at the $$/mAh ratio, consider safety, reliability and longevity. In these categories, the Canons rock. I bought a G1 camera about five years ago, and the camera is toast, but the battery still works like a charm in my 20D. Others start out with 1400 or even 1700 mAh, but fail after six months - read the reviews here on Amazon.com 
There are many after market batteries for this camera and every review indicates they are not effective, This OEM battery by Sony delivers the goods, with extremely long lasting power to handle not only the digital picture taking but all the additional flash requirements 
I started looking for the earlier version of this flash and when I saw the upgrades on the 430EX I didn't hesitate to order it. It's what I've needed to take my photos to a higher level. I shoot for two magazines and now instead of taking my studio light into every shoot, I still carry it with me, I use this flash instead and it makes a world of difference 
I purchased this along with my new Canon 30D DSLR. I mainly use it for fills in outside sunny days, but it has been used to light up the situation. I'm personally still learning about how to best angle the light to get the best outcome, but I don't think it'll take long 
Excellent addition for Rebel XT. Tried lower cost generic flash units. My only regret is that I waited so long to get the 430EX 
I'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power. It's compact, not heavy, has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right. In addition to the light output, the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced, an excellent feature. Getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because I am totally "brochure reading averse." Twenty years ago I was a photographer with big equipment, but had given up both. I was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit 
This is a very nice flash unit that integrates well with the PowerShot Pro1 camera. I appreciate the zooming strobe tube to match the lens focal length as well as the ability to bounce the flash off the ceiling for softer effects. I should have purchased this flash when I first got the Pro1 camera 
Does the job and the Canon E-TTL II is a nice feature but I wish they would provide a battery indicator like on the Canon DSLR cameras 
I am very pleased with this product... Shoots well in all types of different light conditions, even when it is pitch black the 430EX takes a decent shot at close range... 430EX adds a deeper color and warmth to pictures in conditions where light is lacking... I am a graphic designer and need great photo's when I begin work and the 430EX helps with the process of a more clear and colorful photo when shooting with my Rebel EOS XT Digital Camera... 
This is a great unit. Works great for the purpose for which it was made. I'm going to eventually get the 580 so I can use it as a slave unit (with the wireless option) for a wraparound lighting system. I would recommend a diffuser so that the light can be subdued especially when you wish to brighten the fleshtones of the people in the photo with golden light so they are presented in their best image. Blue spectrum light does not present us in the best way 
An excellent flash to use with my Canon 20D at a fantastic price, the Canon 580ex was an expensive option, but should I buy one in the future ? the 430ex is perfect as a slave unit. Great product from Canon as always 
it works great, there are just two issues. when you lock it on the hot shoe, it can be very, very difficult to unlock (you twist a wheel to tighten it on) and when the batteries in my camera are low, the camera and the flash start having computer problems and act very strange (i have a cannon digital rebel xt). other than those towo issues, which in comparison seem very small to me, the flash is fantastic! lightweight and easy to use 
This great lens is a joy to use.... Keep in mind the min on 1:6 sensors will be about 160mm so you are limited in that respect. Would be nice if you could see lens IS settings like focus range preset in view finder. Don't like the fact that the lens hood does not have a mark to show where it can be installed quickly.. not bad using the logo as indicator for normal use, but always have problems putting it back on reversed to put away. Other hoods have a small dot etc to help line it up. This lens with grip double batteries will get your attention after a days shooting with it. The GOOD news... when you take it off you feel you have a pocket camera weight. I posted some action/panning shots for this lens as there didn't seem to be any others. A couple of aircraft and a couple of auto racin 
This lens is amazing. Nothing escapes it. It's like a black hole. Clearly the best lens I have ever owned. It's like the lidless Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings. It is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera. It comes with a beautiful case, a hood, and a tripod mount on the lens. Believe me you will need it. I took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great. I will now get to work reading the small manual. It has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings. Wow! 
I was using my new Canon lens during the 4th of july Rodeo in Redlodge Montana. Although I was pretty far from of the bull and horse riders gate, all my photos were sharp and no blur at al 
If you use this lens on a 1.6X camera body such as the XT, 20D, or 30D you end up with a 160-640mm equivalent which is an impressive range by any standard. You can also add the 1.4X TC for a 896mm upper limit or the 2X TC for an amazing 1280mm. Of course this comes at a price, and I'm not just talking money. You will have to use a tripod, cable release, and mirror lockup a lot of the time when using such long focal lengths. Plus this thing is very heavy and very large and people will take notice. So if stealth photography is your goal, go with something like the 70-300 DO. That being said, this is an amazing lens, admittedly a little slow near the long end, but to get down to f/4 would have most likely doubled or tripled the price and weight, so it seems like an acceptable trade-off. If you want sharp pictures, an amazing zoom range, and a good workout, but don't mind being the center of attention, this is the lens for you 
I agree with all the others comments about this lens. It works great but it is big, heavy and attracts attention. When I say it attracts attention, I am not kidding. I was at an airshow taking pictures along with a lot of other amature photographers. My 100-400mm lens, however, attracted the attention of a local newpaper reporter who interviewed me. However, I bought it to use with my 20D at airshows and I can honestly say I am not disapointed. It was well worth the money. I also bought a cheap Kenko 1.5x teleconverter for kicks. While the converter isn't "L" grade, I am pleased with the results and the autofocus still works which I understand is not the case with the Canon TCs. For those looking for a big zoom lens and you want IS, you are ulitimately going to wind up buying this lens. 
I've only had this lens for a few days and I will say it has impressed me. It does have drawbacks, needs lots of light and is somewhat heavy. I would not like to carry all day,but for my need it isn't a problem. I have a couple of photos on display taken the first day I purchased the lens . It was a very overcast day and I think they turned out reasonable for the weather. My test at home when the sun popped out were outstanding. As for the push and pull adjustment I see no problem with it. I think with a little more experience it will be a very good purchase for my budget. I know there are higher quality lens but price becomes an issue,when you are a amature hobbiest like I am. I would recommend for any one who likes to take wildlife photos. The 5 star rating is for the money and quality it is a very good lens!   
This lens is super-sharp, colors come out vibrant, it has two IS modes, and is push/pull (some people don't like that, but your zooms are super-fast). This is probably the best Canon telephoto lens in terms of focal range. One bit of warning; it's not only fairly large and made of metal (not plastic), but it's kind of heavy -- while it doesn't weigh 50 pounds, be aware that it's NOT light. Carrying it around when attached to the camera, you carry the equipment by the lens, not the body 
I shoot with a Canon 20D and have used the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 III USM lens. I've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball. I reviewed the lens lineup at the Canon website and decided on the Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L USM Lens. Even so, I was apprehensive about the push/pull zoom system. Since this lens seems so expensive, I wanted to try it before I bought it. After renting the lens and using it over a weekend at a softball tournament, I knew this was the right lens for me. This is a serious lens meant for serious photographers. Being an L lens, there is a lot more features and is manufactured with better materials. The construction is sturdy and consists of 17 elements in 14 groups. The fluorite and Super UD-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum. This lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x II and 2x II. The Canon EF 100-400mm lens weighs in at about 3 lbs/1,380g, and accepts 77mm filters. Be sure to get a good quality UV haze filter. Being white, this lens looks a bit strange, but helps keep it cool when using in the sun. Some people are concerned that being white, it attracts attention to criminals. From my experience, my 20D attracts attention regardless of what lens I put on it. I personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload. I try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up. The dual IS system has two modes. Mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects. It is recommended that the IS function is not used on a tripod; however I have used it on my monopod with success. The IS helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle. While there are limitations to what the IS can do, it can give you a couple extra stops. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed. This lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. There is also a switch to shift from a 1.8m/5.9ft to infinity or 6.5m/21.3ft to infinity. Zooming with this lens takes a little time to get used to if you have never used it before. Once it is gotten used to, it seems to be much faster than the typical twist zooming. A resistance ring is used to tighten or loosen the resistance to zooming. This allows for practically locking the zoom in place or providing no resistance at all. Zooming is as simple as pulling or pushing the lens as its name suggest. The push/pull system causes air to be noticeably pushed around. Because air is pushed into the camera, there is a myth that the lens causes dust to settle and accumulate on digital camera sensors. I mostly use this lens in one of the dirtiest environments I shoot in for amateur softball pictures. Even so, my experience does not support the myth. I have not seen any evidence to support the myth from any reputable source either. Included with this lens are the Tripod mount, lens hood, and storage case. The tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod. This helps to balance the load. Mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over. The case is a zippered soft case (LZ1234) that can also be purchased separately. The lens hood (ET-83C) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations. The Canon EF 100-400mm is such an awesome lens, it almost fails to compare to the Canon EF 75-300mm. The clarity and sharpness is incredible. The auto-focus is quiet and quick. The features add creative versatility. The Canon EF 100-400mm comes at a price, but it is worth every bit of it. Now that I have both lenses, the Canon EF 75-300mm is no longer used. PROS: Incredible clarity and sharpness Quiet and quick auto-focus Features add creative versatility Dual IS system CONS: Heavy and bulky (This should be expected with these types of lenses 
Reviews of this lens on the web are mixed with some showing soft results, particularly at 400mm. This is likely due to wide variations in sample lenses. I decided to take a chance and seem to have gotten lucky. My copy, just received from Amazon (Build date of Oct 2005) produces fantastically crisp and contrasty images on my 20D at ALL focal lengths from 100 to 400. It's almost magical. The images are much sharper using the same f-stops than those from a 70-200 f2.8IS lens at 100-150mm and virtually the same at 200mm. Even wide-open at 400mm this lens is quite sharp. At 400mm, I've compared to a very nice Canon 400mm f5.6L prime lens, with and without 1.4X teleconverter. The images have virtually the same extreme sharpness and contrast if the zoom is stopped down just one one-third stop (e.g. zoom at 6.3, prime at 5.6). With the 1.4X TC both lenses had to be manually focused but produced outstanding clarity with NO perceivable loss in quality. The focus is swift and true and the IS on this lens really works (and does not hum like that on the 70-200 f2.8IS) allowing handheld shots at 1/100 sec at 400mm. It may be that Canon has quietly improved this lens since recent reviews seem to be much more positive than those from a few years ago. Some folks don't like the push-pull zoom but it works great for me and allows very fast composition of scenes. The lens is about the same size as the 70-200 f2.8 IS but seems lighter and better balanced. Given the razor sharpness of its images and 100-400mm range, this seems like the perfect single lens solution for nature and bird photography. However, it is big and white so it may not be the best for candid people photography. 
I bought this lense recently. At first I thought it was heavy, but once I got used to it, I decided that it was heavy due to quality. It is a big lense, and the tripod mount is very useful, especially for balance. You can't but notice the quality of this lense. The IS function is very useful. Combine this lense with the 2x Extender, and you've effectively got a 800mm lense. For anyone looking for a zoom lense, this is one to seriously consider. For sport, the IS function is brilliant, for wildlife ... well, I can go on and on about how good this lense is. Bottom line - well worth buying 
I have been very happy with this camera bag. The slingshot design works well and makes unloading the equipment far less cumbersome than a traditional backpack. I also like the features of the bag. It has all the great Lowepro niceties like a protective sewn-in cloth to cover the sensitive camera viewer before you zip it up, the waterproof covering for that unexpected downpour and compartments for the digital memory cards. It's a good buy 
I purchased the Lowepro Slingshot 200 to replace the Tamrac Adventure 7 backpack I recently returned to Amazon. I spent quite a few hours researching bags to use for sightseeing/hiking and had initially purchased the Tamrac bag b/c of its similarity (in style) to a regular backpack. A recent "L series" purchase has encouraged me to keep a low profile when transporting my gear. While the Tamrac bag certainly looked the part, its functionality left something to be desired. The Adventure 7 held my entire kit, which includes: Canon Digital Rebel XT, EF24-105mm "L", EF50mm EF18-55mm "kit" lenses, EX580 flashgun and the various hoods/filter/etc for the above lenses. Now the bad part, once strapped into its normal position, the only way to access your gear (in the Adven. 7 pack) is to fully remove the backpack, place it on the ground, unzip the zipper fully, then remove/replace the camera/gear you desire. This proved VERY cumbersome while on the rocky terrain of the "Great Falls" national park in VA (near DC), in fact, there were times when I gave up on a few nice photo opportunities simply b/c getting to the camera would have been too difficult. I do own a Lowepro holster, but by going that route, I would have limited my ability to bring alternate lenses/accessories. After some additional research, I decided to try the Slingshot 200. Let's compare the tow on some key points: Gear Capacity: Nearly identical for both bags Additional Capacity: The Tamrac trumps the Lowepro, it has nearly double the useable storage capacity, great for bringing along a snack, your keys, etc. Styling: Again, the Tamrac is a winner, looks like a standard backpack, versus the strange look of the slingshot Functionality: As a backpack, the Tamrac is much more comfortable, has greater storage capacity and even offers a waist support strap for longer trips. BUT, this comes at the cost of accessibility. The Lowepro slides easily around to the front. Simply unzip and your camera is right there. It also is a stable platform for lens changing/cleaning/etc. To summarize: For hiking/walking/etc where you need instant access to your camera and accessories, the Lowepro Slingshot 200 wins hands down. Pros: Instant access to your gear, includes all-weather cover (attached), nice attention to details (lens cleaning/protection cloth is a particularly nice touch), etc. Cons: Strange styling, not reversible (can only be worn on right shoulder), nearly impossible to carry hanging on one shoulder. 
I think I may have found the perfect camera bag. This one is comfortable to wear all day, it holds my Alpha 100 with my kit lens, my 100-400 lens both with lens hoods. My battery charger, manual, misc cables, wallet, phone, misc items such as a small rain jacket. It also has a little pocket for your memory cards. The best part of this bag is that you can swing it around to the front and pull your camera out without having to sit it down or showing everything you have in the bag. The bag is plain enough that most people wouldn't know that you have a camera and all of the equipment that goes with it. Which is a big plus with a women traveling alone 
This bag is very spacious and stylish. It holds my Rebel XT and my three lenses very well. I can even hold a 70-200mm f/4 in there, although it is a bit snug. The best part of this bag is that it is completely customizable. I have set it up in such a way that I can get to any one of my lenses just by slinging the bag around and unzipping only the top compartment. This is very useful when you don't want to constantly set your bag on the floor to access your equipment. I do have one complaint. When wearing this bag as a sling, it will sit on your right shoulder. I am more used to bags sitting on my left shoulder, so that does take some getting used to. When I carry this in "non-sling" mode (i.e. not over my head), it can comfortably sit on my left shoulder. However, the best and most unique feature of this bag is the ability for it to sling around and have access to the camera without taking the bag off, which is only possible if I wear it as a sling bag on my right shoulder. It would have been nice if that portion of the bag is customizable as well 
This thing is perfect for carrying your stuff around in a not-so-fattening way. I hvae an external flash, macro kit, 28-80 lens, 50mm lens, 18-55mm lens, DSLR w/batt grip and 75-300mm lens ATTACHED all fit into the main body of this thing. Everything is seperated by the dividers making me feel confident and safe while walking, hiking, biking, etc. The addon pouches seem to make it a bit more bulking that you'd want, but the bag all by itself is fantastic and I can't recommend it enough - get away from huge bulky shoulder bags!! Lowepro did it again 
Great product. Compact, easy to use (took a couple of trys), feels good and was able to put two large digital cameras, four lenses and room for more. Love it 
If you are a believer in protecting your expensive lens purchase with a filter than you can do a lot worse than a Tiffen filter. The glass quality is good and the price is reasonalbe. The filter cuts down on the glare that can adversly effect some shots with out an uv filter as advertised. Not much else to say. 
works as advertised. you screw it on the end of your lens, and there you go 
Great filter for the price-no reason to spend more. The filter threads are high quality, and it is possible to stack filters if you want-not recommended, though, if you are using it on a wide-angle, as I am. No vignetting, sturdy filter. 
A UV Filter is about as standard as filters get. Tiffen makes a good quality filter and this was just as expected. The price was equilivant to other vendors and as expected I had no problems; ordering was simple and the product came on time 
This is a fantastic lens. It takes crisp, rich photos, has a large apperature that makes for impressive low-light photography, and includes USM technology for lightening-fast focusing. Since I am only a serious hobbyist, I can't yet afford another quality Canon lens...but for 2 years I have been perfectly happy to leave this lens on the camera (a 10D). Portraits, landscapes, indoor shots with no flash...it can do them all with ease, and the photos look great. This lens is a little heavy, and combined with my 10D the weight is certainly a consideration. But to me it feels well-balanced on the camera, and I like the substantial feel that the lens-camera combination gives. If you plan to use a flash, remember that this is a big lens and the built-in flash may not clear the barrel (especially on the 10D, before Canon redesigned the pop-up flash)...might want to think about an external flash head for the hot shoe. There's a lot of glass on the front of this lens, don't forget the UV filter for a little extra protection 
Exceptional images! I can shoot indoors with low light due to the large aperture. The lens is a bit heavy though! I had to choose between this lens and the 24-105 F4L IS lens. I went for the 24-70 F2.8L for the wider aperture. I have no regrets! I do miss the additional reach of the 24-105 F4L IS lens, but this was a compromise that I was willing to make. Once again, excellent lens 
There is very little doubt that this is one of the better Canon lenses available. However, why buy from AMAZON when it did a price increase of $73 as soon as Canon starts the 2006 fall rebate program. AMAZON has officially become the most expensive online retailer for this lens. 
I agree with all the positive reviews of this lens. It's a great lens, give's that certain silky smooth bokeh that the 24-105 lacks and gives a nice bright viewfinder. It does have a couple of quirks though- -It's very heavy so be prepared for that. A lens of this quality and high speed will need a lot of glass in there. -When you zoom out to wide, it actually gets longer which is a bit strange. Sometimes when you are taking a group picture and you need to zoom out a bit to fit everyone in the shot, the subjects see the lens moving towards them and think you are going in for a closeup. This can be partially remedied by using the included hood which masks the lens a bit and is always extended. 
After using both lenses I think this is much better. Here are my reasons: 1- f 2.8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate. 2- Bokeh is much better in this one. 3- Macro is slightly better on this one. 4- 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size. 5- IS is not very crucial in 24-50 range. 
This is a great lens. The pictures I take are very sharp and alive with color, and the brokeh is excellent. I am a big fan of keeping a shallow depth of field when shooting people or animals, so the f/2.8 helps out. Also dim wedding receptions are no problem with even the weak built in flash on my Rebel XT. The autofocus is practically silent, accurate and very fast. If you don't think you need f/2.8, go for the 24-105mm f/4 L IS. It has an extra 35mm on the telephoto end, image stabilization, and is lighter and smaller 
I think it very well could be so I'm not going to differ with those who say it is.I bought this to use with a new 5D and itt's simply outstanding in every regard. So far, I've kept it on the 5D and can't bring myself to take it off. I considered a couple of lenses, including the IS 24-105 f/4 which has a lot of appeal and the price is about the same. But this was the lens I chose in part because I already have a the 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS Lens and the overlap seemed a waste while the extra stop helps. I have no regrets about it. sharp as a tack and quick. I note that this is not compact lens, especially with the hood on and it can stretch out a lot when you widen the field. It is also not light. This lens and the 5D will give your neck and back a pain, assuming you work with more than one camera. But the focal lengths covered are just about ideal and require none of the compromises that a longer zoom range require. For that, I've got an 18-200 on a 20D. The 70-300 DO, while not an L, specs out in that range and has the virtue of real compactness, but it' not a lightweight. These two lenses cover just about everything for me. And I can keep the 10-22mm on the 20D for the extra-wide shots. Since writing the initial review, I've since traveled for several weeks with this lens and it fully lived up to expectations. Given the difficulties of travel these days, I am concerned about the problem of not being able to carry it with me -- not a problem to date except for Britain. But always possible. And, despite the weight, I might favor the 70-200 F/2.8L IS USM as a second travel lens- I like the brightness of the focus. One suggestion. There's a temptation to use this lens wide open a lot of the time. It's very good and sometimes that's the best thing. But I've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down a good deal for short night time exposures on a tripod and a remote release. The effect with lights, etc. is considerably different along with the extended depth of field. 
You are buying quality not price. Im amazed with the quality of the pictures I get with my new lens. It seems I changed my camera to a new model... totaly diferent pictures. I have compared to my previous cameras and lenses and WOW... I cant believe I thought I had some great pictures in my collection. I dont want to use my other lenses anymore, I have a new standard in my pictures. I have to say that it was a "crazy" decision to buy this lens because of the price, but this is an investment that once you have it you will enjoy and will last for many years. If you love photography and really like to go to full detail you wont regret it 
This lens is worth every penny I paid for it. No matter what the settings are, wide-open or not, at the end of the zoom range or not, you will get a sharp and contrasty picture. However, do not expect it to beat a prime - even the cheap 50mm f1.8 (that I also own) has a (somewhat) better sharpness and contrast, visible only when enlarged though. What you pay big bucks for is convenience 
I bought this lens to replace an EF 100-300mm (USM) that we had from my wife's film shooting days (not a common lens to have, apparently; the 75-300mm seems to be more widespread). That older lens produced some surprisingly good pictures (quite sharp), but handheld shots were hard to get right at long focal lengths. The image stabilization feature of this lens works remarkably well, but it's quite a bit noisier than that of the EF-S 17-85mm IS (my first IS lens; you hardly hear the IS gyrations at all on that one). The sharpness is quite good (probably a tad better than that of the EF 100-300mm, although it's not a foremost strength of this lens in my opinion). I was surprised by how much faster I can acquire focus with this lens, even though reviews suggested that it still falls short of L-series lenses (see e.g. the "flying gull" shot I uploaded to the "customer images" set). If you want to shoot hand-held at 150mm+, I don't think this lens has much competition under $1000 for Canon EOS users 
Great company - delivered product on time. Tested out the lens in Mexico, Brazil, and Canada. When the automatic settings on camera (Canon 10D) were selected and pictures were taken outdoors with a lot of daylight, the background is overexposed. This results in things like clouds not being included in the picture. Manual settings and adjustments within the camera will remedy the problem. However, there is an expectation that lens from Canon should take quality pictures from the automatic setting. Otherwise the lens works great 
This is a terrific lens, my new favorite. IS is an excellent feature; I wish all my lenses had it. Even with a 2X Teleconverter on, it is rock steady viewing and shooting. My images are sharp as a tack with great contrast and color. I'd have to pay three times this much to get any better telephoto images 
Have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting, at sporting events (indoor and outdoor) and at concerts. Fast focusing and great image stabilization (IS does use quite a bit more power, though). Have not had one problem with it. Solid build and has a little heft to it. It is a bit pricey, but I chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens. 
The Canon EF 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM telephoto zoom lens replaces the first Image Stabilizer lens of its kind, the Canon 75-300mm f4-5.6 telephoto zoom lens. It offers now up to three - as opposed to two - apertures in image stabilizing mode, as well as slightly wider focal length. The current June 2006 Popular Photography issue has a fine test report on this lens, showing that it is capable of excellent contrast and resolution in the range from 70mm to 200mm; at 300mm, both contrast and resolution decline slightly to very good, but still an excellent result for a zoom lens in this class. It is also fully compatible with Canon's digital SLR cameras (112-480mm equivalent), with improved lens coatings optimised for digital sensors. Without question this is an excellent lens for the Canon photographer interested in excellent nature and landscape photography, without resorting to a sturdy tripod to hold both the camera and lens; thus it is also quite suitable for handhold panning shots at most outdoor sporting events held under good weather conditions 
This is a good zoo lens. It is not as heavy or noticeable as something like the 100-400 L lens. Also, with the 3 stop IS and smaller size and weight this makes a great backup lens to the 100-400 on trips or when I just don't feel like carrying around a 3+ pound lens all day. So if you don't want to have to deal with the cost or size of an L series lens this is one of the next best options 
After debating between this and the 70-200 L series I decided to purchase this lens. I have been pleasantly surprised by the results. I also own the 17-85 and the 50mm 1.8 lenses and I have found that I have gotten the "most pleasing" results from this lens. The pictures have been very sharp from my 20D - even in the 200mm - 300mm range. I've also been happy with the quality of the bokeh. The primary drawback I see is that the AF tends to hunt a fair amount when confronted with low contrast images. That being said, I used it for some flying bird shooting at the wildlife refuge and was surprised to see how many of the shots were in sharp focus. However, it was a little bit of all or nothing. Several shots were also wildly out of focus. Since the lens is fairly slow to focus, you never know what you're gonna get with such a fast moving object against the distant sky. I had much more consistent results when shooting soccer, softball and football in the park. The AF speed did not present an issue for any of these activities and the results were excellent. I wish the lens were a little less expensive but I the prints I have gotten from my 13 X 19 printer have been worth the extra money 
This Canon Lens upholds the tradition of fine products from the Canon line of photographic accessories. It takes very clear, sharp, hand held pictures with the Image Stabilizer capability activated. It negates the necessity of carrying a tripod every time one wants to take long telephoto shots. It should be a must for any serious photographer that wanders the countryside, taking candid pictures, and wants to lighten the load of equipment carried 
I have used the 1.4x II extender for over a year. It gives me amazing detail with my 70-200L f/4 lens on a 20D. I use it mostly for wildlife and butterflies. Contrast is good with colors that pop. When shooting on a sunny day the shutter speeds are still quick with the f/5.6 and the background is blurred beautifully. In shade areas and low light a tripod is a must! There hasn't been any sacrifice in subject detail. I can see individual hairs on butterfly bodies even when shooting wide open. This is a great way to get closer without paying a significant amount for a supertelephoto lens 
The 1.4X II teleconverter is a modest update to Canon's earlier 1.4X TC. The mark II allows this extender to be stacked with another of Canon's extenders (either another 1.4X II or the 2X II) without having to separate the two with an extension tube (although the loss of sharpness from stacking extenders may not be acceptable to you). Otherwise, the quality of the newer 1.4X II is supposed to be very similar to the older model, which I've never owned. The 1.4X II is a great way to extend the reach of compatible lenses. Note that not every Canon lens is compatible with this extender. The following is from Canon's Web site: "This tele extender can be used with fixed focal length lenses 135mm and longer (except the 135mm f/2.8 Softfocus lens), and the EF 70-200 f/2.8L, 70-200 f/2.8L IS, 70-200 f/4.0L, and 100-400 f/4.5-5.6L IS zoom lenses." I use it frequently with my Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS, which turns it into a 98-280mm zoom. The extra reach it adds is not tremendous, but it's very welcome when I just need a little more than what the lens alone can give me. I've found no appreciable loss in sharpness from using the 1.4X. Of course, any extender is going to reduce sharpness to some degree, but with normal examination, I can't distinguish photos taken with the 70-200mm that use the 1.4X from those that don't. The fact that the 70-200mm f/2.8L is a very sharp lens to begin with helps in this department. Using the 1.4X decreases your lens' widest aperture 'capability' by one stop. With some lenses, that can be more significant than it appears on the surface; when using a non-pro Canon body (such as my 20D) the lens must have a minimum wide-open aperture 'capability' of f/5.6 for autofocus to work. The lens doesn't have to be set at f/5.6, it just has to be 'capable' of at least f/5.6 after adjusting for the one stop loss from the 1.4X. That means with some camera/lens combinations, adding the 1.4X will force you to focus all of your shots manually. (Note: There is a known 'fix' for this that restores autofocus. I've never needed to try it, but it involves taping over some connector pins on the 1.4X to fool the camera body. Proceed with caution if you try this, and do a Google search to learn how to do it right before attempting it.) The 1.4X also reduces focus speed very slightly. I've only used it on my 70-200mm IS, which has Canon's USM and is a fast-focusing lens to begin with, but the decrease in speed is so slight I really don't notice it. And it does not affect IS (Image Stabilization) at all. The 1.4X is built to the quality of Canon's L-series lenses, which means that it is weather sealed and will keep a Canon pro body and L-series lens weather sealed when used with them. If you're considering this extender, you're probably also considering Canon's 2X II teleconverter. I do not own the 2X but did a lot of research on it before ultimately deciding to go with the 1.4X. The 2X decreases your aperture by two stops, and is reported to have a noticable decrease in sharpness--more than some photographers are willing to live with. On the other hand, I've never read a review that complained about the loss of sharpness from the 1.4X. If you've already invested a lot of money in telephoto lenses, the 1.4X II is a relatively inexpensive way to get even more reach (and value) out of your investment while adding only a modest amount of bulk to your camera bag. Highly recommended 
Wonderful camera. Very flexiable, very versitile. Can be the most wonderful creation device in someone whom is capable. Def a good buy now that the 30D is out. I've had this camera for over a year and I STILL love it 
Excellent Camera with high end capabilities. Easy to use and intuitive system controls 
I am just a hobbyist. This was a big purchase and a big step for me to get into this level of camera. I still haven't mastered using it yet, and I've had it for a few months. It does a wonderful job of taking pictures. If you have the right lenses, it can take some of the most beautiful pictures you've ever seen. Again, I'm just a hobbyist/enthusiast. I use it to take pictures for work, too. I highly recommend getting a couple of VERY good lenses to go with it. Don't go with the cheap lenses that Canon, Tamron, Sigma, etc. make for this camera. Do yourself a favor and get a nice zoom - spend some bucks. You'll be happy you did. The camera itself is pretty easy to use if you leave it on auto, but that's like buying a race car and never shifting out of first gear. The auto settings are great, and they do a wonderful job, but you can do so much more if you learn to use the camera in Manual, Av, Tv, or P mode. It allows you so much more creativity that you'll be amazed at the difference. The 30D came out right before I bought the 20D, and I would probably buy it for the price now, but I'm very happy with my 20D 
This camera is really great. I knew I liked it before, but I immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when I ended up with a Rebel XT as a "loaner" while my 20d was in repair. Not that the XT is a bad camera, it just doesn't really compare to the 20d. The 20d has a nice feel to it; it is fairly large, which is great since I have somewhat large hands. The features are great too. And the image quality is awesome. I don't really need to go into all of the details, as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job. Let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars. The only complaint I have about the camera is that it doesn't have spot metering. The ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d. 
Impressive feature list wih affordable price, for the serious ameteur. i've been using the 20D with 18-55, 50mm 1.8, 35-80, 80-200 and 500/1000mm lenses. i am not disappointed. i am planning to upgrade to the L series lenses but slowly. i do not mean to be over entusiastic about canon, but i am yet to see a Nikon camera with the same specs at the same or ever a near equal price. i've got the FM10 for film photography. i love both my cameras. Impressive features include: Mirror lockup ISO 3200 with noise reduction 18 custom functions accepts the entire series of canon lens. heavy metal body (no cheap plastic feel 
This is a great camera. Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed. Sturdy frame. The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice. Buy the body separate and add a better lense. On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix. It was two months before the camera was returned. Sorry, Canon... you lose a star for that 
This camera is amazing, I couldn't have asked for more. Just be warned that the manual is pretty terrible. It's best to just play around with the camera until you figure it out, rather than wasting time trying to decipher the manual 
My kids are in competitive Tae Kwon Do. I have now used the camera my wife gave me one year ago at several tournaments. It is able to stop action and take great shots even in low lighting. Now, we tried it when we went skiing and it also worked great in the glare conditions of the snow. I bought a monopod that worked real well to stabalize and I use software called PhotoFinale to crop and share the photos. One year into the usage I am still looking forward to each chance I get to play with this "toy". Next options: battery grip, flash diffuser, extra remote flash.. 
I bought this camera about 2 months before my son was born. I knew little about Digital SLRs, but after research I found that this was the one for me. This camera is well constructed and durable. The pictures are excellent. I have blown a few of my pictures up to 11X17 without any problem. Also, if you are going to be doing any editing of photos on your computer, this camera would be great. I would recommend purchasing the newest version of Photoshop or Photoshop elements (when I bought mine it only came with Elements 2.0 and 3.0 was already on the market). Also, if you want your pictures to turn out, you MUST purchase a larger flash. The onboard flash is weak, will leave shadows and it does not allow you to do any type of "bounce" flash. On the whole, this is the best camera I have ever had in my life and it would be great for anyone who has previous experience with SLR cameras. 
I have gone from the old 640x480 about nine years ago to a 3.1m for the last few years to the Canon 20d now, what a pleasure to shot. The battery life has not been an issue even with over 250 shots, which should be sufficient for most anybody. There is a small learning curve but you would expect this with any new camera. The lens choice was a great idea which came from an earlier review of the excellent walk around ability of this lens from the general shots to the closeups of those favorite flowers. For those individuals who are on the fence about this product I tout it to all I have spoken to. It turned a good photo experience on our west coast road trip into a real serious photo shoot, it also uses the commonly accessable compact flash. The built in flash works well have not had to explore the options at this time. The delivery of this item when promised was a nice bow on the package 
It does what it's supposed to do. Nothing more, nothing less. If it were a little cheaper, I would have given it 5 stars. 
I initially bought this switch to be able to take fireworks pictures with my 30D on a tripod. It worked well for this application. Got some GREAT shots of the fireworks. Have since used it for some wildlife photos and it works well in this application also. The cord from the camera to the switch is only about two feet long. Sufficient for use on a tripod, but perhaps just a little short for any other application for the switch. I consider it "overpriced" for what it is, but if you need a manually operated remote switch, it performs this function well. The release button has an option where you can lock-it "ON". It's useful if you what to leave your camera's shutter open for a long exposure. I didn't research any other brands of remote switches for my Canon 30D. There may be others, but I was in a hurry to have something before the 4th of July, and just ordered it, since I knew is was suppose to work with my camera. It performs it's intended design function. It's overpriced, in my estimation, but if you need one, this one will perform the job. 
Aside form the fact that Canon charges an arm and a leg for a 1 dollar piece of plastic, the remote switch does work well. It does not feel very sturdy and does not seem nearly as well built as the Canon cameras. People with big hands may have a little trouble using this product. Overall, a "must have" addition for anyone interested in long exposures, images with excellent sharpness and depth of field 
Typically fine original design by Canon. I have a "Chinese" copy - it really is - and it works but it's not the same as having the mfr's own. 
It is simple, handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera. But I am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks... This wired release would be the choice only if you are not a Digital Rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button. 
The RS-80N3 works as advertized. The cable could have been longer but other than that I am totally pleased 
Manufactured of a soft gray felt like material, a tough leather bottom, and draw string closure at the top, this lens pouch helps protect your lens from dust and the elements. I store my lenses in a camera bag, and these cases fit nicely around the lens taking up little precious space. This case is meant for use with the Canon 28 to 135mm f3.5-5.6 IS USM, and the 28 to 200mm f3.5-5.6 USM EF lenses. These lenses do not normally come with the case when sold new. Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering depending on how you store your lenses. PROS: Protects your glass investment CONS: I cannot think of an 
This lens pouch is very durable and is of a good quality. It compacts down and does not have unneccesary bulk. Might seem alittle pricey but is worth it in the long haul. 
Well, it's Canon, so there is no doubt about the quality. The only downside -- because it doesn't have a string the cap is very easy to misplace. Always put it in your pocket everytime you remove it from the camera to shoot pictures 
I have the lens, I have the cap....and its been so long since I bought both that I don't remember if the cap came with the lens or not. SURELY it does !!!!!!! I do love my add on lenses but I will have to say that now that I've added all these other toys (macro, wide angle, telephoto, filters) I now realize I shouldve gotten a SLR digital and held out for true lenses instead of the conversion option. I love my S2IS but just think how nice a real camera would be !!!!!! sigh... 
Good quality, and perfect attach, but no cord to avoid loose it. Incredible that Canon forget it!!! So... remember to put it inside your pocket when you use your camera 
Lost your old SLR lens cap? This is what you are looking for. 
I got this lens cap when I ordered a close-up lens for my camera, a PowerShot S1 IS, because it was recommended as something people who ordered that part would also order. I, therefore, assumed that it went with the same camera, or with the lens/adapter I was ordering. However, it does not appear to fit either the camera itself or any of the attachments, so I now wish that I had done some more research to determine whether it would actually fit my equipment 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
It seems unfair to compare this camera to a 10D (or 20D or 30D), either favorably or unfavorably. These instruments are good in their own right, but hardly are in the same league as the 1DS Mark II. I have used all three of the xxD's, and an original 1ds body as well. It occurs to me that the folks who are interested in shelling out over 5 grand for a camera already have an idea about what they want, and that some of them are asking if they should trade in their 1ds body for a mark ii. It is to them that I am adressing this review. The remarks, I think will help those who have less experience with the line. Bear with me for the technical jargon and the emphais on Mark I vs II comparison. I want to help the buyer to decide if there really is a reason to spend this kind of money. First, regarding resolution: you probably won't be able to tell the difference between Mark I and Mark II unless you are doing studio work. An 8x10 image is virtually indistinguishable. Most of us shoot in .jpg mode, and we don't mess with RAW. If you are doing a 17x20 wedding portrait and are working with uncompressed files, the Mark II is superior. I do outdoor work, so 11.6 megapixels is plenty. Finallyl, the quality of the glass makes a big difference (much more than the sensor resolution), so if you are a little strapped for cash, buy a 5D and spend the difference on "L" series lenses, or a used 1DS (Mark I). Second: Ergonomics. I like the histogram on the Mark II better than the older camera, and appreciate the improved burst performance, and storage times. Small but significant differences. The battery life is way better, and I like that. I can get 700 frames out of a charge in the Mark II and only 200 from the Mark II. Thank you, Canon. Maybe in the next iteration they will do something with the black brick of a charger. I can only hope. Third: Sensor noise. Most ofthe high-end cameras are CMOS now, and each time we look at a new generation of pictures we are wowed by the decrease in sensor noise at high ISO's. I remember that the we praised the Mark I for the low noise up to ASA 400. For the uninitiated, sensor noise is the random firing of a sensor due to quantum effects, and manifests as sparkle or random changes in pixel color. It is more prominent in low light and high ASA. The Mark I is great up to ASA 400, good up to 800 and needs some digital filtering at 1200. The Mark II is really good up to ASA 1600, and with a Photoshop filter is good to 3200. If you shoot in low light, the Mark II is for you. Fourth: Color balance. I always loved the warm, saturated pictures that the Mark I gives, so don't get me wrong - better color rendition is not a reason to sell it for a new model. The Mark II, though, improves on it and gives beautiful color saturation with some improvement in the range of highligts. Digital photo buffs will know what I mean: if you take a picture with broad highlights, like a sky, the foreground objecst will be underexposed. and the highlights clear. Set the exposrue to the foreground, and the sky will be a burnt-out white. The Mark II has improved this much, but it still needs some work by Canon. For now, it helps to have taken a large number of pictures to get an idea as to how to set the exposure. Fifth: Accuracy of the exposure. The Mark I had an annoying tendancy to overexpose by about a stop. I got used to turning down the exposure 1-2 stops, exposing on the highlights, and using Photoshop to correct the exposure. The Mark II is more accurate, and the Manual exposure is close to the metered exposure. Sixth: The FF/1.6 business. I really don't see any reason that a 30D is a better camera because a 50mm lens gives an image analagous an 85mm lens in a full frame camera. Be advised, though, that lens evaluations depend on this distinction. Edge performance and flair may be more obvious on a full frame instrument. Both the 1DS and the 1DS Mark II tend to challenge lenses more because they work the full range of the lens from side to side and through the apertures. My 35-135 IS Canon lens gave great pictures on the 10D, but looks washed out on both of the 1Ds's. Before giving the 1DS Mark II a bum rap for less than perfect pictures, ask what lens was used. Seventh: Price. Presently, a non-grey-market 1DS Mark II sells for around $6899 from reputable dealers. A used Mark I is around half that. I would take a half star away from Canon for the pounding my pocketbook is taking, but I understand that a Mark I was just about the same price when it was released. The price gradient presently would be tolerable for those shooting in low light, or for RAW studio work. Personally, I would buy a Mark I over a 5D for the improved construction. Finally, some general remarks. I would have liked to compare this fine camera to the comparable Nikon. Unfortunately, I cannot, because all my glass is Canon, and I have no money left for a mult-thousand buck purchase of a Nikon. Maybe someone else would write a review. My only beefs with Canon have to do with sensor dust, that seems to appear by spontaneous generation, and the steep learning curve that I had with my first use. (Plan on a night or two reading the manual) I guess I can forgive them for not putting a flash in it. Add a couple of hundred to the price for the purchase of a 580EX. Canon service has been terrific. If you have the bucks, quit complaining about the price and get one if you are a serious photographer. Look at the images in dpreview.com (and the long, thoughtful review there), and at fredmiranda.com - they will leave you breathless. This is a serious instrument for serious photographers and far be it from me to give it less than 5 stars for my petty complaints 
First, the Canon 1Ds Mark II is an awesome professional camera. This review is about the completely misleading Amazon offer of 42% off. This is the biggest joke imaginable. The Amazon website shows the list price as $11,999.99. When Canon launched this camera the MSRP wasn't that high. It was $7,999. Methinks someone with a calculator got carried away. Anyway, after adding it to my cart to see the unbelievable low price it turns out its within about $100 of what every other reputable online shop is selling it for. I expected more from Amazon. This behavior is reprehensible 
The Canon 1Ds Mark II does not list for $11,999. Body only it lists for around $7,500 
i think this is the BEST buy anyone can do, is superfast, flexible (50-3200 asa) interchangeble lenses, long last battery, all excellent, the only bad thing is the high price but it worth it, its like having a ferrari, almost you want to keep it at home in case that something bad happens like being stolen or damaged even do that some people say that the big size is an inconvinencie i personally would not like a tiny camera as a professional photographer it woud look ridicoulous, so the size is a good thing also, when people that even dont know the camera are impressed by the stuff it has 
I have been shooting digital for four years now mostly with the Kodak DCS cameras(660 through DCSPro). Being a life long Nikon guy it was a big decision to make the switch to Canon and the 1DS MK2. This camera is light years ahead of any Kodak digital slr. I use this camera for studio product, models, location, low light, you name it. The Canon has never produced anything but astounding images for me. All image parameters including sharpness are far superior to any of the old images I have from my Kodak days. Yes it is pricey but if you are working with this camera you will pay for easily long before it's useful days are over. 
I am a Pro Photographer who formerly used Medium Format. I wanted to get a digital SLR with better than film quality. The EOS 1Ds MK II is it! It is weather/dust resistant (to a point) when combined with Canon's "L" series lenses, and if you own this body, those lenses are a must-have. The controls are easier to master than I first thought. It is fast, no shutter lag and fast write to card. The colors and details in shadow/highlights are amazing! Truly a joy to hold! If you want the best, this is it 
This is a must have product for any Digital Rebel XT owner. Always carry a spare fully charged battery. Amazon has a competitive pricing structure and very timely delivery 
I've been using these in the Rebel XT since about two weeks. On Friday I went to a show at a local bar and took about 600 shots in medium to low light conditions (just small stage lights lighting up the band) and finally killed the battery after about 2 1/2 hours/600 shots 
This item is a good companion to use as battery backup; I recommend this item to all people using a Digital Rebel XT. This battery has a long life after full charge, is very light and small piece you can accommodate into any pocket or bag, I'm very satisfied with this purchase 
I have a Canon ZR700 camera, it comes with one of this batteries. Since it was just giving me a little more than an Hour of recording, i felt i needed an extra battery. When i saw the options, because the high price on this product, i felt tempted to buy a OEM battery that's cost was 16.00 USD with shipping and it has good reviews from other customers. But them i found the Canon BP-2L14 here at Amazon, which gives twice the power for only 56.00 USD, just 13.00 USD to double the power and a original product (and double the size too, the only bad thing about it, but it is really not that much) 
I find Canon batteries work very well. I also do not mind not using AA - an extra NB-2LH is small and easy to carry around - easier than several AA (rechargable or not) 
Haven't used it yet (bought it for a trip next month), but it arrived as promised and was exactly as described. 
I bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. But the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the Error 18 (E18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. I searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then I read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many Canon cameras have the same defect... I am really mad and dissapointed on CANON, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or LESS and then throw your money to the trash 
I honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars. The moment I got it, I was delighted with the quality of the pictures (except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star), and by its portability. I've dropped it, abused it, took it to countless parties, countries and it is now FULL of scratches and bumps (GET THE CAMERA CASE!), and guess what: it still works as perfectly as the first day I got it. This little piece of technology is amazing, so if you're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality (for us amateurs, of course) just go for it. ACtually, I even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it. I even love it and rely on it so much that I won't change it even now that it looks all messed up. Don't think twice. Just go for it 
This camera is pretty good, it's very fast, the photo quality is excellent, video recording mode is awesome, and is perfect to carry everywhere since it's pretty small, but after several months of normal use, the metal case begins to look pretty rusted, that's why i dont give this camera a 5 star rating. But check the flickr photos, you will see examples of the great photo quality of the camera 
SD110 NOT A GOOD DIGITAL CAMERA. BETTER YET FIND SOMETHING ELSE. I'VE HAD THIS CAMERA ALMOST A YEAR BUT I JUST SELDOM USE IT BECAUSE THE RESULT OF THE PICTURES ARE VERY DISAPPOINTING. IT IS JUST FINE DOWNLOADING THEM ON THE INTERNET BUT WHEN YOU HAVE IT PRINTED ON THE PAPER, THE PICTURES GET BLURRED. NOW,IM LOOKING FOR ANOTHER DIGICAM THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT ME 
I just finished a semester in Brisbane, Australia. I must say, in retrospect, the best thing I took with me on this trip was this camera. She is a champ, definitely an adventurous camera. The thing is cute as hell yet solid like a rock. I cannot remember the amount of times I dropped it in the sand, with no negative consequences whatsoever. I even dipped it in the ocean by mistake once (not encouraged) and the thing still works like a charm. It also has features like Sepia and a weird flash that makes lights do something funny, making the pictures wicked cool. The outer covering has shown wear, but it only helps to acknowledge that this camera can take rough handling. People even comment on this on a positive light, it has become a part of my travelling gear. It is also great for scenic shots, and has the panorama option. In retrospect, it was an amazing buy, and so affordable (I'm on a backpackers' budget)! Only because I have seen amazing skies and breathtaking scenery would I consider upgrading to a camera with better pixelage. But if you are staying in hole-in-the-wall hostels or sleeping on the beach, you don't want to have an expensive camera on you. This thing is great. The battery life is also great (for the sake of topping off the cake) 
This is a great product. I have a rather large lens and it helps stabilize it so that I don't blur my pictures when I'm taking pictures of the kids playing soccer. However, people think I'm a professional photographer from the local newspaper when I use it at the grandkids' games. 
Strong and rigid, easy to control on the head so that you can have it loose for free movement but tight enough that the camera doesn't flop over. Opens and closes very easily. It's kind of expensive for $50 but its probably worth the money 
Solid design, quick and easy to adj height. Great way to steady camera. Doubles as walking stick 
It works fine, but the Canon S2 IS digital camera sometimes feels a little heavy for the monopod. 
I was very pleased with Amazons quick delivery of my new Canon monopod. The monopod is very easy to adjust and use. It's the ideal ridgid support you would want for your camera. It even doubles as a great walking stick, sometime need, on those long treks you make to get a good photo 
This monopod is exactly what I expected at a good price. It extends very smoothly, and the stops hold the leg firmly at the height I set. Easy to set up and adjust with one hand so I can change height with the camera attached 
I love this monopod! I'm a person who uses my camera nearly every day (Canon EOS Elan 7 35mm). This item is one of my favorite accessories for the camera -- so much easier to travel with than a tripod! It's sturdy, but lightweight, easy to use and is very portable. I am mostly using the monopod to support my camera with an enormous, extremely heavy 500mm telephoto lens attached. I'm actually able to hold that huge lens steady with just the monopod -- not one blurry photo! I've dragged it all over the Bluegrass of Kentucky ... across fields of horse farms, and even to the racetrack. I've taken it out into the wilderness to photograph elk. I had to keep closing it down and extending it out every time we got in and out of the vehicle, which was often. Also recently traveled all over Arizona with it to the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Canyon De Chelley, etc. I was constantly opening and closing it, taking literally hundreds of photos (about 14 rolls) with no problems at all. I'm wondering if the other reviewer just got a defective one. I wish I'd bought one of these years ago! I highly recommend it 
If you're looking for a high-quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors, you may have found what you're looking for. The 70-200/2.8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135/2 prime lens (although not quite as sharp). The main downside to this lens is that it's big and heavy. I don't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much, but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight. And it's not exactly the sort of lens that I would want to toss into my backpack, just due to the immense size. If you don't mind spending an extra $500, consider also the 70-200/2.8 IS (image stabilization) version of this lens. It weighs even more, but the built in IS unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens 
...there are two things that you should know. The first is that the f/2.8 version of this lens is big and heavy. The second is that the f/2.8 version of this lens is the more versatile and, therefore, the more useful of the two choices. Why is the f/2.8 more useful? It allows you to use Canon's outstanding extenders and still have a sharp and practical lens. With the 1.4x, you will have a very, very good 98-280mm f/4 lens. With the 2x, you will have a good 140-400mm f/5.6 lens. In both cases the lens will autofocus--very well with the 1.4x and adequately with the 2x. The use of the Canon extenders also allows the 70-200 to make a pretty nice close-up lens. The original close focus of the lens is maintained with the extenders, giving you both 280mm and 400mm focal lengths that focus closer than most prime lenses of the same focal lengths. While you can use the extenders on the f/4 version, it makes for some pretty slow lenses with limited applications. There's not much you can say about this lens that hasn't already been said. It's one of the sharpest zooms around with a look that, while certainly subjective, is highly appealing. I have a preference for prime lenses over zooms but I still rank this as one of my sharpest lenses. Is there any reason to choose the 70-200 f/4 lens over this one? Cost aside, I can see a valid argument being made for the f/4. Carrying around the f/2.8 in a full camera bag is no fun unless you're putting it to use. Since I mostly use shorter focal length prime lenses, sometimes the f/2.8 is a pain in the neck for me--literally. Unless I know I will need it, I have taken to leaving it behind in favor of a lighter, smaller and less sharp Canon 100-300. So I can see the utility of the smaller 70-200. Maybe I can talk myself into owning both. Nah, that's a little too excessive. 
I forgot my wife's birthday and she subsequently hinted that she wanted a telephoto lens... I started by looking at the cheap ones, but decided, that I might as well do it right if I were going to do it at all. When it arrived, my wife took it out of the box and we were both stunned by how massive this lense was. It's heavier than you might think as well (which means that the mounting ring that come packaged with this lens is an absolute God-send). The first thing we did was go out and buy a Mono-pod for it. Next we took it camping and then water-skiing and ended up with some of the most incredible, crystal clear shots we've ever seen. The autofocus was incredibly fast - I was able to hold down the button and snap through multiple exposures while speeding across the waves. Most of the time - the thing was right on. We then mounted it on a tri-pod and shot family portraits. This was the first time we had all the kids and grandkids together in six years and once again - the lens didn't let us down and the photos were fantastic. I don't have any real training with a camera (I use the Cannon Rebel and auto-focus most of the time) but this lens was worth every dime. ...It also worked to get me out of the dog-house with my wife.. 
I have a few 'L' lens, and this is by far my favorite. Reviews saying this is their favorite lens are not kidding. There are plenty of other reviews going over all the features, but I would like to add to the IS v Non-IS. I purchased the NON-IS version because I did not want to fork over the extra million-dollars for IS. If I knew I was to like this lens so much and it would become my favorite lens, I would have splurged for IS. Somewhere on the great-big-internet I read a comparison between the two versions. The IS version clearly shows less sharpness, but it was not clear if that is only when IS is on. And I'm not sure if it would be noticeable on Digital 
I don't personally subscribe to the notion that the big brand manufacturers always make the best lenses out there, but this is one instance where they really, honestly do. This thing is lightning fast, sharp as a tack, the bokeh is much better than Sigma's equivalent, and you'll have a hard time finding a use for your raw processor's chromatic aberration correcting sliders when coupled with a digital body (you CAN still get some purple fringing around backlit subjects, but genuine CA bad enough to show up in a print has so far proven non-existent for me at any focal length or aperture). The weight is a serious downside, but it's one I can live with. If you're a nature photographer who really has a problem holding still or if you plan on using extension tubes, the IS version might be worth the extra $700 to you, but if you're doing event photography where the subjects are the ones jumping around like rabbits, save your money and your battery power; ain't a thing wrong with this lesser model 
This is probably Canon's best value in a mid/long zoom. I got this the same day I purchased my 30D...along with the EF-S 10-22 and the EF 24-70 2.8L. Talk about pleased! No regrets whatsoever. This lens just screams quality. Images just pop out at you. If you're considering the f/4 model...take a hard look at this one. Add a hood (cha-ching) and (yikes) the $100+ tripod ring and the value of this lens really shows. It's a bit larger heavier but look what you gain! If you're one of those that considers the sweet spot of a lens to be stopped down a step or two just look at where that puts you on the f/4 compared to this one. And the focus speed is nothing short of "holy mackerel that's fast!" Sure, you could spend a few more bucks and get the IS version...but frankly, to me at least, if it's that important I'll be using a tripod anyway. Hmmm, just took the shakes out of the equation. All in all, a great lens at a decent price 
I keep it short and sweet. Very Sharp - quick autofocus. I use it with my Canon 20D. 
This hood comes with the 70-200 lens and my local shop didn't stock it. They said it was a special order part and that it would take a week for it to come in. I ordered it on a friday, and received it on a Wednesday. Not bad. Thanks Amazon 
I mainly use this when taking landscape shots where I want to either make the clouds pop or liven the sky up some (remember it works best 90 degrees from the sun.) I also put it on when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes that would otherwise cause blown-out highlights. One other little secrete is to use this when shooting waterfalls since it will allow you to shoot at slower shutter speeds thus increasing the wispy waterfall look 
Other reviewers have complained about the plastic foot on the flash-bracket end cracking or breaking off. The solution is a metal "sacrificial foot" that screws into the 1/4"-20 threads on the bottom. Bogen/Manfrotto 3298 (BO3298) works perfectly. No Amazon vendor carries it as of this date, but you can find it at bhphotovideo.com. Their listing says it's for Nikon, but it works for the Canon Off Camera Shoe Cord 2 as well 
I got this cord mainly for Macro work so that I could use long Macro lenses along with my flash without having to deal with the lens shadow in the picture. It is also very nice to be able to control the direction of the lighting by placing the flash above, below, or beside the subject. Red eye can also be almost entirely reduced by moving the flash further away from the camera body, so this cord is helpful for portrait work. It could be a little longer, but the longer it gets the more difficult it would be to pack it small spaces, so all-in-all I think they did a pretty good job. It works fine, if you want all of your flash's functionally, but don't want it in the hotshoe, this is a good choice 
This camera cord shoe works well. However, it can break relatively easily so I suggest having two at any given time. Also, the cord length can be too short at times and two long depending on your needs 
It gave me the option to change the angle of the light... this is a nice option to have I am sure 
There is not much to say about this, since there were no other alternatives for me. Simply stated, I went for the lowest price I could find. 
Had looked at this lens both at the camera shop and on line and finally decided after much comparison with other lenses to finally purchase it, have'nt regretted it one bit. This lens is clear with excellent color, saturation and sharpness without any or minimal post processing. Coupled with an external flash it's great indoors as well. Have been using it as my everyday walk around lens. Zoom range is excellent(Rebel XT/XTi 1.6 magnification). Though it's somewhat on the big side, it won't tire you out carrying it around your neck. Purchased the hood seperately which, for the money should have came with the lens. Anyway, this lens offers excellent value for the money and you won't regret the investment 
First off this is a very nice lens for the money. I have had mine now for about three months and love it. It is a great walk around lens the 28-135 is just right for most pictures of kids and landscape pictures. It has a fast focus and sharp clear pictures clear up to the 125 range gets a little soft at 135 but easily fixed with a little post editing. I have taken most of my pictures hand held and the IS works great. I even recommended it to a friend. I am using it on the 30D and it spends most of its time there. I am not sorry I purchased this lens and will be taking a lot more pictures with it in the future. 
I use this all the time at my son's soccer games and get great shots. It's a little on the bigger side, but isn't too heavy and image stabilization really helps out 
I have always used third party lenses before but after trying this Canon I have to say I am impressed with the quality, it feels like a solid piece of equipment rather than a hunk of lightweight plastic. I find my photos to be much sharper due to the IS and the lens itself. I have tremors in my hands and so was having a difficult time with a normal lens but the IS has helped tremendously for that. I like the range of zoom as it is pretty much all purpose for me( have used the kit lens only once since i got this lens when i needed a wider angle). I could occasionally/rarely use a little more distance but nothing is perfect. My only complaint is that the lens is heavy and pretty much doubles the weight of my camera( Rebel xt). You know it's around your neck after a few hours shooting. I haven't had any focus hunting problems,which i had constantly with the 3rd party lenses. and the lens is very quiet which is imo a good thing. For a reasonably priced lens it is well worth the money 
This can be a great 'only lens' for the day. Good weight vs capability for handing most photo opportunities you'll come across. Good price for the versatility the IS function provides 
This is a great lens that can be used for almost everything. It is great if you only want to take one lens with you. Pictures are very sharp and the color is good 
I originally purchased a 30D with the low-end kit lens - to me the pricing didn't really make sense to get either the body or the higher-end IS kit lens. I was looking for a good all-purpose zoom with full-size sensor covereage in case I move up the Canon ranks to a new pro-level model in the future. The 28-135 fits the bill nicely. Although it is fairly heavy, the difference in build and image quality between the 18-55 kit lens is incomparable. This lens takes beautiful pictures and operates flawlessly. I highly recommend it as a day-to-day lens, and the IS is a nice feature for extending the range down a few stops without moving up to the much more expensive faster lenses 
From all the reviews I read, I expected certain pros and cons from this lens. I was not disappointed. pros: very sharp lens with very good colors cons: vignetting at wide open, and a little too contrasty For myself, the pros outweighed the cons for the price. It is ideal for the 1.6 multiplier cameras, where it becomes a 38mm lens 
This is a cheap lens - old design, very plastic - that can prove terribly useful for those on a budget who want a wider perspective, especially on 1.6x crop factor dSLRs. I learned about "cheap" with this lens - broke the focus ring the day after delivery. But I blame myself too, and the replacement's given me no trouble, though I think my first one was a bit sharper than the second. By many standards, this lens will match or exceed zoom lens of comparable price (as a prime lens should). Autofocus is a little buzzy, but the main time you'll notice is when it loses its bearing and suddenly lurches way off target. Mostly, focuses quickly enough and well. Some chromatic aberration in worst-case scenarios, but nothing awful or unexpected. Vignetting, even on a 1.6x crop, can be noticeable, mainly in sky shots, but gradual rather than sudden. (Might be unacceptably worse on a full-frame camera.) Undue distortion seems minimal - haven't really checked but also haven't really noticed, if you see what I mean. Flare seems average, perhaps better than one would expect from such wide glass. Bokeh is nonchalant, not dreamy but never intrusive. But at the price, the positives make up for the negative and "average" tendencies. It's vibrantly colorful and contrasty almost to a fault. Hard light is a little more challenging with this lens, a little more tricky to balance exposure between highlights and shadows. It's softish wide-open, but very unobjectionably - have yet to regret shooting at f/2.8. My main lens is a 50mm f/1.4, and switching back and forth on the same aperture setting is perfectly functional in practice. Lose a little crisp for taking in four times as much space, and that's a trade-off I can run with. (Their filter threads match too.) At f/4 and higher, I get "plenty sharp," though I've never seen "unreal sharp" from this glass (as I have from the 50mm). "Crop factor" over-simplifies the effect of mounting a wide-angle lens on a 1.6x camera. Yes, the field of view will match 40mm on a full-frame, but the perspective will not, because you'll be closer to your subjects. Shooting live subjects (like bands, models, or street life) will require a learning curve, so beware mission critical work before you've broken yourself in so you can anticipate its exagerations. That said, I bought this lens primarily for "head-to-toe" model shooting in my modest studio, and it's been a real asset. Interestingly, it tends toward a very useful "slimming effect" that makes hippy girls look more slender and shorter girls more ambiguous in height (at least at the "head-to-toe" distance from them). Disconcerting at first but terribly useful once you've gotten the hang of it. (Beware chicken legs or the reverse from dramatic perspectives.) I read every review I could find before purchase, and this lens seemed to be a magic middle between the higher cost clarity of the 20mm and the cheaper lesser sharpness of the 28mm. Near as I can tell, I nailed it. This is not a spectacular lens, but a very very functional one if you need an affordable wider angle that generally won't let you down 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
Good quality product which actually measured slightly larger than indicated providing room for a good sized zoom lens. As usual Amazon shopping beat all others for pricing 
I bought this grip a year ago after shooting homecoming weekend at my school, Central Michigan University. The pain it saved my wrist being able to shoot sports vertically without having to hang my hand over the top of my camera was a HUGE relief. Recently though, after a year of solid use, I've been having problems with it. There will be days that my camera will suddenly say my batteries are dry - after charging them the day before. I've checked, and my grip is not part of the series that was recalled for a similar problem. I have to actually removed the grip, and the batteries, and restart the camera to correct the problem. --this is a big problem in the middle of a sports match-- However, the grip is a great addition to the 20D/30D models. It's not the same feel as using a 1D, but it's as close are you're going to get. And for $150, you can't go wrong with the vertical shooting and doubled battery life. It also simply evens out the weight of the camera, especially with the heavier L-glass lenses on your camera 
This is my first time to purchase a battery grip for a digital SLR camera and it was a good investment. I don't have to worry about running out of battery power and at the same time it works as a vertical grip for my camera. It also looks nice on my Canon 30D camera, coupled with an "L" series zoom lens 
I started with the battery grip initially wanting the double battery availability. Having used a 35mm with a hand strap and already realizing the value of the stability of such a strap, this was my second attraction for the purchase of the battery grip and last but not at all least, is the ability to use shoot from the grip itself, allowing full ease of rotation of the camera. Though I have never used the battery magazine that allows for the use of AA batteries, having it offers a backup should the canon batteries need charging and I am in the heat of shooting. I always travel with my charge AND four AA batteries. I would recommend this grip as a standard accessory for the EOS-20D and EOS 30-D. One thought to consider once on the camera it increases the overall height creating challanges with some camera cases. 
I appreciate the difference in balance the battery grip provides for long lenses. The E-1 hand strap that can be attached with this addition provides a very solid, secure grip. Also, the BGE2 comes with a carrier for 6 AA cell batteries for those instant dead battery emergencies 
I just received the Canon BGE2 Battery Grip yesterday and already have it attached to my EOS 30D (nice). The unit fits very well and is very secure. I had no trouble aligning and tightening the Grip to the Camera Body. I also found the additional shutter release very handy. In addition, the shape of the unit allows a solid "grip" in the Vertical orientation as well. I too already had an extra battery pack, as TWO Batteries are required. Please note that the unit COMES WITH the Canon BGM-E2 Battery Holder, which allows you to use AA batteries. There is NO NEED to buy this as an accessory (unless you want a second AA battery magazine). One accessory that compliments the Battery Grip very well is the Canon Hand Strap E1. This Strap is designed to work with the neck strap yet provides added security and control with the Battery Grip (and well worth the $25-$30) 
I had the similar battery grip for my Dig Rebel, and I never took it off the camera. So as soon as I bought the 30D, I immediately ordered this. The dual batteries allow me to do an entire wedding (close to 1000 shots) without ever having to switch batteries. Plus it really improves the grip of the camera with heavier/longer lenses. It has worked very well for me, and is a breeze to install 
I just attached my battery grip to my 300d for the first time today, and the difference was amazing. I already had an extra battery pack, so I charged them both up and slid them in right away. The added weight is a very nice addition to the 300d's small body, and I can already see an improvement in my ability to hold the camera still. It also makes the camera feel much sturdier. I have seen a few reviews that complain about the fitting. I have not had that problem. The connection is seemless for me, and there is no shimmy what-so-ever when I have a 70-300 lens attached with the camera on a tripod. So maybe this accessory was optimized for the XT? I love the extra shutter button as well, it makes taking picture in the portrait orientation EXTREMELY comfortable and easy. The buttom is almost exactly the same as the actual shutter on the camera as well, which makes it easy to go from button to button. After reading all the hype on this accessory, I forced myself to buy it, and I was not dissapointed! I recommend it to anyone using the XT. Buy it now or else 
Although people had problems with the first generation of this grip, I've been completely satisfied with mine. Recently, I've been shooting with a 300 2.8L, and it would be much more difficult without the extra length the grip ads to the body. Similarly, the second set of buttons for vertical shooting makes a big difference, too. (One note: when shooting vertical, it is hard to actuate the thumb wheel and impossible to use the joy stick--which I do frequently to change focus points--without moving my right hand.) By holding two batteries, the grip also keeps me from worrying about running out of juice during high volume shooting sessions. The grip still has a little flex in it, but I've never had any of the power problems that I've read about here and elsewhere 
This camera looks amazing, not that I will ever have the money for it. I am impressed that this camera was the choice to shoot a feature film! It was used to shoot Tim Burton's Corpse Bride 
I just upgraded from a 20D, and the speed just blows the 20D out of the way!! Image quality runs about the same for both cameras since they're both 8.2MP, but how the camera gets you those images is simply amazing. Fastest shutter out there, low noise, consistent color, spot metering, multiple spot metering, weather sealing, the list goes on and on!! This camera demands the best glass, but you won't be sorry.  If your serious about photography in any field, this camera won't disappoint!! A bit pricey, but believe me, it's worth every penny!!!! See some of my work at (... 
I'm a recreational photographer, and I love this camera. This is my 7th month with the beast -- since I pre-ordered it early from Amazon by MISTAKE. (Long story) Before buying the 1D Mii, you should know a few things: 1. It's easy to overlook the spec that the camera's USB connection is 1.1 not 2.0. This is 40 times slower, and Canon clearly intended the Mark II to be connected via firewire. That said, I occasionally use it with my laptop on the road, which only has a USB connection. It's convenient that the port is there, but my 1GB CF card takes a good half hour to empty. 2. By the time you've attached a solid L series or comparable lens to this camera, it weighs enough that lugging it around on your shoulder, even without a camera bag full of tricks, is quite a burden. Also, I was talking to a professional photographer who wouldn't buy the model just because cameras this heavy give her wrist trouble. If you've NEVER held a camera this size in your hand, I recommend borrowing one first or checking our your local camera store, even if you do ultimately buy from Amazon. 3. The camera conveniently supports both SD and CF cards. Unfortunately there's no way to copy between the two cards using the camera. It's not a gigantic deal, but there were times I had to wait to get home from a trip to free up the SD card when I didn't have a camera cable, but just an external CF reader. Those are really the only 3 things I wish I'd known before I bought the camera...but would they have affected my purchase? Probably not! As I said, I bought the camera by mistake. Has it been loads of fun? Definitely. I have prints almost as good as medium format - at 100 times the convenience. 
I cannot say enough about this camera! From the moment you pick up the box, you know you have quality. The construction and materials used is top notched. Contents of the box can be found elsewhere, so I won't bother with the details. Charging of the battery to full takes 2hrs. If you have memory on the battery from repeated charges without complete depletion, you can recondition the battery with the included charger. It just takes 8hrs. While many lament the fact that no Li-ion battery was included, Canon seems to have anticipated the needs of professionals in the field. One also has the option of being plugged into the AC outlet and not dependent on batteries. Reading the manual takes a bit of time. The camera has endless customizable functions which can be overwhelming at times. Not that it should deter you, but one will rarely need all those functions anyway. Using the camera did not seem too difficult. Many functions need the use of two buttons, which may take some getting used to. Navigating through the menu was confusing initally, but improved as time goes on. Autofocus speed is responsive and sharp. Shooting at high ISO's (&gt;1000) had minimal noise. Looking at some of my pictures taken with 1 fluorescent light in the room and an ISO of 1600, appeared as if a flash was used. Photos of my black lab was incredible considering the ambient light and high ISO. The camera is always ready to go. If you are in the manipulating within the depths of the menu heirarchy, and want to suddenly take a shot, just press on the shutter button, compose, focus, and shoot. Its quick and responsive. Incredible...! Some may be wondering the sizes of the pictures. JPEG's have 4 sizes and range from 1 - 2.8 MB; RAW files are 8.4MB. One can take an average of 800 - 1200 shots on a full battery charge--assuming one has the capacity to hold it. Prints on my i9900 are outstanding. Cost is a pretty penny and then some. Also consider that Amazon is an authorized Canon reseller. Many of the rebates require that you purchase from an authorized reseller to be eligible for the rebates. Also, some of the internet deals for the camera are not from authorized resellers. Overall, a very impressive camera. The cost for many may be prohibitive for many. The EOS 20D may be a more cost effective alternative, but I do NOT regret my decision one bit 
This tool transforms my DRebel XT's tiny little viewfinder into a usable one. At it's 1.25x setting it shows a clear picture with 100% coverage of what the viewfinder shows. At 2.5x, the coverage is much less but that setting is very handy for very critical manual focussing jobs. Remember to set your camera's diopter to it's default factory setting. Otherwise, flipping the angle finder between 1.25x and 2.5x magnification requires re-adjustment of the finder's diopter. Another big advantage of this little device is that it gives you the freedom to try exciting angles (hey, they don't call it the Angle Finder for nothing) without breaking your neck. The only minor downside is the initial learning curve in getting adjusted to the image shown by the finder. 
This is a great tool for those shots where you want to get down low. Macro work and landscape/waterscape shots near the ground are so much easier with the angle finder on than without. I have also used it when doing portrait work to get a more flattering angle without having to kneel or stoop over the whole time. Now for the negative. It fogs up much easier than the normal eyepiece, which makes seeing anything a challenge under some conditions. And the big one for me, especially with macro work, you loose some light when using the angle finder. So if you are already working in a low-light situation, this only makes matters worse. But in well-lit conditions where fogging is not an issue and you want to shoot low, this is an amazing accessory, thus the 4 out of 5 stars 
Hi Canon lover, It is perfect and professional for users who love to capture excellent image. Do not wait longer buy as soon as you can and you will not lose anything. Keep it up and have a wonderful day with Canon products. Best wishes, Appreciation Canon Product 
This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. 
Just use this to protect the lens. Good cheap alternative to a scratched lens 
I bought this filter for my 28-135 IS canon lens and so far it has worked out great. Unlike some of the other tiffen filters I bought, this one fits just right on the lens. All sides are even and it sits flush against the lens. I haven't noticed any artifacts from pictures I've taken yet, but I haven't really had much of a chance to take many pictures with the lens. The night shots I've take so far, I've been quite pleased with, however 
I'm very happy with the product and would recommend it to my friends. Your service is also excellent 
Recycle times fantastic. Batteries seem to last forever. Much less expensive than the alternatives 
Yes, it's overpriced, just like any specialty item. And yes, the screw attachment to the bottom of the camera is useless. But when you need fast recycle times or hundreds of flashes at a go, the CP-E3 is invaluable. You can strap the case to a light stand or flash bracket, and the coiled cord length is adequate for these uses. I use the elegantly compact Really Right Stuff flash bracket which has no place to attach the CP-E3, so the battery back without its case slips into my shirt or pants pocket. The case could also be strapped to your belt. The unit is a little weighty with 8 rechargeable AA batteries aboard, and I'd hate to see how many pieces this plastic gizmo would break into if I dropped it on a hard surface. On the top is a tunnel for a strap to hang it from something, and a strap should have been included. I made a loop from some hiking boot shoelaces (from which I also make zipper pulls) and I hang it from a knob on a light stand when shooting with a studio set-up. Without the short recycle times the CP-E3 allows, my 580EX flash would have gotten only one shot of my daughter bowing after playing her piece at a piano recital. Instead, I got three. Decide for yourself how important that kind of thing is 
Got this for my 580EX flashes for shooting weddings. Works great and recycle times are excellent. It will last an entire event filled with 2500mAH batteries 
I'm using the CPE3 with my 20D and 580EZ. I'm shooting over 500 wedding flash shots before I notice any slow down in the recyle time. Recycle is about 3 seconds after a full discharge and hardley noticeable for anything less. I am using "Digital" brand 2200 mAh NI-MH batteries. The Pack uses 8 batteries to recharge the flash capicitor while the 4 batteries in the flash are running the flash electronics. I am very happy this combination. By the way I'm using the Stroboframe Pro-RL flash bracket and it great. The battery pack of the CPE3 straps right to the bracket 
I bought this because I needed top recycle speed from my 550EX flash unit without spending a huge bundle. I shoot karate demos with my EOS Rebel digital, lots of fast action in a rather large space (meaning many full power flashes). With the digital Rebel set to ISO800 mode and the flash set to +1 stop exposure I can adequately cover the action in a basketball court sized gymnasium. Using this battery pack with 2000MaH AA sized batteries (about 6.50 for a set of 4 at walmart) I've taken over 400 pictures with no slow down in cycle speed. This particular pack uses 8 AA cells and is compatible with Lithium ion cells. The older version of this unit used 6 cells I believe, and was not compatible with Lithium ion batteries. The unit is very simple. A box with a light on it, a space for a strap (though none is included) a slide out battery tray with locking button and of course the connector with a coiled cord that hooks into the side of the flash unit. I'm sure they do it for reasons of resistance, but the cord is kinda short, thus limiting you to where you can hang the battery package. If your tripod socket is free they do include a screw designed to mount the battery package to the bottom of the camera (kinda useless if you ask me). The battery box comes with a fairly nice padded nylon case that includes a velcro strap, this is what I use to hang the battery package from a camera or bag strap and it works fine. Eventually I'll get around to finding something I can use for a strap as that will worry me less (with 8 batteries in this thing it's a bit heavy to be trusted to velcro if you ask me). The unit works the way it's intended but I think the price is exhorbitant for a hunk of plastic, the price should be about half what it is. If you can't go all-out and buy the top end with the rechargeable battery or a true professional (what they used to call 512) battery package then this is enough for most of us 
Can someone make sense of this for me please? """The smaller the maximum aperture, the smaller and lighter the lens.""" WTF? Anyway... it's an affordable range for those of us in the real world to explore. It gets 4 stars for price Vs usability for the Joe Soaps and the Jane Does like me out there 
So this is a great starter lens, it came with my canon body when I got my camera, and I've used it tons. It is light, smooth, fast to focus, and cheap. My only problem was the number of times I found myself stepping back because the 35mm end of the zoom wasn't wide enough. I now carry a 22-55 instead and love that lens (come on Amazon - get it in stock). If you're on a budget then this lens is great. If you can afford the little extra go for the 28-80 instead 
I am not a professional photographer, but I wanted high quality lenses to go with my Canon 10D (which I may upgrade soon). I researched for over a month before purchasing this lens, and I have not been disappointed. I only wanted to carry around two lenses, so I purchased this one, and the Canon-EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultrawide Zoom Lens. I have found this combination works very well for me. My uses include photographing landscapes, wildlife, sports events, and my family. The speed and quietness of the autofocus is outstanding, and the zoom doesn't compromise the quality of the prints. Even though the price is high, you really do get what you pay for in lenses. 
I love EF 70-200 f/4L USM Telephoto Zoom lens. The price is right, super quality of pictures in color and contrast. It is light weight about 1.5 pounds in comparing with its siblings, 70-200 f/2.8 with or without IS (about 3.5 pounds). I am think about to buy the new model 70-200 f/4L with IS. With IS, I can take pictures in lower light conditions, which I could not do it with my 70-200 f/4L. 
My first L lens. Very sharp and solid build. With Canon DR and Amazon GC, you can get it in lower $400!! 
At first, I had a selection of third-party lenses. Nothing bad, just none that were spectacular. I was somewhat disappointed in the shots I got. Then I bought the 85/1.8 and saw the contrast and colors I was expecting. Since then, I've bought several Canon lenses and this one is my latest. Like the title says, WOW. My first shots were in the house and around it and at all apertures and zoom lengths, the shots are simply incredible. Just fantastic sharpness - no PS USM needed! The colors are real and vibrant and the contrast is sharp and clear. This (and my 24-105/4L) is what lenses SHOULD be. Well built, solid and great glass. Sure, you do pay more. And you could enhance your shots with PS. But to see the results from these lenses vs the cheaper alternatives, you'll see what you spent all that money for! I'm sold on Canon 
This is a great lens, amazingly sharp. Only thing I would say is if I had the money the 2.8 IS version would be even better and certainly something I'll consider as an upgrade in the future. Use a fast shutter speed or mono/tripod with this thing. Anything below 250/sec gets to be a problem at 200mm 
This is a great lens. I do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens. It is not so heavy so I use tripod without using tripod collar (costs 119.99 in B H). This is the best value I have ever got for a lens. Now I can't wait to get 17-40mm f4L too. You can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at f4 and f5.6, of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject. People complain how ugly the hood looks but that is subjective. I like it because it works great and you can attach it in a reversed position on the lens so that it will fit in your camera bag. I think the fit and finish of the lens is beautiful 
Like the Canon EF 17-40 f4L USM, this is it's sister and $100 cheaper to boot! Excellent images at f4! Outstanding images at f9. A lightweight combination with the Canon 5D. An even lighter and more compact combination with the Canon Digital Rebel XT. The only gripe I have is having to purchase the optional and expensive tripod collar ring. The ring does add a bit of noticeable weight. Since I am not a steady shooter, I will be upgrading to the Canon EF 70-200 f4L IS USM when it is available in November this year. At least the tripod collar ring should fit on the newer weathersealed lens. 
I owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version. Overall I was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight. Sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses, and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur. If you are shooting mostly outdoors I would recommend the f/4. 
Like many people my decision on a telephoto zoom lens came down to buying the Canon 70-200mm f/4L or the Canon 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM. The trade offs seemed clear at first. The former performs slightly better (see Canon website for MTF data), is better designed built, is faster and has the "L" lens status. User comments and ratings (at more than one site) are slightly more favorable for the L lens. The 70-300mm has an improved IS and of course a longer focal length. Both cost about the same so money was not a factor in my decision. I eventually decided on the L lens and was initially disappointed. Photos ranged from wonderful to not very good at all. In fact, I almost returned the lens. Eventually I figured out the problem. My yard is heavily shaded so most of the initial photo's were taken in low light and I had selected shutter speeds that were too slow. To avoid camera shake you need to shoot at the reciprocal of the focal length or faster. Sounds simple but with the Digital Rebel XT (which I was using) you need to consider the camera's 1.6 multiplication factor. So at 200mm you need a shutter speed of 1/320 or faster not 1/200 like I initially thought. Once I made the speed adjustment things changed for the better. Still I have some mixed feelings about my decision. When the light is good this is a fantastic lens but with the IS feature offered on the 70-300mm I would probably get photos that I will miss with this lens.  I can't fault the performance of this lens for its limitations and I have given it 5 stars. In other words it does what it is supposed to do very well but my message to other buyers is to consider where you are most likely to use the lens before buying. Remember IS becomes increasingly important as you extend the focal length. If your camera is already extending it by a factor of 1.6 you may find IS a very attractive feature. (Note the 70-300mm has a recall on certain model numbers because of problems when using the lens in a portrait position.) By the way, I purchased from Amazon and it was a flawless transaction 
What a difference, after using the "standart" ef-s 18-55 kit lens that came with my Rebel XT now with this lens I can finally see that this is a really excelent camera but only if you use it with an excellent lens like this 70-200 F4 L. Great sharpness, color, solidly buit, obviously heavy but for taking outdoors photos this one is among the best of the best 
This is the lens I use most often. It is unbeatable for portraits and low-light photos indoors etc. It is very sharp and relatively light and small. I have also found it useful for aerial photography. I used to have the 50 mm 1.8 but upgraded because I like the extra low-light power of the 1.4 (which I often use) and the one-touch USM manual focus with distance scale (which is just a nice-to-have). That said, the 1.8 is a great lens too 
What can you say, other than it's 4 times cheaper than the 50f1.2L. Not an L, but a great bright fast quiet lens, small and optically superb. On a crop camera it's a 80mm portrait lens. Super 
After reading a number of on-line reviews, I bought this lens a few weeks ago straightly for its low-light photography capability. What I have gotten is a little more than I have bargained for. The pictures it produces have made a casual hobbyist like myself look like a pro, at least in the admiring eyes of unsuspecting acquaintances. Now only if I have the heart to mumble-jumble a few far-fetched jargons, I might have a new packing order firmly in place. When paired with my Rebel XTi, the 80mm effective focal length and wide apertures make it an ideal portrait lens. It is also compact, light-weigh and solidly built, has fast and acurate auto-focus, and most importantly, has superb optical qualities. The best part is I have gotten these without breaking the bank nor does it break my neck hauling it around. However, despite its low-light capability, the very attributes that make this lens outstanding for portraits, i.e., narrow angle of view and shallow depth of field at wide apertures, make it an odd choice for in-door group photos. Also if you are taking action shots, the 80mm focal length may not be long enough to provide a safe distance to avoid mishaps. Instead of being a distal observer, I have found myself an unwilling participant in the middle of the action ducking the camera from the ever-curious tongues of my Golden Retriever and her playmates. No wonder zoom lenses are so popular. What else is there not to like about this lens? Not much unless you are a proud owner of one mammoth of an expensive L prime lens. Well, it does come with a free hood and that wonderful soft leather pouch, doesn't it 
The lens is great! I'm using it on my EOS 20D, and the shots are beautiful. At the wide open setting (1.4), the depth of field is amazing and provides an absolutely outstanding boquet. This lens is definitely worth the difference in price over the 1.8. The boquet is much better. A little advice: avoid using the auto focus on your camera when using this lens... its too easy to catch any little thing in front or behind what you are intending to focus on, and you WILL see a difference, with just a small difference in depth. Manually, the lens will provide you with perfect shots every time! And its well worth the extra few seconds to make sure the shot is composed correctly 
The latest 50 f/1.4 EF lens is the best performing chunk of glass that any photographer can buy for anywhere near the price. Granted, the 50 1.8 lens is awesome for it's dirt cheap price, but it is outclassed by the f/1.4 in all respects. Others have already raved about the virtues of this cheap (not really) lens, so I'll just agree with with the strong points, and lay out the broad picture on an open table. First, the 50 f/1.8 is usually a fine lens. It is dirt cheap, has better quality control than anything built by Sigma, and is super light weight. That being said, it does have issues with lens to lens quality, it is "only f/1.8", has a plastic lens mount, and is pretty slow in AF. The 50 f/1.4, on the other hand, can darn near allow you to see in the dark through the viewfinder, can focus in total darkness with the right shoe mount flash, records tack sharp images at most all apertures, has great contrast, is light in weight, small in size, has a metal lens mount, and is pretty cheap to buy. It is NOT an L lens in construction, yet it offers L lens optical quality. It does have a USM, but it is the "old style" USM, and is not as fast as the modern ring type USM lenses. Still, it is very fast, it beats the speed of the throw away f/1.8 lens to death, and is pretty darn quiet. Also, despite the majority plastic build, and lack of distance data for E-TTL II flashes (the f/1.8 also lacks this feature) the f/1.4 lens does offer a very responsive full time manual focus ring that works like a charm for manual focus, or just touch up in difficult auto focus situations. This lens is all that, and everyone should own it as their first lens. Zoom lenses included in body/lens kits are just plain junk (sorry), but this lens will stay in your camera kit for decades, no matter what camera body is in your future. People who are using 1.6 crop factor cameras like the 20D, 30D, and Rebel line should bear in mind that the 50 f/1.4 lens is effectively an 80 mm f/1.4 lens when mounted on their cameras. That makes the 50 f/1.4 an awesome portrait lens, and the aperture and diaphragm design of the f/1.4 make it unbeatable for capturing shallow depth of field shots with pleasingly blurred backgrounds. As fine a lens as the 50 mm f/1.8 really is, it cannot begin to compare to the 50 mm f/1.4 lens in terms of functionality. Buy this lens today, and it will be with you until the end, no matter what Canon body you use in the future. If you use a 1.6 crop factor camera today, this lens will become a favorite, and the best 80 mm portrait lens you have ever owned. As always, use it with the factory lens hood at all times (only about twenty five bucks), and use a UV filter that is multi coated on both surfaces at all times. Anyone who suggests that you use a cheap filter is steering you down the wrong path. No matter what lens you buy, always use a UV filter that is built at least as well as your lens. Cheap filters, and filters that are not multi coated on both surfaces are just plain garbage. The shame of it is that even Canon offers garbage filters for cheap, and many people who spend hundreds of Dollars on a lens claim that "If it's good enough for Canon, it's good enough for me". Nonsense. A cheap filter is just that. A good lens with a cheap filter might impress, but a good lens with a great filter WILL impress. Don't fall into the cheap trap 
When I worked as a photojournalist many years ago, 50mm was the "standard" lens in that it came closest to a real world perspective, especially for street photography. That is no longer always true because of the field-of-view crop of many cameras. Canon's popular digital Rebel and its successors, for example, have a 1.6X view that turns a 50mm lens into an 80mm lens. The 1D MARK II has a 1.3X view that makes it a 65mm lens. So, if you're looking for a standard lens today, 35mm probably is closer to the mark on those cameras. And Canon has a couple of options there - a 35 f/1.4 that is great and expensive and a 35 f/2 that is a good value at about $250. If you're still looking for a 50mm, however, there now are four options from Canon: 50/1.2, 50/1.4, 50/1.8 and 50/2.5. Here are the pros and cons of each: 50/1.2 is the newest, fastest and the most expensive at about $1,600. It is an "L" lens, which means it is more durably constructed than any of the others. The image quality is a cut above all of the others, especially at wider apertures. If money is no object, you'll probably want this one. But most of the rest of us have to ask the question whether it's 5X better than the 1.4. 50/1.4 is maligned by some for the softness of its images at f/1.4, but for me its a good, compact, low-light lens at a terrific price ($325). And the lens gets sharp quickly as you stop it down. It's sharp at f/2 and very sharp by f/2.8 with good contrast and colors. 50/1.8 is a step down from the 1.4 in speed, image quality, build quality and the smoothness and noise of its autofocus. But it is a big step up in value - a decent lens for about $80. If you're just getting into digital photography, this is a great lens to learn on until you get a better feel for the lenses that you want/need. 50/2.5 - this is a macro lens, although you can use it for general photography, too. I wouldn't recommend it. If you're doing macro photography, spend a little more for the 100/2.8, which is a sharper lens that gives you more subject distance. If you're looking for a standard lens, you'll appreciate the wider aperture of the 1.4. All that said, of the 50mm Canon lenses, I think the 50/1.4 still offers the best mix of image quality and value. 
This is an awesome lense, especially for the money. I would still purchase this one. There is nothing second rate about it. However, Canon has a new L series version on their website as does B H photo. It is a 50 mm NORMAL EF f/1.2 L USM for 1599. 00. I heard of photographers who shoot whole weddings with this one 3 hundred dollar lens 50mm lens. 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
This works just as described. As long as flash i-red beams see eachother it works fine... But radio controlled flash is much better 
I have a 580ex and it works great. I was hopeing that it would work for a studio light but nope so dont try it. The only thing you have to be mindful of is the distince that the flash is from the subject 
My take on this lens is that it is an "L" quality optic in a fine, non "L" package. There is nothing else on the market to compete with it (nothing at all), and it produces supurb images. It isn't an f/2.8 lens, but it is close enough for most uses. The competition from Tamron is a full stop slower, not as sharp, and is awful in dim light compared to the Canon 10-22 lens (sorry, Tamron fans, but the Tamron lens isn't even playing in the same ballpark). I use this lens on a 30D body, and I always keep it on hand if I'm doing any indoor, or tight group photography. It is the perfect solution to the perennial problem of not having enough room to capture all the kids at a birthday party in one shot because your back is up against a wall. This lens will just about get your toes into the picture at the widest setting, yet delivers tack sharp, colorful, and contrasty images. The auto focus is spot on, silent, and fast. It is a must have lens for the active amateur, or any pro using a 1.6 crop factor camera. You simply can't beat this lens with anything available on the market today. That beng said, do not try to convince yourself that this will make a good "walkaround" lens. It isn't. Even at max length, it is far too short to live on your camera as a standard lens. You need this lens, even if you don't know it yet, but it should not be your first lens, as it will only be used 15 to 20 percent of the time. At those times, it's performance simply cannot be equaled by any other zoom lens on a 1.6 crop factor camera. You will be amazed by the quality of this lens. It rivals the performance of modern prime lenses, presents a bright viewfinder image, and delivers the goods in tight situations. This is not a casual assessment, nor a Canon "feel good" moment on my part. I developed my first B contact prints in 1964, in my own darkroom at the age of 9 (my parents were concerned:)), and have been an avid photographer ever since. Small, medium, and large format cameras and lenses have passed through my hands over the years, and Canon has become my favorite small format brand. Still, Canon builds some trash lenses that should be avoided. The 10-22 USM is not one of them :). Before you go out and buy this lens, you should already own the EF-S 17-55mm IS f/2.8 lens. That is the king of 1.6 crop factor standard lenses, and includes the awesome Canon IS feature. It will end up being mounted on your camera 80% of the time, and keep you smiling after every shoot. Get that lens first. Then, get the 10-22mm lens. Then, let your imagination run wild, and plan on serious telephoto lenses for the future. Trust me or not, the two lenses mentioned above will provide you with photographic tools that will astound you. Get them in your kit as soon as you can afford them. A little warning about either lens.... Some here will argue the point, but with either lens, get a GOOD quality UV filter that is multi-coated on both sides, and built extra thin to avoid vignetting at wide lens settings. A good filter will cost a little less than one hundred Dollars, and can cost up to one hundred forty Dollars. The minimum brand would be Hoya Pro 1 multi coated filters, and the ante goes up from there. Everything else is garbage, including the Canon "sharp cut" filter that costs less than fifty bucks. No kidding, no conjecture. If you use cheap filters, you will never see what your lens can really do. Ever. No doubt that many will respond with claims that their twenty Dollar filter works just fine, but they simply don't know any better, and have never used their expensive equipment to it's full potential. It's akin to a Chevy owner passing judgement on a Mercedes Benz. The Chevy might feel real good, but until you own the Mercedes, you just have no clue. Bottom line.... Make sure that the quality of your filters exceed the quality of your lenses. Yes, at a hundred bucks a pop for a 77mm filter, it hurts, but you will never regret it. Also, Amazon does not stock lens hoods for all non L Canon lenses. The price is stupid high for those hoods, but they make a night and day difference in in picture quality. Whenever you order a non L Canon lens, find a web seller who has the hood in stock, and get it right now. Again, you will never regret owning it. That's it for my review/rant. Buy this lens. Buy the 17-55 IS f/2,8 first. Buy the lens hoods for both. Toss any "kit" lenses that came with the camera in the trash bin (where they belong), and be very happy. 
I had a chance to compare it with a Tokina glass. Canon is better on a contrast and better on a distortion, same or even slightly worse on a sharpness, and complete looser on a build quality. If you are ok with 12mm - get Tokina 
Technical details on this lens can be found in abundance elsewhere, so I'll leave that to the experts and simply say: This is my favorite lens. I love this lens SO much. I have half a dozen other medium to high-end lenses, and this is the one I keep on the camera 90% of the time 
Up Front: If you're considering this lens, stop considering - and buy it. I had occasion to try the Tamaron Zoom in this range and noticed plastic-y digital qualities in some of the Tamaron's highlighted-texture areas. None of that is a problem with this Canon beauty. I am using it as my normal lens. The contrast is razor-sharp enough to shave with. It's graphic in monochrome and colors are pure and leap off the monitor like a politician attracted by a TV camera. It's also light weight and plenty fast enough with practically no spherical Abs.... Tiny problems include an understandable perspective bulging on subjects about the edges. And there is some blue fringing on very high contrast edges. Photoshop nails the latter dead'er than Britney Spears' career. I've had a need for reasonably large blow-ups, with most captures cropped, yet still enlarged up to prints that are minimally 13X20. At that size not only does this lens reproduce a subject's pores, but you can peer down and see the stuff inside the craters. 
The Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM SLR Lens for Canon EF-S SLRs (like the 20D and 30D) is a good all round lens though it can be soft at 10mm. It only works with EF-S compatable cameras which presently have 1.6x multipliers so the lens is effectively a 16mm to 35mm. If you need to shoot in cramped spaces, or you shoot lots of interiors and you need a wide angle, and have an EF-S SLR this lens is required equipment 
A exceptional portrait lens for both digital and film, the Nikkor 85mm f/1.8D is usably sharp wide open and tack sharp by the time you stop down even just a bit. Relatively small and very light, it feels just right in my hand. Steve McCurry is one of my favorite photographers and I was happy to discover that many of his great shots were taken with this lens. Also, if you shoot on a manual focus body like the F3, you'll like the solid but smooth feel of the focus ring. The 85mm comes with a metal, screw-on hood. My preference is the plastic bayonet mounts, but I find that I don't need the hood that often since this lens doesn't tend to flare. Two minor complaints about this lens: first, the bokeh is not exceptional. That's OK; I'm not a bokeh hound. But when I see the creamy out of focus specular highlights that the 85mm f/1.4 produces, sometimes I dream about spending the extra money. Second, I wish it were AF-S. But even without AF-S, it focuses faster than you'd expect. Finally, the construction is solid. I've used it heavily for two years in deserts, jungles, and glaciers (ok, and in less glamorous places like around the apartment) and it still looks brand new. In short, my favorite lens. Absolutely worth every penny 
I bought this lens when I purchased my Nikon D70s in February. I have to admit I have not used it too much. However, when I have used it, I am pleased with the results. Mostly, as I have been walking around town practicing taking photos, I have little use for the 85mm, because it's not good for "point-and-shoot" scenes. When I have taken portrait shots, however, the 85mm is very clear and creates great depth of field, which I find important. I hope this was helpful 
I have a D200 and while all the hype is around the 18-200 and others, this is one awesome lens for portraits and other closer up type photos. I read a few things that I had to research and thought I'd pass on my experience: - How is this with a D200? (ans: great. fast auto-focus. no compatibility issues) - Do you really get crisp photos and cool bokeh? (ans: absolutely) - Is 1.8 ok or do you need 1.4? (ans: I don't have a 1.4 but the 1.8 is so competent for the price and I get the crispness and shallow DOF I was looking for) - Is the shooting distance for an 85mm acceptable or do you need a 55mm so you can be closer to the subject? (ans: I really like the shooting distance for the 85mm. I really would not less distance between me and the subject) Enjoy 
It's very sharp lens. You will be wised to use it extensively on little children, they have such clear faces. Be careful when you use this lens with middle age women. It could show imperfecton in thousand fold. Again very sharp, very fast Af focusing on my Nikon F80. Ecxelent portrature lens, but be careful-women will hate you for unflattering portrature. My advise use black and white film-you will see less imperfection in prints with the same rasor sharp focus 
This is the same charger came with my digital rebel, however, I like to charge two batteries at a time. So, I bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip. The prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact, flat and easy to take along with you. It's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with. 
The battery charger is original equipment. I have used it for Canon Batteries and two different no name batteries rated as NB2L. All charged properly and were useable in my Canon ZR500. The charger is small and easy to travel with making it unnecessary to cary large quantities of batteries 
Could not be any simpler to use. Have used it a few times since it arrived and it works flawlessly. +++ Recommended for all users. Quicker and easier than the built in charger in the ZR700 camcorder 
I have been using this lens for about 2.5 years and it is an exceptional piece of equipment, especially for the price! I very rarely feel the need to get a closer image than I can achieve with this lens. It's very solidly built and I am sure it will continue to be a primary piece in my kit for years to come 
I am THRILLED with this lens's capabilities and the pictures it does. I test shot a corner of a window to determine if it would be good for my insect shots that I like so well. Well, it did great as it came but I found that I wanted to have the 1/1 capability so I bought the add-on converter and am thrilled to have added both of these necessary items for my set-up. I like nature photography the best and like to use my off summer days for hiking and finding photographs to take in perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles and subjects is what I like to specialize in. This lens will greatly enhance your experience in that 'little world' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away. I built a diffuser using a ping-pong ball over the flash so the lighting would work better. (Works great, btw). As usual, it's great Canon glass that does the trick 
I purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches. I use an original Canon Digital Rebel and the shots are really very detailed. It is easy to use in fact, I can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand-made craftsmanship of the watches. Its F2.5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge. If you own a Canon digital SLR and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you. 
I really like this lens but my results are not consistent. I think though this is more of a function of my limited skill of photography. The focal range seems very narrow but when you hit it the results are outstanding. I occasionally get images that are out of focus but again I think this is my fault. I bought this for macro work but I use it as a prime lens most of the time 
First I do not have this lens yet but I am buying it. It is reportedly an excellent lens with very little distortion along the edges (which is why I'm buying it). I will update this review after I have the lens, however, I feel that people should be warned about a big error in another well received review because it will only lead to frustration. Do not listen to John Kwok's suggestion to buy the Canon 60mm macro lens UNLESS you you own the 20d, 300d, or 350d/Rebel XT. The lens is an EF-S lens and as of September, 2005 it will ONLY fit those cameras - it has NOT been optimized for all Canon DSLR's as he states. On the other hand, the 50mm macro here will fit all Canon 35mm film cameras and all digital SLR's. 
The Canon EF 50mm f2.5 macro lens is yet another example of Canon doing a fine job catching up with the likes of Nikon, Zeiss and Leica with respect to optical design; optically it may be the best 50mm macro lens currently available for 35mm SLR film photography. I am impressed that a lens as cheap as this counts at least one aspheric lens element and an apochromatic lens design; unfortunately it is not nearly as durable a lens as the celebrated L series lens line or the Canon EF 100mm macro lens. Unless you are constantly working out in the field taking close-up photography, then the durability of this lens's lens mount and barrel should not be an issue. More importantly for the user is the quality of its images, and having read some test reports on this lens, I have no doubt that it is a capable performer. Those interested in digital macro photography may choose to look instead at the new 60mm macro lens, which is optimized for use with Canon digital SLR cameras 
I never thought a $250 lens could be so good. I have been trying to buy lenses that are light-weight for my 20D, due to a neck injury problem, and this 50mm fits the bill. Great in low light, and agree also, the bokeh is sweet. I do alot of bee chasing and manage some great macros with bees in flight with this one. All hand held. Can also take great indoor shots without flash, with a steady hand.I chose it also because it was one of the least expensive high rated canon 50mm's. It goes well with another inexpensive canon lens, the 55-200mm ef f4.5-5.6 II, which also does well outdoors, including macro. I am very pleased with both, and wouldn't part with them 
I love this camera. It's my second Canon and, at 7MP, the best value for the money I've seen. I took it to France this summer and loved the fact that I could recharge the battery overnight while my friends were constantly changing their batteries (and searching for places to buy them!). My favorite option is the "Scene" button. I don't think I'll ever try the "underwater" option, but the "night shot" and "inside shot" work fantastically. It also seems as though you can take movies until the card or battery fail - which is a huge improvement over my older Canon. Unlike a lot of newer cameras, this one has a viewfinder. A friend of mine has a Nikon that has no viewfinder and it was extremely hard to use in bright sunshine. I carried my camera in my purse without a case a few days ago in New Orleans without a problem - it worked like a charm. I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants an easy-to-use model that produces fabulous results. 
I'm by no means an expert! This is the first digital I have owned. It took me a long time because I was so used to my film camera. But I searched long and hard to find what I thought I wanted. And so far I am not disappointed. At first the size threw me because everyone else had a bigger camera and I felt it would be hard to handle to take good pics. But that's not the case. I like the feel, the size...I like to be able to throw it in my purse...It takes great pictures to use for my e-bay, and sending to family and friends. I haven't had any pictures printed from it yet, so I don't know how exactly they will come out, but I'm thinking they should be okay since my online pics have been great. I haven't had a single blurry pic, both regular and close up. The video works well...it has lots of little options I don't use..like sounds for each function, but I can change those if I want. Overall I have no complaints 
I bought this camera in February, and it really did a great job in so many different situations. Unfortunately, I lost it this past September and have been kicking myself ever since. I will be purchasing the exact same camera again. Excellent features include: easy to use small good quality (as long as they aren't EXTREMELY close) pictures I like the software that came with the camera good accessories, esp. the camera case clear LCD screen great options for picture taking Good features include: fast shutter speed, although not quite fast enough. I'd like to take more pictures at a faster repetition but cannot with this camera I recommended this camera to my best friend who is a lighting designer for retail spaces (Dolce Gabbana, for instance) and he gives it an excellent review as well, so I know it is good in all types of light and for professional purposes 
I LOVE THIS CAMERA! I bought it to keep in my diaper bag so I always have a camera with me. It's small, easy to use and takes great pictures. I recently sent a few in to have them developed and they came out great. The only recommendation I have is to purchase a larger memory card - the one it comes with only hold a few pictures 
It is working well, and it is sturdy. I dropped on the ground when playing frisby, but nothing happened 
hi i am surendranadha reddy i purchaged a CANON SD500 7.1MP . It is verygood digital camara. previously i used pantex that is also good, but in this photos are very natural and realistic. One more the Amazon price also good. Thank you surendr 
I like the picture quality and features of this camera at this price point so much, its the third one I've purchased. My family seems to be hard on cameras such that this model only seems to last for about a year or so. At that point its been banged around in my wifes purse or accidentally dropped by the kids that the telescoping mechanism for the lens stops working. In doing web research it seems to be a common problem. So if you're typically more gentle than me and my family seem to be, this is a great and easy picture taker 
I bought this camera for $249 new which marked down from the $499 retail. This was an older model as the new models had just come out. For the money this is a good camera, but I am very particular and was not blown away. The images are good, but I was expecting more vibrance. Colors are a bit weak. It will not take a focused shot indoors unless the flash is on, and the flash is way to bright for closer shots. The image is often over exposed, and I find myself placing a piece of paper over the flash to get more of a correct shot. I upgraded from a Canon A40 2 megapixel camera (AMAZING CAMERA!), and the images are very similar in quality, except the new SD500 captures them bigger, having the 7 megapixel chip, hence a little better detail. I do like the small size, and the battery lasts a long time between charges. Holds lots of pictures with the 1 gig card I purchased seperatly. The video quality is quite good for a still camera. 
I have used this charger battery package for a while now in my digital SLR, battery performance is excellent! The downside is that the charger has issues: The top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get VERY hot when charging, it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year I have had them. If you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these, and the charger is okay, just beware that it does not charge all NiMH batteries but does do most 
First Amazon thanks for the great service in delivering our item. It works fantastic. We are very satisfied with it. 
I do not have take more than one bags. This bag is big enough for everything. 
Good quality and very configurable. Fits body plus 2-3 lenses easily. Even fits my camera with a telephoto lens attached and a second backup lens 
My kit includes a Canon D60 DSLR, Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8, Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 macro USM, Sigma 100-300mm f/4, 420 EX Speedlite flash, 4 assorted filters, AAA batteries, 2 extra batteries for the D60 tripod collar. First few times I tried to fit everything in, my Sigma 100-300 did not find space. I was about to return this bag, but tonight, decided to give it another try (10th attempt). And surprise, surprise... the best configuration just came to me all of a sudden. With the Sigma lens on the bottom, stretched out to occupy the width of the bag, the 100mm and the flash fits perfectly on the remaining part of the bag's bottom. Then, a divider on top, to prevent scratching, place the D60 and the Tamron lens attached on top, and the height of the bag makes it easily possible to fit everything in, and close the hood, without stretching the bag at all. My 4 filters (jn their think cases go into the front pouch. The generous side-pockets fit my tripod collar for the 100-300, 2 spare batteries, a new and a box of 12 AAA batteries .... this means my entire kit fits perfectly, without the bag being stretched uncomfortably. I'm glad I gave it this one try 
I don't have that much stuff, but fits all my DSLR gadgets plus my camcorder. Fits - my Canon Xti with my canon 50 mm attached. - my kit lens - my new canon 70-300 IS - my panasonic video cam - minor accessories (extra batteries, cables, memory cards, etc) There are separators with velcros inside, so you can configure the bag however you want it. The only issue I have with this bag is that I wan't able to configure it to store my Xti with my 70-300 attached 
I bought this bag to use with my Canon Elura 100 Camcorder. Camcorder's these days are as small as camera, but I knew I'd need a lot of room for accessories and this bag fit the bill. I have in this bag right now: Camcorder, 5 MiniDV Tapes, Extra Battery, Head Cleaner, Extra Wide Angle Lens, External Mic, L-Bracket for mounting Mic, Lens Cleaning Kit, Remote Control, All Wires, Lens Filters. And I still have room for quite a bit more! What I love about this bag is that it's really a BIG bag that doesn't at all feel like a BIG bag - and that's a great thing to me! The inside is super configurable which is great 'cause you can set it up the way that is best for the accessories you have so that everything fits, but doesn't move around. This same bag cost almost double at Best Buy and other retail stores so it's a steal here at Amazon! I LOVE it 
This bag is great for your SLR digtial camera. It has space for your extra lens. Everything that came with you SLR camera fits in this bag. this bag is a great buy and its not that expensive 
This camera bag is just as I expected. What was written as a description fits it perfectly. Nice bag! Great response time in delivery. Thanks 
I have had this bag now for over 9 months and can honestly say it has more then surpassed my expectations. It stores everything I need when out with family or friends to catch all the action in one convenient place. In the center of the bag I have the following: 1. Rebel XT body 2. Canon 430EX Flash 3. 17mm-85mm Lens 4. 75mm-300mm Lens 5. Sony Handycam Video Recorder 6. Power plug for charging Video Recorder On the sides I store the Battery Chargers and Batteries for Flash, Camera and Video Camera, plus Tapes for the Video Camera. The front holds all the manuals for everything and a few extra Memory Cards and lens covers. Even after this, there is still space in the bag for other things. The bag has held up very well and can see no signs of wear or tear after dragging this bag all over the place for the last 9 months. 
Pros: - Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element. - Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile. 
Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shaped one and three quarters inch long offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Being so shallow and petal shaped, even this type of protection is limited. Even if the protection is limited, replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing an expensive L lens. This hood is manufactured for the Canon 24-105mm f/4.0L EF and normally comes included with the lens when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. This lens isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem. While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. PROS: Improves contrast and image quality Reduces lens flare problems Offers limited protection to the lens CONS: Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens High price for a molded piece of plasti 
This is a good Teleconverter that added 1.5x to the camera's native zoom. It adds a great degree of stability to the camera for taking those critical shots. Of course when the digital zoom is used it is very sensitive to shake and movement. Overall a good addition especially for the birds and nature shots 
I enjoy that I can get a closer shot now. Its quality is good. I am happy with the purchas 
Jim K. made a great review.....I just wanted to let you know that I agree. This is great. It is very light weight. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is that you need to zoom a bit or else you get a burnout effect (a circle where the corners are dark because it is getting the inside of the lens). That is annoying, and forces you to remove the extender when you want to take closer photos. At a distance though, it is great. Pictures come out great. I highly recommend this.....I would have given it 4.5 stars if it were an option 
Question: The Canon S2 has only 1 color - silver. I believe this telephoto converter came in only black, doesn't it look silly to have a silver camera with a long black nose? I was going to get this adaptor but I am holding back because of it's color. Instead, I am looking to find a adaptor and converter kit that comes in silver instead of black. Although I don't have this converter. Assuming that I am satisfied with its quality and featuers, I would only give it only 4.5 stars because of it's color. Anyone has any ideas 
I was surprised at the heft of this tele converter when it arrived. It comes in a pullstring pouch that offers reasonable protection in a camera bag, purse, or other similar carying case and will hold the lens while attached to the required adapter. It also comes with a lens cap for each end. The converter has a high quality look and feel throughout, and as with the lens hood included in the inexpensive adapter kit (required), the mounting threads are cut accurately enough that the lettering on the lens and hood all line up perfectly at the top of the assembly. It looks as I would expect from Canon, which is to say, instrument quality. OK, looks don't make good pictures, so here is the rest of the story. The body is made of tough, lightweight materials (FRP?, polycarbonate?), so what you feel when you take the lens out of the case is the weight of several glass elements. The glass coating is well done, as pictures are nice and contrasty. Flare and distortion are minimal, and on par with a quality SLR offering. The base lens on the S2 is fairly fast, and doesn't suffer from defects at maximum telephoto, so this converter was built to complement that quality, and it does a fine job. As a matter of fact, the converter lens is optimized to supplement only the telephoto portion of the main camera lens range, At less than moderate telephoto settings, you end up with a view of the back end of the converter lens, and not much else. Used as intended, it gives you the ability to use your 5 mp sensor to take spectacular 650 mm telephoto shots with incredible sharpness, color, and detail. There is no comparison to digital zoom at all. This lens alows you to "reach out and touch someone" while using every pixel your sensor has available, and without adding eyeball noticable distortion at all. On top of that, the image stabilizer in the camera lets you shoot 650 mm telephoto pictures handheld in reasonable lighting conditions. Check out the price of a 600 mm image stabilized lens for an SLR and get back to me after you recover. Sure, having a $5,000 SLR body/lens combo will win the comparison at a lab bench, and might be a stop faster (only on the high end though), but the S2/teleconverter combo lets you take far better and more creative pics than the classic 35 mm with a mirror tele lens can ever offer. Further cropping the photos on your computer later will simply amaze you. For the price, it's a must have item. It also catches the action on the field in movie mode from the nosebleed seats at the stadium. It is a big lens, and will make your S2 look as though it must be an SLR, but the combination of S2 and teleconverter is light enough (compared to an SLR) to carry all day long in a desert without a problem. It offers the digicam prosumer quality glass reach that used to be reserved for higher end SLR's. For what it adds to your photographic range, it's cheap, too. One suggestion. The lens adapter/lens hood combo you need to mount any of the three converter lenses Canon offers is dirt cheap. The combo sells for around 26 bucks everywhere. The adapter attaches to the camera with a push button release bayonet mount, is quick to change, and feels very secure. The adapter also takes 58 mm filters of all kinds, and I like to keep a UV filter mounted on my camera for the improvement in contrast it offers, and to protect the camera lens from damage (I dropped my S2 this past weekend, and the Hoya UV filter took the fall. It dented, but didn't break). Anyway, because they are so cheap, I suggest getting one for the S2, and each converter lens you buy. That way, you can switch lenses in an instant, and keep the front of each lens protected with it's own UV filter and/or hood. Oh yes. A good circular polorizer filter really kills glare, and brings out contrast with any lens under many typical shooting conditions. The tele-converter lens does not have front threads to mount filters (most don't), but I made an adapter by mounting a 72 mm UV filter to a 7/16" long cardboard masking tape core with an inside diamerter that slipped snugly over the end of the tele-converter. Prior to gluing the UV filter to the tube section, I painted the tube flat black. Now, the circular polorizer (or any other 72 mm filter attaches to the adapter, looks like it belongs there, and works perfectly. I think you will enjoy this converter as much as I do. Good shooting.

This hood does a more than adequate job at controlling flare on the EF 100mm f/2. Additionally, the hood can provide protection to those who 1) do not adorne their lenses with UV/SKY filters, or 2) do so adorne them! The lens is already a capable performer; it is moreso with the hood. The price is a bit steep, but that does not effect its performance. Thus, my rating stands 
It's easy to attach -- and detach -- and works well with most (but not all) of my 58mm lens. It does cut down on glare, and let's face it, the hood makes your lens look a bit more dynamic, while also protecting it from the elements 
I bought this hood for Canon's 85mmf1.8 lens, one incredible lens. Years ago I went to a lecture by Ernst Wilde, MR. Hasseblad himself, where he showed the difference that a lens hood would make on a Hasseblad lens. Since then I have always used them faithfully on every lens I own. The longer the lens, the more efective the lens hood can be if it is specifically designed for that lens. This is the hood Canon has for their medium telephoto lenses, the 85f1.8, 100usm macro, and 135mmf2.8 lenses. The hood will protect your lens from dust, scratches, damage, while at the same time preserving the maximum contrast your lens can deliver. This differs from a filter, that will take away from the inherit lens sharpness and contrast. A analogy is wearing a baseball cap which will improve your vision and protect your eyes from cataracts, while not distorting your vision like sunglasses will 
The Kodak PH160 Media Cartridge Kit is the best bargain around! You get 4 cartridges plus paper in each pack. I have used more paper than ink! Thank you Kodak for such a money saving kit 
Very convenient. Easy to use. Paper and cartridge matched up for quantities is a smart idea. Sometimes the printer jams but easy to clear. I find the colors a bit dark and skin tones not balanced to be the most attractive. If they can work on these items this would be a fantastic device and I would probably keep several for office, home, garage, travel...and use a lot of media cartridges too. I am one of those that takes 800-1000 pictures on a two week vacation so I really would use the heck out of these cartridges if the image quality were better. I usually make 3 or 4 copies of each print to mail to friends that are in the pictures 
I find these PH160 packages of toner cartridges and photo paper to be the best deal for me. I take a LOT of pictures and print them off to send as postcards to friends all over the USA. This way I have plenty of the photo paper on hand and a good supply of the toner cartridges and don't have to constantly run to the store to buy a single toner cartridge and package of photo paper. I do wish however that you could just buy the toner cartridges without the photo paper as I always have more paper than what I can use with the number of toner cartridges 
This product works really well, and the price was great. I am always pleased with the quality of Kodak 
We love this product.Took me minutes to hook up. So easy to use. I understand total cost of printing is few Cents more than what you can get in Costco.But.its the ease of use AT HOME!Specially if U have guests at home....and you wanna give instant photos...hmm....Cosco/Walmart....going on a Christmas day.....I dont think so!!!! My guests love it....when we give them photos....right after the party! Everybody gets a kick out of it! Amazon.....GOOG SERVICE!ON TIME!!! N 
I can't believe how advanced things have become. The quality of the pictures that are printed on the Kodak Easy share media cartridge. 
Kodak has made printing pictues as simple as 123. The paper cartridge snaps in place quite easily. It can be removed quickly and stored out of the way because the paper is protected in its own tray with convenient lid. This is high quality paper and has a protective coating that is applied to the photo to give it many years of durability. I thought the price was competative with other methods of printing with photo paper 
Purchased a printer dock and camera bundle, from a local office supply store for $100. It only came with a 10 picture sample cartridge, so I purchsed this from amazon. Amazon had the best price around on this item and free shipping. It works great. No complaints. The paper is not quite as shiny and or as thick as the epson photo glossy paper that I still use for some pictures, but works well for my classroom, to give to my students. The pictures do not run like some inkjet pictures do if you accidentally drip water on them 
I love this product, because I love the camera and the printing dock. I have been using them for 2 years. My daughter-in -law and son got theirs a little earlier because of the arrival of their first child. I saw it and had to have one of these marvelous things that I could do by myself at home. I think she discovered your site and that you sold the product. We have both purchased from you a few times. Thanks for the reasonable film prices that have allowed me to take more pictures and copy for my friends and relatives 
Now, this isn't the fastest card on the market. But it is a solid, reliable card. The camera itself is the bottle kneck, and typically not this card. However, if you are using a Canon DSLR of a recent flavor, I would check if it needs to be RMA'd. A known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images. scary. However, I've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or Rebel XT. I've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my PD70X, and definately not with my Rebel XT 
I also have the SB-600 and this product, the SB-800, is much better - and worth the extra $100. It is much easier to use since it has a simple menu structure and not the wierd button combo selections of the SB-600. The flash output is better, the recycle time is better and you can use the flash as a commander for other wireless flashes. Also the extra battery holder for a fifth battery reduces recycle time further and never comes off my unit. The diffusion head is also included so you don't have to buy a separate one from Stofen... works great 
I purchased this Speedlight for my D70s. It is easy to take out of the box and fire up. But it's capable of a lot more than your standard portraiture and vacation shots. I have been using this unit for in-store photography and it's worked wonders. The included filters help balance out the horrific fluorescent lighting found in most stores. While it's highly intuitive, I can also control it's output. This is an essential part of any Nikon package 
I would not be able to imagine shooting without the SB-800, it's just so integral to my photography. My only gripe is the TTL preflashes which can cause some people to blink of half-blink by the time the main flash goes off. But you can easily get around this by using FV lock. Fill flash is perhaps the most excellent function of the SB-800. I usually stop it down about by -1.3EV to -1.7EV to get imperceptable results 
Nikon designed this unit to exploit the possibilities of their latest digital SLRs while still being compatble with their oldest F-series cameras. The SB-800 is more expensive than the SB-600, but it gives you more control and more light. You may find more light to be critical if you want to use bounce flash to soften shadows. I would have given the SB-800 five stars if the user manual had been a little better. Nikon obviously tried very hard to provide good documentation, and to make the user interface as intuitive as possible. But, a unit with so many features and modes inevitably will require effort to learn, and will present cases where you are working against the built in automation. Expect to make a large number of experimental shots if you really want to learn how to use this unit. My chief plea to Nikon would be for a more straight forward explanation that cameras like the D50 DO NOT HAVE TTL FLASH. The so called i-TTL uses pre flashes and computation to set up a calculated flash rather than a real time measurement during the exposure to quench the flash. One would normally expect the same result, but not if a slave flash is used. One of the beauties of the SB-800, however, is that it can be used as a slave unit using its own sensor to determine when the master unit is firing, even if (as in the case of a D50 using its built in flash) the camera and the SB-800 are not communicating i-TTL info via IR pulses 
Here is my point. When you buy a digital SLR, most likely in a couple years there will a newer model available with some better features for the same price. But lenses as well as flashes a not changing that fast and keep value much longer. So from a purely financial prospective, it's always better to invest more in the long lasting lenses and flashes and less in the DSLR body. Another point. Most people don't need all advanced feature of the modern flashes and can probably easily survive without them. But also almost everyone sooner or later finds him/herself in a situation, when the place is just too dark and too big. So it's more likely you'll need just more raw power then any of the advanced features. So the bottom line, since a general purpose flash is usually a long term investment, if you have a choice, try to get the most powerful one 
Bought it together with the D50, 6 month ago. Simply the best choice for digital Nikon SLR, superior compared to the high-end flashes for the analog Nikon cameras. Within a range of up to 60feet this flash will brighten very smooth, no red eyes, the press will focus perfectly. But you need the 5th battery, and you better spent the money for high-end batteries, don't use "consumer-type" rechargeable ones. They will last for a very short time only, not enough to fill a 1GB card! 
For those of you who have the D200 and are wondering if you need this flash consider this. That with the D200's built in flash acting as commander you can use the SB800 off camera. Just set it up on it's included stand and coordinate the flash and the camera conrols and you now have the ability to capture portraits that look professional. Set it up behind your subject, off to the side, angle bounce for anywhere. I am sure you get the idea. Just one more reason why the Nikon is a great value. Think about what it would cost you to have similiar capability with your Canon. This flash may seem high priced but it is the most sophisticated unit on the market in my opinion. Good luck! 
I do have to say, being a semi-pro photographer, this one item has made a vast difference in many of my shots. It has allowed me to get studio like shots (to an extent) without having to use those giant studio flashes that cost thousands of dollars. I was able to just set up a few hot lights and use the SB-800 off camera thanks to that amazingly wonderfull wireless feature and got great quality shots for what I needed to do. Also, being a concert photographer, in low light areas this works great especially since most tour managers don't take to highly of Flash use, it allows me to be farther back and get a great shot since I know have a little more fill light to work with. The SB-800 I do have to say is by far one of the few products that you won't regret paying a high price for. I had originally thought of getting the 600 and decided to go all out and get the 800 after reading all the featuers it has that the SB-600 doesnt. This product, coupled with my D70 and DR-6 right angle viewfinder (another great investment you should all look into) give me so many great shots, I do have to say the only design flaw about the SB-800 is that I can't use the DR-6 while the flash is on the camera unless I buy a bracketing system. Most of the time though, When I am useing the DR-6 I am at an angle where the pop-up works just fine but there have been a few times that I wish I could use the 800 as well. So for those who are unsure between this and the SB-600, go with this product. Now all I have to do is find a better lens then my Sigma 28-300 and I am all set. Anyone know where to find a good deal on the 18-200mm Nikor Lens? If so someone (if there is a way) please email or contact me I have a myspace search my company Hope this helps at least one person Brad Premier Image 
Just bought my first SLR (D50) and my first external flash (SB-800 AF). I didn't know what to expect, but I was amazed! I could take the flash into a very dark (mostly candle lit) and large (40'x65') room and take a shot that looked like daylight. As far as the speed, its amazing - I can shoot off 12 shots in continuous mode on my camera and the flash will keep up (sometimes it will miss a shot or two - still trying to figure that one out). So far, I couldn't be more pleased 
Nice intermediate level flash, works great within its perameters 
I'm an amateur photographer, with mediocre skills. This flash makes all my photos look better vs the built-in, with little to no intervention on my part. I use it with a Digital Rebel. I like that the flash varies in intensity, depending on ambient. Time between flashes is reasonably quick (particularly when ambient doesn't require a full flash). To avoid washed out faces, I'd always gotten accustomed to bouncing the flash off walls/ceiling (on my old camera setup). I've learned that I don't need to do that with the 420EX, and almost always keep it directly pointed at subjects (unless I'm trying to purposely create shadows across people's faces). I also seem to get much less redeye vs built in 
I bought this flash to use on my Canon Rebel XT. The first thing I noticed was that without even reading the instructions I was able to get much better results on pictures taken indoors. Being able to bounce the flash off the white ceilings provided much better color contrasts to the built in flash. Even when I set my camera to shoot quick pictures in succession the flash did not let me down. It did not need anytime to recharge at all. I recently just came back from vacation and took a lot of outdoor evening shots. Most of the pictures came back with great results. The only dissappointment I have is that when taking shots from further distance than I normally would, the pictures came back darker than I would've liked. So, to compensate for this I adjusted the flash exposure on my camera and although it was an improvement it was a hassle taking several test shots before getting it right. Another problem I have with the flash is the battery cover. It's flimsy and I find it awkward to open and close at times. I always feel like I'm gonna snap it off by accident. Overall I am happy. It's a good flash for the price you pay. The battery life is good. I still haven't even had to recharge the batteries and I've almost taken 200 shots with it. My low light picture have improved dramatically by investing in an external flash. Anyone with a decent camera should never use the built in flash. The difference is night and day 
All my life I have seen myself and especially babies for some reason be a victim of redeye. I bought this right before my son was born and have taken nothing but beautiful pictures ever since and haven't had a single red eye no matter how light someone's eyes are. Another great benefit/feature is to be able to bounce the flash off of the ceiling or wall to avoid ghost face (to go along with the devil eye) It takes BEAUTIFUL pictures even in dimly lit rooms without a smidge of graininess. (see one of the two pictures of my son indoors in the customer images for this product) We use this with the Canon digital Rebel XT 
This flash is working great for me. It has an amazing recycle time. I have been able to easily fire off multiple shots indoors in low light without missing a beat. I have also used it in a completely dark room, and all worked great. I don't like the locks on the bounce head, it is necessary to press the release on the side prior to tilting. Just a minor annoyance 
First off, this lens works wonderfully with Canon's 20D, 30D and 5D. The image stabilization gives the photographer a serious edge. In my experience, when the IS is active, I'm able to shoot at a much lower speed, without having any blurring. Throughout the range of the lens, image sharpness is excellent, although a little soft when you zoom near 300. Otherwise, from 75 to 280 aprox. image quality is astonishing. I have shot at weddings, sport events, low-light conditions and very in cold climate conditions and the lens performed flawlessly. The ability of focussing manually is a plus. Automatic focus is always accurate. Just a few times in more than 3000 shots has the lens slowed a bit when focusing, but I must say that the objets were moving. The weight of the lens is ok, not too heavy, construction seems according to Canon standards. When shooting in particular situations, the silent USM mechanism is really a welcome feature. Overall, a very nice lens for the serious and amateur photographer 
I get frustrated by all the negative reviews this lens gets on the web. Yes, the AF is slow and the IS is first generation. Yes, it's not totally sharp and it's slow at the long end. But what other $440 (inc shipping) 300mm lenses with IS is there? * The DO costs $1100 and is shorter but heavier and the optics are not much better. * The 100-400L costs $1400, is much larger and just as slow. * The 70-200/4L is 50% more expensive, only 200mm and lacks IS. * The new 70-300 IS that replaces this lens will probably be a better lens than this version but it costs 50% more and currently (Oct 05) is still not available in the US. The 75-300mm IS is my zoo lens so I don't use it nearly as much as my standard zoom for everyday photography. On my Digital Rebel with its 1.6x crop factor this lens is the equivalent of 120-480mm in 35mm terms, and with the image stabilization feature it makes for some exotic optics. Play to this lens' strengths (middle of the aperture range [don't be afraid of higher ISO settings to achieve this] and not the extreme long end) and your images will be able to be printed at 8x10 without an issue. You're not going to be able to easily track a speeding cheetah with this lens but that is not what this lens is for. It's also unfair to compare this lens to L series alternatives - if you can afford L series lenses then use them but don't cut those of us down without your disposable income just for enjoying this lens. If you own this lens and you want to improve the quality of your images remember to always use a lens hood. Also, the IS is amazing but there are limits; a monopod will improve image sharpness no end. But both these tips apply equally to most lenses both cheaper and more expensive. This lens has earned a permanent place in my camera bag. It's cheap enough and light enough to carry just in case you might need a strong telephoto. The IS really works and is really useful on a telephoto with this kind of zoom range. Don't be put off or intimidated by lens snobs and line counters. This lens also holds its value well; buy it, and use it, now while you're saving for your L dream telephoto and you will be able to sell it for not much less than you paid for it when the time comes to upgrade. When that time comes you just might decide that you want to keep the 75-300mm IS around as well. This lens is great value and very useable even if it is not a great lens. 
The camera handles very well - it's light and drives my Zoom lens and 18-55mm lens beautifully. I get professional photographs and can use it all day without suffering from heavy weight, which it does not have. The view finder is excellent and the readout on the back of the camera is extremely helpful, showing photos as they are taken - with zoom on the back screen, which immediately gives me the idea of the photo I want to use in my books. I say this is an outstanding lens and camera. 
Yes due to be released in Sept 05 is an updated NEW version of this lens. It will be a 70-300mm f/4-5.6 lens with a new IS set up which can be viewed at the Canon Website. The Canon item number is 0345B002. The MSRP of the NEW VERSION LENS is $649.99 I have the older version 75-300mm III USM w/out IS and I have had nothing but good things to say about that lens! (I only paid $189.99 for it) Can't wait for this new version to come out 
For anyone considering this lens, according to Canon's site, there will be a newer model to supersede this one which will out perform it. Item # 0345B002 will be a 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens available at sometime in 9/05 
This lens is outstanding. Speed and sharpness are top-notch. I use this lens for a wide array of situations and it has always delivered impressive results. Best lens in it's class at a reasonable price. It's well built, sturdy, and not so heavy so it's relatively easy to carry around. Canon really impressed me with this lens. I use it with my EOS system (traditional and digital cameras). 
Owned 2 weeks: The only thing to cause me to stop short of 5 stars is the weight of the lens. Stabilization is great and worth every dime. Don't even think about the other 75-300mm non-IS version, it is junk - I tried it. You can hand hold this lens at 300 mm at 1/60!! No kidding. Focus is fast and accurate with my Digital Rebel - almost no hunting like on the other 75-300mm. You *must* get a skylight filter to protect the front element. I'll update this review after a few months' use. 
Best camera I've ever owned.It has features found on larger SLR's such as shutter speed red-eye reduction.The several shoot modes such as portrait allows for close ups as well as a scenery mode which allows for sharp vivid photos of foilage as well as sunsets.A marvelous little camera and the size being slightly bigger than a pack of cigarettes allows you to take this anywhere without the bulk of some of the SLR's and their required lens.Too many features to list here.Try one for yourself you'll be amazed 
I love this camera! I did a lot of reading-up and price-checking before I bought this item, and I'm delighted with the quality of product and value for money. This was my first 'own camera' and I've had almost zero camera experience, so to find myself taking the most amazing photos and being able to edit/add text/e-mail them - well - WOW! I've been stunned by the results this camera has given, all within about a month of purchase. The basic handbook had me taking quality 'normal' photo's within 24 hours and, using this handbook I've progressed into some fantastic close-up stuff, and some fun stuff too - get your spouse to dress up for the sepia shots and have a good laugh!! I've had enormouse fun learning with this camera - and I've got loads more to learn and I feel that some good camera work is now within my grasp. This has required a modicom of concentration and diligence, but it's paid off, and is precisely what I had hoped for. I found the batteries that came with the camera were almost useless, but that your quality name-brand batteries give excellent life - also, if you plan on taking more than about 15 pics at a time, you will want a memory card. Oh Yeah! I'm an 'old bird' of 53 years, so if I can do this, ANYONE can :o 
I bought this camera as a gift for my 16 yr old daughter who takes lots of fun pictures of her friends.Her photos are great quality. This is a dependable camera, and takes the abuse a teenager gives it. I love it for all those reasons besides the great pics 
I just finished the first set of pics with this machine and was surprised at the amazing sharpness and the accuracy of the autofocus, not to mention the deapth of field when compared to our older Canon digital camera. Don't be fooled by the low price, however. The 16MB card is a joke, and the batteries are not rechargable. It is best to get a 1GB memory card along with a battery charger pack right away. The price is still very reasonable for such a high quality machine 
I bought this camera for my 10 year old daughter. She is thrilled to have her own camera and has taken may vacation pics for the family. I would reccommend for all beginning photographers. Great price range with all the options. Plus easy to use 
From a pure image quality standpoint, this lens will not please the pixel peepers. On the wide end of the zoom, which I personally use more often than the telephoto end, this lens is not very sharp, and it suffers from fairly bad distortion. Worse than that, for me, are the chromatic abberations; this lens is quite prone to significant CA when shot at the wide end, which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness. Given the price of this lens, one should expect a higher level of optical performance. The maximum aperture of this lens is not very large, being f/4 on the wide end, and f/5.6 on the telephoto end. The image stabilization makes up for this some, as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise, but, let's be honest here; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod. The small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder, which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark (using a tripod). Yet, I still gave this very imperfect lens four stars, and this is not without reason. First of all, the focal length range is quite handy. It isn't a mega-zoom that does everything, however, it covers the most often used focal length ranges, and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations. The little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion, and it's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end, but zoomed in, it's quite good. I have printed as large as 20x30" using this lens on a Digital Rebel, and have no qualms with the results. Yes, there are sharper lenses out there, but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print. This lens has ring USM, which enables it to focus very quietly, and very quickly, whereas the slightly cheaper (and F2.8) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison. If you want to use this lens indoors, you are best off getting a flash to go with it, such as a 430EX. The lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting, or during the day, but won't give you good results in low light with no flash. If you will be shooting in lower light situations (people in particular), Tamron and Sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with F2.8 apertures, and I would recommend those lenses over this one. If you'd prefer the extra telephoto range, the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field (instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f/4, for instance, without image stabilization, you could use f/11 on this lens, and get a sharp picture with better depth of field. This is even more useful in the close focus range - while this isn't a true macro lens, if you take closeup photos without a tripod, you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field, and the IS helps with that quite a bit. Overall, I've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens. If you like to worry about splitting hairs, and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer, this lens is likely to dissapoint you. If, however, you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded, useful lens, then I'd recommend it, however, would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options, as they are also great lenses, and do offer a somewhat better value 
At the time of this writing, there is something wrong with the product shot on the Amazon site: It makes the lens look much shorter than it is in reality. It's not a large or heavy lens at all, but it's not _that_ short. I've had mine (part of a 20D kit) for about a year, during which I've taken maybe 4000 frames or so with that particular lens. The lens still appears as solid as it was on day 1, so no complaints in that department. The image stabilization (IS) feature works quite well and is surprisingly silent (far more so than the IS system on the EF 70-300mm IS). That said, for a good fraction of the focal length range, IS is a relatively minor (but still useful) benefit of this lens. Autofocus (AF) speed is okay: Better than the kit lens that came with the original Digital Rebel I used to own, but not as fast as some other lenses I have (all non-L). AF accuracy is fine on my copy. Optically, my concern is primarily sharpness. In that department, the lens seems only marginally better than the 18-55mm kit lens that came with the original Digital Rebel (and which can be bought for close to $100, I believe). It's often worth turning off IS to improve things, ironically. Still, it's not awful. I haven't found vignetting, distortion, flare, and aberrations to be significant hindrances. In part, that probably due to a workflow that includes DxO Pro for the images I care about. Overall, I think this is still a pretty good choice for a lens to keep by default on a Canon EF-S camera (30D, 20D, or a Digital Rebel variant). The optical performance over the lower-end EF-S 18-55mm lens is not _that_ great, but the feature set may justify the premium. The higher end EF-S 17-55/2.8 IS is another alternative if you're willing to double your investment and change lenses to get the longer focal range: Its imaging quality and the larger aperture are certainly desirable. Tamron and Sigma have some offerings in this range too, but I'm not at all familiar with them 
i have had so much fun with this lense and managed to take some pretty incredible pics. i use this lense for probably 95% of pics. i have 10-22mm, 28-300mm, and 100-400mm, all of which take great pics but this 17-85mm works great for general use 
I got this lens with my 30D and have found it to be a useful walkaround lens, able to handle just about any situation I threw at it, other than very low-light situations. Even in dim illumination it was able to function fairly well, thanks to the image stabilization, which let me shoot at shutter speeds as slow as 1/4 second hand-held. I wasn't thrilled with the barrel distortion at the wide end of the zoom range, but I was able to fix this using Photoshop's Lens Correction adjustment with no problem. It's simply an additional post processing step that's necessary 
If you are only going to buy one lens for your 10, 20 or 30D then buy this lens. I haven't seen a better general purpose lens out there. The EF-S 17-85mm takes great photos, especially in an action oriented situation where you need to run around a lot and get a variety of different shots at different distances. Some have complained that the lens is overpriced. I agree that for the price, it would have been nice to get a hood and carry bag thrown in, but I can say that Canon has impeccable warranty service. I got sand inside my lens and the autofocus quit while I was shooting photos of military helicopters landing in Iraq. I got the lens repaired and shipped back to me within 30 days - in Baghdad in the middle of a war. I was able to speak to a human tech fairly easily and they even replaced something I clearly broke through heavy use that wasn't covered under warranty. The repaired lens works perfectly. If you're looking for a reasonable alternative on a budget try this lens: Sigma Zoom Super Wide Angle AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC Macro Autofocus Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras Bear in mind that if you have issues and you're using non-Canon lenses on a Canon body, the support you can get from Canon will be limited 
This lens is very versatile, offering good wide angle to a good head-and-shoulders portrait length. It's internal focusing, which helps with speed and close-focusing performance, and has image stabilizer for better low-light performance. The IS can be of a particular benefit to those that shoot in darker open areas, like wedding photographers in churches. The IS, combined with a flash, can allow use to get more background detail for indoor events. No longer do we have to accept dark, dungeon like backgrounds! Ideally, the lens would be a little bit brighter (say, f4 at the top end), and a bit heavier built. But then again, we could have that for $1,000 more 
I got this lens to replace the kit lens that came with my Canon EOS 30D. This lens is definitely a more "substantial " lens than the kit lens. Even though the outer housing is plastic, it has a metal mount and seems very durable and sturdy. The IS really helps to improve the image quality induced by my unsteady hand. The USM is very fast and quiet. I have read accounts of this lens not being able to lock on, but I have not had any issues with it in varying (including low) lighting conditions. I know the lens supports FTM focus, but I have not tried it yet. I like the focal length range on this lens. At 17mm even with the 1.6x multiplier, the angle is very wide. The only drawback to this lens for me is at 17mm there is significant barrel distortion. My test shots my next shot was at 24mm and the distortion was completely gone at this focal length. It's not a showstopper though since it is easily corrected in Photoshop. Of all the lenses I plan to get, (Sigma 30mm 1.4, Canon EF 50mm 1.8 II, and the Canon EF 70-300mm IS USM), this will most likely be the lens I keep on the camera most of the time, using the others as opportunities warrant 
Got it two days ago, and can't say how much I love it. My camera fits perfectly, and I even put my video camera on. Although it doesn't have wheels, I can move the head around in any direction and make it stiff easily. I love the double extensions in the legs and then the neck extensions for the minor adjustments. 
I purchased this tripod from 47th Street Photo through Amazon.com. The tripod appeared to arrive in good shape, except that the operating instructions were not included. I immediately emailed 47th Stree Photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment. I asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions. They did not respond to my email, so a few days later I emailed them again. Once again, no response. I then emailed Amazon.com, and informed them of the missing instructions and the non-responses from 47th Street Photo. No response from Amazon either! As far as the tripod goes, it appears to be a very good value for the money. I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because, due to the missing operating instructions, I cannot be certain I have properly checked out all of its features. However, I am certain that both 47th Street Photo and Amazon.com rate zero stars for customer service. I will use neither one again 
I bought 2 of these to carry a camera support to be suspended over a treadmill for filming from above. I love the fact that they can extend to 70". They are very sturdy and with the hook on the central post I could hang a sandbag for additional support. Furthermore, the support beams from each leg to the central post are attached to a central ring that can tighten to change the size of the base of support as measured by the distance between legs of the tripod. This is extremely helpful when you have limited floor space and tight or cramped corners. With the addition of sandbags, this narrow base of support can still be quite stable. The additional bubble levels on the stand are enormously helpful on rough terrain. The locking mechanims on the legs are plastic, however and are thus not very good for outdoor, dusty conditions. They are very much like the Samsonite 3751 with the same camera release mechanism, locking legs, bubble levels, extendable center post, changeable size of base of support--the differences are: cheaper, greater extension, hook on center post, and carrying case 
I am 6ft tall and this is such a perfect tripod for someone who is a beginning/novice photographer for occasional to moderate use (would be my guess). My fortï¿½ is post-production, as I am a graphic designer and needed something to use with my new dig camera. I did a lot of research for tripods and this seemed to have what I needed for my usage. The plastic clips concern me somewhat with durability for the long haul, but I would love to be surprised and that is just my nerves and luck talking. How can you beat the price regardless? I am so happy with this tripod so far. I love how tall it is for me particularly and how easy it is to use. I did so much research online and found this 70" one and said "screw it" I am tired of looking and bought it. I knew I needed something that accomodated for my height and there isn't a whole lot out there for us tall folks that have decent ratings and is in the hundred and below dept. I didn't have the pesos to make another "hundred+" purchase and took a risk here when I rated the cost versus quality (in my head). I feel as though I have won this battle for now. I like the two "levels" (that i have noticed) to make sure I am squared up on this piece of equipment. Equipment has a smooth pan and I will be using it for my own photo work, video tours for my husband's realtor work and recreation/family photos. I am excited to use this more with my dig Rebel. Legs extend easily. Metal (light weight) body with plastic clips and pieces. Comes with a black bag to hold your tripod also. Easy snap-off piece to remove your digital camera and to attach. In fact I just leave it always on my camera as it expedites the process when I am in a hurry. Tripod feels quite sturdy with my Rebel attached. I think this is a really good-looking tripod. It is so SO light weight and portable. I love that it is NOT clunky and loud to assemble when pulling it straight out of the trunk/car for quickly assembly. I would've liked to seen a manual for recommended usage and ways of maximizing longevity of the product, but I am over it and the product is great so far. (revise 10-09-06) Still LOVE LOVE this tripod. I use it ALL the time. So easy to use and it is SO lightweight and I can just toss it in the trunk. So quick to set up too. Love it ... it ROCKS (from a tall gal). : 
I bought this tripod with the camera bag as a duo deal....When they say Professional, they mean professional. It's a large tripod, easy to telescope out and back again, but heavier and longer, and thicker than other tripods I've used. It does appear to be well made and very sturdy. 
I needed this tripod to use with my 20X50 binoculars since the least movement with 20X magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field. This tripod works well for that use. It is sturdy, has lots of features and is reasonably priced. However, if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars, a right angle adapter will be needed. I found one on eBay for a few dollars. 
I purchased this as a gift for my brother-in-law. He's over 6 ft tall and wanted a tripod that he didn't have to bend over to use. I couldn't find one locally, and was very happy to find this one online. He's very happy with his gift! Highly recommended 
I received the tripod ahead of the expected schedule. I've been looking at tripods in stores in and around the greater Boston area. You can't get a better tripod for the money. In fact, you can't get anything "decent" for under $40-50 and even then I'm not sure you will get something this good. I had it shipped to my job and a few guys in the office (which I didn't know) had purchased a tripod in the past and where really impressed when I told them I only paid $25 for it. Conclusion: is the tripod perfect, NO. The head looks a little like plastic. But it has nice rubber feet and rubber grip in addition to everything listed on the website. This tripod is perfect for the beginner to enthusiast photographer. 
I was a little hesitant to purchase this tripod because of the low price. The last cheap tripod I bought was lightweight and wobbly. I am very pleased with the performance of this tripod. I wasn't expecting Bogen type quality, but its good enough. It's lightweight, and surprisingly sturdy. I would recommend this tripod to a friend 
This grip is a great value for the price paid. The batteries alone are worth the money spent. I've banged this around for a week out on the rugged Bruce Peninsula and had no problems with it. I would recommend this to anyone needing a grip. The money you save you can put towards your next lens 
I'm a loyal canon fan who only has 4 Canon branded lenses (though I had a great Sigma 70-300).. That being said, I'm a huge fan of the Opteka grip. The canon is just not worth the extra money. Excellent build quality on it, and the batteries that it came with work very well (more maH than the std battery). I had heard some complaints about how far you had to depress the shutter release on the grip -- it is further than the camera, but very usable, and since purchasing I've heard similar complaints from users of the canon grip. Save the $ on the grip, get the opteka and get other accessories... You wont regret i 
This is the same as the Canon grip, made in the same factory. I don't know how they can get away with it, but it's the consumer's gain here. Through in 2 batteries and your over a hundred bucks ahead---to spend on all those lenses you'll end up getting for the XTi/400D. 
We traded up from the original Rebel to the XTi. This was the first add-on we purchased and has been GREAT! The battery grip adds some balance and overall sturdy-feeling to the Rebel...especially, the slightly smaller XT and XTi bodies. Good stuff, no regrets 
I know it sounds too good to be true, I've read too many reviews where people say that "I never knew how I ever took pictures without this grip," but it's the truth. The first thing I noticed was the vertical handle, it's amazing. You can shoot vertical shots with one hand! All of the buttons you need are on the grip, the shutter button, wheel, and the two buttons on the top right of the XT. Installation, it's a joke, don't even read the manual. You have to charge the batteries, but in the mean time you can put in your regular Canon battery, or 6 AAs because this comes with a AA shell. Think of it this way, the XT is a baby...it's easy to hold if you have small hands; I don't, I knew the camera was small, and I decided to buy this really so I could have a better handle on it, the extra battery life was whipping on the cake. I really don't know how I could stand to hold the camera without this grip. Don't spend extra money on Canon's model, this one is perfect 
I bought the Opteka Battery Pack Grip for my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi, and was a bit leary about the considerably lower price than the Canon brand battery pack grip. I am pleased to report that the Opteka grip has met my expectations. PROS The grip fits extremely well on the Rebel XTi. It even comes with a convenient place to store the battery compartment lid (which must be removed to insert the grip into the camera. Removing the lid is an easy procedure). Attaching the grip is quick and easy, with a large, serrated wheel to tighten the grip against the camera bottom. The finish on the grip is different than that on the Canon-brand grip. The Opteka has a thin, rubbery, texturized non-slip insert layer over the front, bottom and back. The Canon grip's rubbery insert is smooth and looks more "finished." My only concern about the Opteka insert is that it shows signs that it may not stay perfectly attached to the grip, and will likely need a touch of cement in the future. Not a big deal, though. The vertical shooting buttons on the grip (exposure bracket, A-E lock, Auto Focus point selection, selector wheel and shutter release) are, as far as I can tell, identically placed like those on the Canon grip. All work like they are supposed to. The grip comes with an "On-Off" slide so you can turn off the vertical shooting buttons when they are not needed. This prevents accidentally activating one of the buttons or taking a picture if they are inadvertently pressed while shooting horizontal. The battery compartment in the grip is very easy to remove and insert batteries. Although I haven't used it yet, the optional AA battery insert looks easy to use, and is good to have in emergencies. The two NB-2LH batteries that came with the grip seem to be OK, and charged up just fine. With the battery that came with the camera, I now have 3 batteries to use. More than enough for the number of pictures I take during a typical shoot. The grip certainly improves the handling and feel of the XTi, which comes with a too-small grip for many hands. Personally, I like the additional heft and mass the Opteka grip gives the camera, although some may object to the additional weight. CONS This is a very minor point, but worth pointing out. The shutter release button on the Opteka grip is a bit "mushy." What I mean is that it is not always easy to tell when you have pressed the shutter releae halfway down to activate auto focus or metering. There is a noticable tactile difference between pressing the shutter release down on the camera, and the shutter release on the grip. It's as if the spring underneath the camera's shutter release button is a bit stiffer than the one for the grip. However, if you use the viewfinder to determine whether you have achieved focus or not, then the little bit of mush in the grip shutter release won't make no never mind. BOTTOM LINE Would I recommend this grip to a friend? Yes. Would I buy another one if the need arises? Yes 
it was shipd fast and is a verygood buy for the money look the same as the more expensive canon one plus the batterys are good brand i think but it realy up to you the buyer ihave a canon rebel and it fit verrysnug 
I read rave reviews about the Opteka battery grip being manufactured to the same specs as the Canon grip but at a fraction of the price, so I knew I couldn't go wrong with it. It came with two 3rd party batteries as well for only $20 more, so what did I have to lose? Let me start off by saying I have experience with 3rd party batteries and they are usually a waste of money as they are horrible from a performance standpoint. Not these however, I have taken a few hundred pictures with about 20% flash and the battery meter is still full. Great value overall. The grip really does balance out the small size of the Rebel XT and always stays on my camera. It does add considerable weight to the camera however, but nothing overbearing 
I have both the Canon version of the grip and this version. They are identical. I have two Rebel XTs and they work great. I like them for the feel it gives holding the camera. The camera was small in my hands and this makes it perfect. If you are thinking of buying accessories for the Rebel XT, this should be one of them. The grip holds two batteries, which gives you way more shooting time. I highly recommend this 
My husband bought me this camera as an early Christmas gift. At first I wasn't in love with it. I was disappointed because I wanted a camera that had image stablization. This camera instead boasted about its ISO sensitivity settings and fast shutter speed. (They claimed it was similar to image stablization) When I first tried it out I was in a very low light setting and was experiencing some blur in my images which was exactly what I was trying to avoid in a new camera! I almost traded this one in for something different (A cheaper priced olympus with IS) but thankfully I gave the camera another chance first and decided to play around with all the manual settings. There are a lot of them in the menus so you can fine tune it like you wouldn't believe. This ability to change its setup is what made me stick with the Sony. However, I wouldn't say this camera is ideal for very low light situations. The two preset choices of shooting a low-light scene without flash won't give you crystal clear pictures especially if you experience a tiny bit of camera shake. But again, it goes back to the adjustments in the menus, you can make manual adjustments and get pretty decent pictures with minumal (or no) blur. But you have to take the time to find and set the right ISO and light settings. I highly suggest using the histogram that you can pop-up onto the screen for help. Unless you are willing to spend about $200 more on a camera, you won't find one that will perform great in very low light anyway. And like my husband said... "really... how often are you taking shots in the dark honey?" Hey, there's Halloween trick-or-treating and fouth of July fireworks and other night time events I retorted, but he's right. There really isn't a lot of real low-light pictures you take where you aren't using a flash. I know lots of people (me included) like to try and figure out all the menu options and settings on their own before reading a manual... but this one, if you really want super amazing shots, reading the manual will give you A LOT of insight on how powerful a camera it really is. For people that always read the manual this is probably a big "DUUUH"! But if you are like me and like to try and rush through and figure it out, you are missing out on a ton of nice options. Some great features: The camera doubles as a video camera and it is only limited to recording up to the amt of space available in your memory stick. Other cameras will only let you record a pre-set maximum number of minutes. I also like the Burst modes which allow you to take shots in fast succession. Great for action shots. But take note, when using a burst mode you cannot use the flash. (Again, watch out for low light!) I have a 3 year old daughter and the fast shutter speed (and burst) works great in a well lit situation. Just the other day I caught shots of her running around and jumping up and down that came out crystal clear. No blur at all. Every flying and bouncing hair on her head came out perfectly frozen in time. Quite neat! I gave this camera 4 stars because the camera performs wonderfully in every situation except very low light. But for the price, you can't do much better anyway. Its a great buy and I think just about anyone would be pleased to receive it as a gift. 
Just be sure to get a case along with it, because the large screen could get scratched 
I had previously owned a Kodak Easy share that died while I was on vacation. I loved the easy to learn and use features on that camera so I wanted another camera that was easy for a non-professional to use. This little camera has been great! I've had it for a few months now and LOVE THE PICTURES! It is very easy to use and is super small which makes it easy to throw in my purse to take anywhere. The pictures are crisp and clear and the battery lasts forever. My old Kodak used to take real AA batteries and I thought a camera with its own little rechargeable battery might be strange but it's actually MUCH easier and lasts way longer than the AA's did in my old Kodak. The LCD screen is huge and makes it very easy to review photos. Just one little click to go to review and back to taking photos. Only two downfalls I've found so far are that the little setting dial moves easily on its own so you have to always check it before taking a picture or it might be on some strange setting or video. The other thing is that I haven't been able to figure out if there is a way to delete all of the photos on the camera after you upload them - I've had to delete them one by one which is a slow process. Other than those two little things this camera is WONDERFUL! Highly recommended 
I am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera. Occaisionally when I turn it on the lense doiesn't slide out, which is a little disconcerting. However, if I tap it, or turn it off and turn it o n again, it comes out to the operational position. I enjoy using it, amd wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one 
I am very pleased with this item. The size is right, the resolution of the photos perfect. I am enjoying using the camera 
Excellent choice to make a great job. 
OK -- allow me to mention that the ONLY thing I dislike is that to charge this camera's battery, you have to remove the battery and put it in a small wall charger. The battery charge seems weak and I have to charge it a lot more than the old one. My last Sony digital camera (a recent one, too) has a plug that fit into the camera and you'd charge it while it sat downloading or just "parked"... I get a bit nervous about opening and closing a battery door constantly. That's what did in a Nikon CoolPix I had. :/ Now that said, I gotta shout - I LOVE this camera. Slim to fit into my pocket or small purse, lens covers when it's off, screen I already have a plastic guard on, and the photos are quality. Hard to take a bad pic with this! I'd say "I'd buy it again!" but I already did -- a gift for my son! Two thumbs up for ease of use, quality pics, and, GREAT price 
I bought this camera two weeks ago, have taken about 100 pics, and my battery is still nearly fully charged. I thought I'd have to buy another battery when I decided to buy this camera, but I'm glad I held off, because it's not necessary (unless you're going on a two-week excursion in the bush with no access to electricity...) No problems with red-eye, no blurry pictures when taken inside with low light, and outstanding battery life. I am getting more than I expected when I purchased this camera. I would recommend it (and show it off!) to anyone 
This is a outstanding camera for it's size. Easy to use, easy to carry and produces great pictures. Would recommend to anyone who is ready to give up film and go digital 
I am new to SLRs and I cant belive how good this camera is. This camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces. I always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent, but looking back, they look terrible compared to this. 
I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin. I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working. The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory. The photos, however, are wonderful. Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable. (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos. 
When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery. They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes. Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice. So I said no. So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots. Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase. Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button. So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine. as for the quality of photos.....i love them 
I had 2 Rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses. While I had owned other digitals I keep going back to my old Rebel, until now. We got the back up battery pack. My husband and I love it 
I already had a digital rebel and was able to sell it to a co-worker and use the proceeds for my new rebel xt. Faster, lighter, better. Simple review. It took everything that was great about my digital rebel and made it better. Some complain that it feels "too light"...OK...it that's your thing. To me, it's still solid and the pictures speak for themselves. Now, with the addition of the 10 MP rebel xt, I'll bet the original xt can be purchased for an even better price. No downsides that I can think of.. 
I have had digital cameras for about 5 years and still own an Olympus 5 megapixel, and a Casio 7 megapixel. Seems like Megamixels alone just don't cut it for me. I read about the rebel XT in a magazine and looked up the user reviews here on Amazon. I decided to go and buy one and though I am really a novice, I am extremely impressed. I have never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors from a Point Shoot. I started with the basic settings and love the results.I am slowly progressing to more advanced settings and am getting better everyday. Even a novice who just wants stunning photography will be amazed with this camera. I also bought a Tamron 75-300 Autofocus zoom lens (look for it here on Amazon.com) and after lots of practice, have been able to take some great pictures. I have a brother in the UK who is also into digital photography, and after seeing some (full reso) photos I sent him, he rushed out and bought the XTi (called the EOS 400D across the pond)and is amazed with it. I still have a lot to learn but really cannot fault this camera. The included software is also excellent. For the record, some reviews seem to think it is too small to hold, I have big hands and don't have any problems at all. I admit though this is the first SLR I have ever owned. I will still keep a point and shoot to keep in my travel bag for spontaneous photography but I am in love with my Rebel XT!! This camera costs quite chunk of change but I think it is well worth it and I do recommend it to everyone 
I'm not sure why "rkm001" had so many issues with this product. I have owned one for about two months now and use it very heavily. It cuts a straight line for me everytime and I have never had something "stick" to the cutting strip. I actually bought this one to replace a very worn (and more expensive trimmer/cutter) I had for years, and wish I had done it sooner 
It performs as you'd expect. The bar holds the paper in place, and the cutter cuts the paper. I also got the perforating and scoring blades, and those also work very well. Using the cutter and perforator, I've made several custom-size notebooks with tear-out pages 
Clearly "rkm001" has had some difficulty in using this equipment. I have one that I used as part of my job. I have probably cut over 1000 photos/labels/etc. Other people in the office have cut more than 2000 photos. It does exactly what it is supposed to do - it cuts a straight line along the edge of the guide. Where this problem arises is when the cutting surface, underneath the cutting wheel, becomes worn from use. I grove will slowly develop and since the cutting surface is not fixed in position and can slide from side to side, the grove will not be straight nor will it be parallel to the cutting guide. To solve this problem, you should not use extreme force when cutting. Gentle pressure is adequate for cutting a photo. You can also remove the cutting surface and rotate it 90 or even flip it over. This gives you four cutting surfaces to work with. Ultimately you will need to replace it. Carl makes those too. For $20, it works well and unless you plan to cut thousands of times a month, it is fine for home or light office use 
I've had my D70s for about a year now, haven't regretted it for a second. The controls are laid out logically, with everything to hand. The dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate. I personally love the optional grid overlay, I have no excuses for horizons that aren't horizontal. The wireless flash system is great, though you have to buy an SB-600 or SB-800 to get the full benefit. This camera is bigger and heavier than the D50 and D80, which in my opinion is a positive thing. 
I am a professional photographer, and I have owned this camera for nearly two years. I also have a D70 for backup. The batteries go forever, it is very quick to respond, the images are beautiful, and it has the typical Nikon durability and reliability. If you are already a Nikon user, the controls will fall easily to hand. That having been said, the computer software with this camera is a joke. For the best image quality shoot RAW files, color balance with a grey card, and render the images with software like Capture One LE. The uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars. Come on, Nikon, be real!!! Shortly after I got my first D70, I shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog. I got an ugly feeling in my gut when I was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure, cropped to the head and shoulders, and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog. By the time I found out, it was already at the printer. As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great. After that incident, I have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results. This camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button. In resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera. It is imperative to shoot RAW and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera. I can't wait to try the D80 
I do weddings, portrait, and outdoor photography and I don't see any reason why I'd ever switch from the D70 (other than the D80 :). This camera is professional grade at the consumer price point. Don't be scared by the 6.1 MP. I print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems. I'd recommend reading Thom Hogans manual 
The D70s is a minor update of the original D70 introduced in 2004, with a few new features and a slightly larger LCD. It's still a great camera, but expect it to be replaced by the new D80, which has 40 percent more pixels, a 2.5-inch LCD, and additional useful features at the old price of the D70s. So, you can probably save a little money and still purchase a sophisticated digital SLR if you wait until prices of the D70s stabilize at a new, lower level. At, say, $600, this camera would be an incredible bargain. The D70s has shined as one of the best cameras in its class since its introduction. For example, it has a 1/500th second flash synch speed (found in no other camera but the D50) so you can keep ambient light under control and avoid ghost images. Its autofocus is fast and accurate, and features both single-autofocus, continuous-autofocus (for tracking action), and a novel "automatic" autofocus mode that switches between AF-S and AF-C as required. If you have no Nikon lenses, get this camera with the 18-70mm kit lens, which is very sharp and versatile, rather than the more limited 18-55 lens. You won't regret it 
Excellent camera kit. Versatile. I have a lot to learn about the camera, though, as it is no simple point-and-shoot. However, in Auto mode, it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. I look forward to learning how to use it fully. Lenses came with warranty cards, but the camera itself did not. I bought the SB-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 GB compact flash cards to round out the kit. Camera with lens attached is large, which I underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. Great camera, though. Price was the best I could find anywhere 
It has a learning curve, that's for sure, but WOW! This camera is worht every penny, far more stable then the comparable Canon Rebel, and the product comes with better lenses. The quality of glass DOES matter 
I have to say that is an excellent purchase. I'm a fan of my P880 camera. Wide Angle Len, a feature included, allows to take great panoramic views, with no efforts. The manual optical zoom is great, gives you a control of the picture that i never had with a comercial digital camera. One of my favorites features is the zoom for reviewing the picture, is a 10X zoom and you can check detailed the picture in the LCD screen as in your PC. The 8 Megapixels, allows you to see with great precision minimal details that usually you don't see. Is a great experience, when you take a picture,return home, and the picture is better than your memory. I'm still learning about the other features, but rigth now i think that has a great performance-value relation, and most important, allow my to have photos with a professional touch,. From the South Of the World Carolina 
Great affordable camera, that takes very nice pictures. 
The Kodak P880 is a remarkable bargain that produces astonishing photos. With its 8 megapixels and zoom lens it operates like more expensive SLR's. The quality of the photos, even at the highest zoom, is astounding. For anyone interested in an easy to operate, high quality camera, this is the one 
I bought my camera a few months ago, so I have had a chance to figure out most of its features, not all lol, but I consider that a good thing (extra features means more messing around with it ^-^. Well anyways it is an excellent camera, it does all of the things I want it too, and its half the price of a Rebel. The video it takes is amazing and can record till there is no space on the SD card. For me I have a SanDisk 1g SecureMemory SD Card and I can take about 27 minutes on it which is plenty. And about 38 secounds on the 38mb internal drive. I can take about 329 pictures on the 1g SD and about 10 on the internal. The battery is great on it, I have used it countless hours and havent gotten one bar to go down, so about 2-3 days of use will run it down. So I asume about 8-10 hours. I have never had it die on me, with out me intentually letting it (I guess its better to let the battery run out and then charge it) The focus and zoom feature is fun to play with on the camera and comes in really handy (for the extra zoom there is the zoom button on the top left of the camera, so you really dont need to buy one of those cameras with the 10x) What else? Well the manual features (the biggest reason I got the camera)so play with the ap., iso, and shutter speed they are so fun to mess with, even the hue of the photo which I didnt expect to like, I actually got off really good shots with. The auto features come in handy too, just click and shoot! Macro is a neat feature, get in close its amazing and your shots will be beautiful! Screen is good to, with a crowd around me most can still see the image on the screen (I take video's of my boyfriend and friends sparing)The Mic is on top, it does its job (when its windy you can actually block the wind without even knowing because your hand while on the "on,off-shoot" button covers it (good design)Uploads pic quickly on computer and deleting picutres is extremely quick and easy. The af (auto-focus), focus, and ae are easy to get to for quick fixs other then the focus on the front of the camera. And flash does good. Well I hope my long drawn out review was helpful. I hope you enjoy your camera. I will shortly be purchasing a smaller camera for v-logs possible a canon sd630. But YES DO BUY THE KODAK P880 the mega-pix are simply amazing 
I have taught photography at the college level, shoot 4x5 view camera work on occasion, and am very demanding about image quality. I am quite satisfied with the image quality from my Kodak P880, particularly after I installed the newest firmware upgrade available from Kodak. I went through several 7MP to 8 MP cameras before finally getting the Kodak P880. The P880 has better image quality than some high end Sonys and Olympus 7-8 MP cameras like the DSC-V3 or the SP350. I tested the P880 against the even higher end 10.3 MP large sensor Sony R1 and the difference in image quality in a 13x19 print between the P880 and the R1 was barely perceptible after minor sharpening and noise reduction, which the P880 images accept particularly well. The zoom lens has a very useful range and is generally pretty sharp throughout its range. Balance, manual controls and features feel high end and adequate for most semi-professional needs. The camera is a little slow processing and storing pictures in RAW format and exposure bracketing modes but that really doesn't bother me because I do mostly landscape and fine art photos. RAW file format is directly supported by most versions of Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements as well as most other RAW processing programs like Bibble Pro. Unlike most sub-$500 cameras, the P880 uses regular screw in haze and polarizing filters, a real plus and it has a highly controllable hot shoe. Manual focus is usable and manual exposure control works well. The direct mechanical zoom is also nice. Overall, the P880 is a digital camera that can either be a high end point and shoot SLR-styled camera or one that can be used as fully manually as the most classic 35 mm film SLR. Although not small enough to slip in a pocket, the size is still reasonable and light 
Bought by P880 about a month ago. I am a sem-pro outdoor adventure photographer and I use Nikon 35mm film equipment for the most part. I shoot slide film on my F90s Nikon. I had a 5mp Kodak digital camera but wanted to upgrade to a better digital camera but I could not justify buying a Nikon D50 or D70s as they are only 6mp. And I didn't want to drop 2 grand on a D200. So I looked in the mid-range camera lines. After doing MUCH research, I decided to buy this camera. So far I am happy I did. I have taken it hiking several times, enough that I know its a good camera but of course its a toy compared to pro Nikon film cameras. But I knew that when I bought it. I wanted to have a good camera to take lots of "documentary", "fun" and "travel" shots. For the really powerful stuff I will still shoot slide film. But its too expensive to shoot with extensively! Here's my initial impressions based on the perspective of an outdoor photosgrapher: The Good: 1) Fairly easy to hold as its tall and has an actual grip. 2) Lightweight (but of course at the expense of impact resistance I'm sure...) 3) Great set of manual controls! This is the best part. Autobracket is good as is the interval timer which is great for self-potraits. You can walk far away from the camera and get yourself in the shot (great for solo hikers). 4) Large 2.5" LCD makes it easy to check out your photos 5) Image quality seems pretty good (although not comparable to a high-res. scan of a slide). 6) The manual zoom is great! Much better than power zooms in almost all other cameras. 7) The 24mm focal length is simply amazing! Great for landscapes and outdoor adventure shots. 8) The battery life is great. Shot 250 or so pics on a full charge and that included a lot of playing around with the menus, reviewing photos, etc. I just boughta second Kodak battery on Amazon for $16! 9) Built in flash is pretty powerful and you can add a shoe mount unit as well. 10) 8mp of resolution for the price of a 6mp camera. The not so good: 1) Seems to write to the card pretty slowly. Definately not for action shots! Maybe this would improve if I bought a faster SD card. 2) The "toggle" button on the back for navigating through the menues worries me. Seems like it could break someday. I am gentle with it. Wish they would create a more durable feeling toggle. 3) The LCD viewfinder is hard to see on a bright sunny day. This is where a film camera is WAY better. Optical viewfinders cannot be beat. 4) The in screen manual focus is no good at all. Better just focus with your eyes. 5) Wish they would have made the handgrip a little grippier by adding a rubber stip or the like. Is a little slippery in the hands (always use a neck strap!) In all I highly recommend this camera. If they were to improve upon some of the items for which I have some critisism, I would easily give this camera a perfect review!! Good luck with your purchas 
This was the third 8 meg SD camera I tried - it was the only one that without using a tripod indoors gave me sharp, crisp pictures most of the time. The zoom was smaller that the Fuji or the Panasonic, but the color saturation and sharpness were heads and shoulders above the others. Excellent camera that shoots jpg, tiff and raw 
I bought this camera for my work. I'm an architect and I was looking for a camera with a wide angle lens for interior photography with a budget that wasn't going to break the bank. I had looked at the Kodak V570, which had a 23mm fixed lens and I was seriously considering it but was concerned about the durability and reliablilty (it seemed fragile). Then I stumbled across the Kodak P880 (Kodak should really do a better job of advertising their cameras), which is comparably priced to the V570. This camera is the next best thing to a digital SLR, and has many of the same features. My wife has a Canon Rebel XT, which is a really great camera, and the P880 gives it a really good run for the money with regards to features and picture quality at about half the price. I've had this camera about a week and have been putting it through its paces and so far I have been very happy with the results. I would recommend this camera to anyone thinking of getting an digital SLR but is hesitant about the SLR price 
This filter works great. I have used this filter on a Nikon 18-70mm lens and have produced excellent pictures. I have yet to experience any flare with this polarizer. Great polarizer for a great price 
The new Nikon EN-EL3e battery is a slight update for the Nikon EN-EL3 provided with earlier dSLR models such as the D70. It adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery. The battery is grey to distinguish it from the black EN-EL3. The EN-EL3e is backwards compatible with the EN-EL3: you can put it in your D70 or D50. The reverse is not true. The number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors, including shooting style, LCD usage, and of course, camera. (The 2.5" LCD on the D200 will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller D70.) It is sufficient for a day of shooting. Unless you are using a D200 in some professional capacity, in which case, you'll probably be investing in at least one backup battery 
This is the real thing. It seems to be impossible to get anywhere and I got it overnight from Amazon. Wow 
This review is from personal experience. I recently picked up a D200 to replace my D70. This past weekend I took the photos for my sister's wedding. I shot with full functionality using LCD review for every shot and was using the Nikon 18-200 VR lens. Over the course of the wedding and reception I took 295 photos in Fine JPEG mode and reviewed them while shooting. At the end of the afternoon, I still had battery life left and very likely could have taken 100 more photos. Given the features and capability of the D200, I have absolutely no issue with that many photos. I will pick up a second battery for a back up as soon as someone has some in stock. And I could not agree more with the previous reviewer. If you do not have personal experience with this product, there is no need to attempt to review it based on hearsay or something you might have read elsewhere 
I used my new Nikon D200 this past weekend at a Renaissance Faire in high heat, and the EL3e performed like a champ (as did the camera itself). I couldn't believe that I got through three full days of picture-taking (using fill flash after five pm or so) on one battery charge. I finally ran out of juice late on the third day, after approximately 500 exposures. (One caveat: I don't use auto-focus. At all. Ever. So, you know, YMMV. 
This is my first and very expensive entry into digit SLR photography. I have used canon point and shoot digital camera previously. I was avoiding DSLR's because I used to rarely use my EOS film SLR. The convienience of a point and shoot from that experience was overwhelming. Unfortunately so are it's limitations. So back I came, and the only choice though expensive was the EOS 5d for it's full frame sensor! The pain was reduced by the double rebates. Wow! This is a revelation! Beautifull images, lot of control. I did notice that the AF was not as fast as my old Elan IIE. I was also disappointed that for the price there was a lack of weather sealing. I am not happy with canon for this, but I really appreciate them for making a full frame sensor in a difficult marketable slot as far as their line up was concerned. This camera also needs prime or L lenses, because the sensor will reveal the inadequacies of inferior lenses. This add's to the cost. This is an exceptional photographic tool that I hope to use to improve my skill as I explore all it's capabilities 
This camera is amazing. I have been a canon user for many years, upgrading as I go. I can not think right now of a camera they could come out with to make me want to upgrade from the 5D. This will certainly be my camera for some time to come 
This is an excellent camera. I upgraded from the EOS 20D which was also a great camera. I upgraded for a couple of reasons. The first was the Full Frame sensor. The EOS 20D has a 1.6X crop factor which effects your lenses overall focal length. On the EOS 5D you get the true focal length of your attached lens. Just like film SLR cameras. Awesome! The one problem I've noticed with the Full Frame sensor on the EOS 5D is it is huge. When you are changing lenses this sensor picks up every little piece of dust, dirt and fibers like a vacuum. I'm constantly cleaning the sensor with a blower. I also had to bring it to a Canon service center. Just to remove some of the dust off the sensor that my blower could not remove. The Canon service center was very far from my home. (Very annoying). I never experienced this problem with the EOS 20D. But, the images you get from the full frame sensor are far superior to the smaller sensor on the EOS 20D. The other reason I upgraded was the larger LCD. The 2.5' LCD screen is a nice plus. The images look bright and sharp. Overall I love this camera. Build, features and image quality are excellent!!!  
After 3 decades as a Nikon 35mm film 'loyalist', a co-worker let me test drive his Canon 5D, Canon EF 16-35mm f2.8L USM and SanDisk Extreme III 2 GB card. Viewing the images on his LCD computer screen helped me decide to sell almost everything Nikon (I kept their SB-800 flash for wireless slave setups) and switch to the established DSLR leader, Canon. Finally, no more heavy and bulky Nikon F5 and having to pay and wait for film processing! No more scanning negatives for hours each night! I've owned the 5D, Canon EF 17-40mm f4L USM, Canon EF 70-200mm f4L USM with tripod collar and Canon Speedlite 580EX for about 3 months and have taken over a thousand RAW and large JPEG images in ISO's ranging from 50 to 3200. (Note: 4 weeks ago, a backup Canon Digital Rebel XT black body was added for the 70-200.) The 5D's image quality stunned every person I have given 4" x 6" and 8.5" x11" colour and monochrome images to. Credit must be given to Canon's Digital Photo Professional (DPP) RAW processing software, Canon's i9900 bubblejet printer, Canon paper and Canon ink. I rarely have to use Adobe Photoshop CS2 anymore because of DPP's quick-to-use tools. The above 5D and any one of the lenses with flash fits nicely into a Tamrac Velocity 7 bag. The larger Velocity 9 bag will fit the entire 2 body with lenses and flash kit. The only negative about the camera is the closed compact flash card gate moves slightly along it's hinge giving the body a less than solid feel. The Digital Rebel XT does not have this issue and therefore feels more solid. A built-in flash would have been nice but not absolutely necessary. Unlike the superb Nikon SB-800, Canon's 580EX is a bit chunky but does it's job wonderfully. The low noise images at ISO's above 800 can easily be removed with DPP or Photoshop. Photoshop goes a step further by removing colour artefacts which lowers the saturation of the image. Meaning saturation would have to be increased after noise removal. Bottom line: If you believe that it costs Canon more to manufacturer a full-frame CMOS image sensor and don't mind spending several months salary on the 5D, go for it! Also, choose your lenses carefully. Canon L lenses go well with the 5D. 
If you've been considering a digital full frame camera (and who hasn't?) this is the one that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Now that Kodak is out of the picture, your choices are the EOS 5D or the 1DS Mark II, which costs more than twice as much. You do have to give up a few things, such as a super-fast frame rate for continuous shooting, but the 5D has the resolution you need for top-quality images, and the ability to get true wide angle perspectives from your EF lenses. I happened to shoot this camera at a concert side-by-side with a vendor "N" camera, both under available light with 85mm f/1.8 lenses at a range of ISOs. I found some shots I liked from the other camera, shot at ISO 400, and comparable shots from the 5D which, to my surprise, turned out to be exposed at ISO 3200. The 5D absolutely lives up to its low noise reputation. But don't take my word for it, try one out for yourself 
THE CON: I've own this now for 6 months, i shoot weddings portraits. I did alot of tests, especially the picture modes. Well don't waste your time with these, their all bad, with the exception of the landscape. You'll just end up using the Standard mode for best all arround shooting. The venetting does accure arround the edges, mostly in low light. Worst of all is the color ballance or White ballance in Auto mode. For what ever reason it has a hard time. My D60 out performs it here big time, not sure why. So you may have to shoot a grey card to get your White ballance more accurate. THE PROS: Quality of the pic is excellent, color saturation is awsome. Blow up of 2'x3' was excellent detail, no noise. I've found the focus of mine to be real good, no problems here. Ease of use after learning curve becomes easy, just read the manuel. CONCLUSION: I would buy again except for that AWB problem. Now i have owned both the D60 and the 10D and neither seemed to have this problem as bad. I use this mode when doing weddings because I'm always on the move and go from one differn't light sorce to another inbetween shots (Tungsten to Daylight). I still think Canon is the best and will alway buy their products 
While the 5D may be less expensive than the so-called professional grade, the camera is more oriented toward the Pro end than the 20D (or 30D) with fewer of dial settings but more capability. Others have covered some other areas, so I'll try to avoid repetition. The full frame makes a great deal of difference to me. I like to print large images and I like to use L or other higher end Canon lenses (with a couple of knockoffs). There's no tradeoff in weight of consequence or compactness. The truth is that I prefer the recent glass that isn't computed for the smaller sensor. I liked the 20D, a lot, and most of my gear carries over to the 5D. I now have three cameras that take the same card and battery. The 5D if anything feels and looks more rugged that the 20D while being very compact. But the pictures? Great. The 20D was and is a first rate camera at 8.2 and its ability to use all Canon lenses, plus the EF-S for the smaller digital image. One person cited slowness over the 20D. I won't disagree with that, but it isn't a big deal to me. I typically use the drive for bracketing on the fly, but almost never for anything just to do a fast sequence, e.g. sports. I've owned motorr drives going back to my days as a pro in the 60s and 70s and they have their uses. Esssential sometimes.But they are like autofocus. On occasion, you need to be manual. Whenever possible, I prefer to single shot or on occasion, a three shot burst. I find there's less chance of missing what I'm shooting. The "Decisive Moment" too often falls between the frames on motor driving. But that's to everyone's taste. I really am impressed with the camera and having tried it, look forward to a trip with it, with the trusty 20D as the second. 
Just got the 5D..traded in my 20D...the 5D is a more solid camera with a full frame sensor...pictures are great and it is easy to use if you are familiar with the Canon system...a little pricey, but worth it!! You'll use it for years 
I will use this lens as a standard on my Rebel XT rather than the the 18-55mm lens that came with the camera. It gives much greater flexibility in outdoor shoots when I'm capturing my grandsons in action on the soccer field. 
For the price, this is an excellent lens. On an APS sized sensor it is equivalent to 480mm at the long end. Some complain about it being a slow lense since the max aperture at full zoom is 5.6 That just means you can't use it in low light and expect great results. If you want a fast lense at that length, however, be prepared to pay a lot of money. With the USM it focuses very fast. Works well for outdoor sports. My rating is based on what you get for the money. Of course it's not as good as L glass but it's way less money 
I bought a Canon EOS 20D digital SLR and the Canon EF 75-300mm zoom lens to take photographs of my children's various sporting events. The magnification factor of this lens is perfect for a variety of sporting events including lacrosse, basketball, swimming and gymnastics. The focusing speed is very good for capturing action shots. I highly recommend this lens as an affordable general purpose zoom lens 
This lens was all I anticipated and more. The auto focus fast and accurate. I gat stunning action shots 
I have just begun my interest in photography and this was the first zoom lense I have ever bought. The lense provided all that I could ever ask for. I just got back from the zoo with the kids and the photographes are excellent 
We are by far professional photographers, but for the most part I liked the lens. We wanted something we could zoom a bit more than with what the Digital Rebel came with and it does great! My only problem is that if I want to take a close up pic I have to switch back to the original lens. There is probably a reason for this that I am unaware of. Minor inconvienience for great zoom capability. 
the monopod functions as i hoped and for the price was an excellent dea 
The Sima monopod is perfect if you're looking for something easy to carry and set up. It exends quickly and has a quick release mount that can stay attached to the camera base. Stability is good, but it does not have a sturdy feel. If you want something with a solid feel, you will have to move up the food chain, but will sacrifice compactness and light weight of this product. 
There's no question that paying $100 or more will get you a better monopod. But for $16 the Sima SMP-1 is a tremendous value. I have a Sony DSC-W5 digital camera and have done everything I can think of to reduce camera-shake in low-light photos. This monopod has been great for adding stability and making my photos less blurry. The key is that it is small enough and light enough that I can take it almost wherever I go. And because it's so small, I can bring it in to places that would frown upon a tripod. A monopod is not a total replacement for a tripod. But this monopod is now the only addition to my camera that I take on trips 
I bought this monopod after reading reviews here. It's really light-weighted. I used it to take pictures for a dance performace where tripod was not possible. I was able to use slow shutter and got great images. Cons: I saw a pro ( I knew he runs a studio) using a similar monopod which was black. So my only complain is its non-black color. Well I am not a pro anyway. 
Great product for the price. However, Amazon did not specify how much it can handle. My experience is about 5 lb. Tried 8 lb on it, start to feel shaky. Still usable if you handle it carefully, but not solid for 8 lb of load 
I am very happy with the item I ordered. Shipment was fast and the price was cheaper than retai 
This product served its purpose; it is the same cord for hooking up the camera to a PC as the one that came with my camera 
my mom lost her USB cable for her digital camera and Amazon always has everything I need so I order it for her 
this cable was a very essential need for me to upload my photos to the computer. i was very fortunate to find it on amazon.co 
it works just like the one that comes with the camera. Comes in a little plastic bag 
Item was just what I needed to hook my camera to my computer and start downloading photos. Had it unpacked, plugged in and working in less then a minute 
This cable is a four-point USB connector that works with some Kodak digital cameras. Be sure that your camera uses a four point connector before buying this one. Many cameras use a five point connector. These Kodak branded cables are high quality at a fair price 
This is an essential part of the digital picture taking. Can't download the pictures from your Kodak camera onto the computer without it. It should come standard with your camera purchase, but if you misplaced yours, this is the one to get. Arrived promptly as ordered and the value is great 
We received our USB cable promptly. As you know the Kodak USB cables are special in that they do not fit any other regular devices that uses a USB cable. These USB cables are for Kodak's only. The product itself turned out to be everything that it was represented as 
I got this stuff as a gift for a friend of mine. He seems to be happy using it. So I am giving this a 5 star 
The case is made of high quality material and fits my Canon powershot A700 perfectly. I would have given it 5 stars if the case had a seperate compartment for carrying an extra set of batteries. There is just enough room to carry the camera and an extra memory chip. No extra batteries. 
Why use another case when this one is built specifically for this camera? I like it, it's sleek and belt-mountable. Also has enough padding so you can throw it in a backpack, suitcase, etc 
The case is great! It fits the camera perfectly and is exactly what I expected to receive when ordering. The price was right but the shipping was a little higher than I expected 
I purchased this case for my Canon A530 camera. I find that it does a great job of being light,durable,and compact. It keeps the camera clean and scratch free. However I wish the case had a better carrying capacity. I would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips. I use different ones for different pictures or video. Batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy. The case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn. That can be a bit akward. Otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well. 
After reviewing my options to purchase for my new Canon A540 we chose this case and I'm glad I did! Nice snug fit for the camera, extra compartments for a memory card batteries, no need for a strap, you are already provided one with the camera. 
IT GIVES THE PROTECCION AND THE HANDLING YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. BUY IT ALONG WITH THE CAMERA NO REGRETS 
Great case. Small, soft, and compact, with extra space for batteries. HOWEVER, the hole for the camera strap is in the center, which means that if your camera strap attaches anywhere OTHER than the middle of the camera, it doesn't line up with this case. Minor detail. For example, the strap of the A530 is near the top of the camera, so the strap goes out the side of the case, unless you pull it sideways to go through the case hole. 
I bought this camera when i was a sophmore in college. And now, 2 years out of college, a handfull of beautiful days, a half-dozen life changing moments, and umpteen vacations later it's still goes with me everywhere and snaps photographs. all the sticker labels on it have since been knocked off but it doesn't matter because i know what they all do. This puppy is built to last. When I eventually pass this one down in the family and buy a new one, I'll be getting another canon for sure. If you're looking for a high-value digital camera that thinks it's a tank, get the Canon s100. 
I've had this camera for three years. I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive. I put a 128MB CF card in it. First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software. I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country. The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it. The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder. If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate. All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera. They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great. When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin. Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific. It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws. Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better. I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted. I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera 
I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem. The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software. The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application. But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera 
Works as designed, performs well with intended lens, construction is plastic though 
This is also the correct lens hood for the new EF 70-300mm F4-5.6 IS USM lens. 4 stars because it's $40 for a piece of plastic that should have been included with both of its intended lenses. Shame on your cheap ways, Canon 
I got these gloves to use when taking outdoor photos in the winter. They work very well, the little rubber grips help you better control the camera without having to expose your hands to the elements. They are not really warm enough for really cold weather (below 20), but work well for 20-50 degrees 
If you're a professional photographer, you can probably ignore this review. But then you probably won't be thinking about buying this lens anyway, as you'll be off to purchase a nice L series. However, if - like me - you just happen to have a nice Canon Digital Rebel camera (or equivalent) and enjoy taking decent pictures, this lens will probably work out very well for you. I've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks, and it has performed very much as expected. For the price, it's perfect for a go-everywhere lens. A few main points. Okay, it's not the best image quality. Even on low/medium ISO it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive Canon lenses. It struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit, but for well-lit outdoor shoots it's works very well. Of course, it would be nice to have a nice L series with IS, but if you can't afford that then this is a very good value lens. Not for the real professionals, but great if you don't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and, let's face it, who doesn't want a but more zoom 
What a wonderful lens!! I'm purely a hobby shooter, but I do like to take nice shots. I took this to the zoo the other day and was able to take fantastic closeups of the polar bears, even through glass, and pick out the details on the butterfly wings. The lens is not as heavy as I had feared, and unlike some zooms it does not telescope out under its own weight, so it was comfortable enough to keep carrying all day. I'm using it on a Canon D60 and am nothing but pleased with the performance so far 
I purchased this lens for my Canon EOS 20D digital camera and so far I really like it. It focuses fast and produces very sharp, clear images. As with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake; I've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots. I really like the 28-200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots. The lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed, which is typical for Canon products. For the price range, this is an excellent lens. You can only do better by spending considerable more money on an IS lens 
I am a railfan, and having a very large range of zoom is important. Shooting on the fly from a distant bridge shot to a closeup coming around the bend. Focuses quickly too. I have a Canon 10D and I HATE changing lenses because it gets dust inside the camera. This 28-200mm is very practical for my hobby, and gets used on Waterfall and other outdoor scenery too. One note of interest, it is hard to get super-sharp background details with this lens, compared to any of the IS lenses or the L Series lenses, (a buddy and I shot the same closeup shot with an ore dock way in the background and the dock details looked a LOT sharper on his 28-135 IS lens). Same Camera, same settings. Closeup Focused object looked great on both, just when looking at the out-of-focus objects, the IS lenses seemed to do better. This lens is worth the price in my opinion, and superb for amateurs and hobby-photographers like myself. But those looking for a touch more in distant details out of the focused field, the 28-135 IS USM lens by Canon seems to be a little step ahead of this. The L series lenses, of course, are in a league of their own 
I am generally pleased with this lense, and if I could only carry one lense with my digital rebel, this is the one I would take 
We use it with a Canon 300D. It gives good picture quality and are quick to focus. Become a 44-320 on the 300D. A good buy 
From portraits to sporting events, this is wonderful multi-purpose lens. Prior to purchasing the lens, I asked a buddy of mine (photographer for the Philadelphia Flyers, NHL Hockey Team and long time Canon user) if this was a quality lens. He told me to go for it as it is the best buy for the money and that distortion and spherical abberation are extremely minimal with this lens. Truth be told, I've never seen an EF lens I didn't like 
I found this lens resonable as an all around lens, although when it comes to portaits or close-ups I would recomend the Canon 100mm f/2.8 macro. If your looking for a camera to use it on I would highly recomend the Canon 10D WOW 
I needed more reach than 400mm gave on my EOS 1D, so I purchased Canon's 500mm f/4L IS three years ago. It's incredibly sharp out to the corners at f/4. With bird and mammal portraits, you see every feather, every hair. The lens is light enough to use on a Wimberley Sidekick. Some claim to be able to handhold it, but I think its eight-plus pound weight is a bit much for that. I carry mine in a long lens case with backpack harness from Kinesis Gear. This lens' image stabilization works very well. I've used it on a tripod with one-second shutter speeds and good telephoto technique, and gotten sharp, publishable images. With an EOS 1D or 1Ds, lens and camera are rain-proof in mild storms. I also got mine through Adorama, and had no problem with delivery or post-sale advertising. If you buy one expensive long lens for wildlife, choose this one. 
Let's face it. This is a great lens. But, I want to warn you about Adorama. I highly recommend that you choose a better vendor. Adorama is SLOW. They don't respond to emails. They took a week to ship my lens when they said it was in stock. Their customer service is non-existent. Their prices are no better than anyone else. Almost every time I've ordered from them they have contacted me to try and sell me more stuff. (Which further delays shipping) A totally unprofessional organization. I for one will never order from them again. Good luck if you do 
After noting the captions of exceptional photographs that appeared in nature and photography magazines were often shot with this lens, I began to read the reviews. Based on the uniformly excellent reviews, I bought this lens and spent two weeks this January in the Florida Everglades taking pictures of birds. Based upon my experience with the lens, I would rate this as second in sharpness and contrast only to the 300 mm f2.8 Canon L series lens. The lens is handholdable for short periods to shoot birds in flight, but it is best suited for use on a solid tripod with a Wimberley tripod head to allow tracking of birds in flight 
Good advice from the other reviewer about the picture. That having been said I have three of these and really wouldn't want to do without them. These clean my camera's screen and the glass on my lenses without a scratch every time. In my opinion almost a must have in your bag! Good luck 
Amazon states; Product Dimensions: 13.0 x 10.0 x 7.0 inches There was no photo (until I uploaded one) so I thought this was the size stated, but turned out to be one of the little keychain bags with about a 5x5 cloth inside. Works fine, just not what I thought it was, and didn't want someone else to think it was large also. See my photo for actual size next to some keys. Update 4/8/2006 I see they added a photo of what I THOUGHT I was getting when I ordered.. see my uploaded photo in "customer" photos to see what they sent. Not sure WHICH you would get at this point.. Edit 07/29/2006 I see now and then the price I paid jumps from about $5 to $20 for some strange reason.. I have to add that it's a good product @ $5 but not for $20 
I use it for my s70.. It works over 10meters (thats right!) and from the back too, so I am very happy with it.. I bought it today so maybe it is improved now.. 
Great for using with a tripod, now you can be in the pictures too 
I am new to SLRs and I cant belive how good this camera is. This camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces. I always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent, but looking back, they look terrible compared to this. 
I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camea, its beyond description... 
This Camera is excellent one!! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category, I'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles.. Highly recommended 
It is extremely easy to use. Hard to figure out the menu, but once that is done there is no problem. Takes beautiful pictures. Great for action shots as well. Seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in 
I had 2 Rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses. While I had owned other digitals I keep going back to my old Rebel, until now. We got the back up battery pack. My husband and I love it 
I already had a digital rebel and was able to sell it to a co-worker and use the proceeds for my new rebel xt. Faster, lighter, better. Simple review. It took everything that was great about my digital rebel and made it better. Some complain that it feels "too light"...OK...it that's your thing. To me, it's still solid and the pictures speak for themselves. Now, with the addition of the 10 MP rebel xt, I'll bet the original xt can be purchased for an even better price. No downsides that I can think of.. 
I have had digital cameras for about 5 years and still own an Olympus 5 megapixel, and a Casio 7 megapixel. Seems like Megamixels alone just don't cut it for me. I read about the rebel XT in a magazine and looked up the user reviews here on Amazon. I decided to go and buy one and though I am really a novice, I am extremely impressed. I have never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors from a Point Shoot. I started with the basic settings and love the results.I am slowly progressing to more advanced settings and am getting better everyday. Even a novice who just wants stunning photography will be amazed with this camera. I also bought a Tamron 75-300 Autofocus zoom lens (look for it here on Amazon.com) and after lots of practice, have been able to take some great pictures. I have a brother in the UK who is also into digital photography, and after seeing some (full reso) photos I sent him, he rushed out and bought the XTi (called the EOS 400D across the pond)and is amazed with it. I still have a lot to learn but really cannot fault this camera. The included software is also excellent. For the record, some reviews seem to think it is too small to hold, I have big hands and don't have any problems at all. I admit though this is the first SLR I have ever owned. I will still keep a point and shoot to keep in my travel bag for spontaneous photography but I am in love with my Rebel XT!! This camera costs quite chunk of change but I think it is well worth it and I do recommend it to everyone 
I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this camera. If you have teens in the house watchout!, they'll definitely want this camera. It is easy to use and well worth the money. When my camera arrived, I was amazed at how small and compact it was. I let my son check it out first and within no time we were both using it. I really love the movie feature. You can record anywhere and everywhere and the sound is excellent. My last camera only recorded, but didn't have any sound. It was nothing compared to this Sony. The 8.1 mega pixels makes the pictures come out great. My sons and I love it. They record all the time and take numerous pictures. I also like that it has internal memory, so if you don't have a memory stick yet, you can still take pictures. The 2.5 inch screen is perfect. It makes it so easy to get a good shot all the time. I have had no problems with this purchase at all. The only thing I would recommend to Sony is to make something that would protect the 2.5 inch screen from getting scratches, just like they do with the optical lens. It is always closed and covered when its not in use. But besides that small detail there, the Sony is a GREAT investment. I will definitely buy Sony again, especially when I decide to update or if I'm looking for a gift to give. 
Best camera I have ever owned. Easy to use even with all the features. Don't be afraid to buy this one 
The DSCW100 8.1 was a great shirt pocket point and shoot with easy menu directions to the added features built in 
I bought this camera several weeks ago and have test-driven it in the forest preserves of Chicago and in Upper Michigan. It does a terrific job. I am an artist who studied film in school and yet never used a digital camera. I wanted something that was kind of between a point and shoot and an SLR. I wanted some manual functions to fool around with, and yet I also wanted the easy shot for family photos and such. I didn't want to start my digital experience on an expensive SLR, so this proved to be a great buy for me. It's very small and compact and yet very powerful. 
If you are looking for a digital camera with many high level functions and features, the Sony Cybershot 8.1 mp is a great buy. It is highly affordable and takes photos with excellent precision, day or night. The camera is very user friendly and the ease of use is a plus. The memory stick is sold separately and is a must purchase accessory if you plan to take many photos. I am happy with the clarity of the photos and the video functionality that you may want to have handy. The camera is an excellent buy!!! 
I bought this little camera recently from Amazon. Thanks for tremendous service and speedy delivery, Amazon. The Sony DSC-W100 is terrific. It is very simple to operate. The menu system is well-organized and easy to understand. Inserting the battery and memory card is a snap. The Zeiss lens system yields incredibly sharp photos even at the automatic setting. The flash is pretty powerful,too! I took some shots in a rather dark restaurant, and the pictures came out really nice and clear. The macro function is superb with crisp, well-defined details at very close range. The powerup time on this camera is fast as well as time between shots. There is very little shutter lag, and you usually get the picture you intended to get. Autofocus can be a little slower until it "finds" the target perfectly in certain situations. But this is no big deal compared to older digicams. I like being able to switch quickly from viewing the pictures in replay mode back to camera mode by simply tapping the shutter release button lightly. You are quickly ready for another picture. The camera is not miniature and weighs nearly six ounces, which is not extremely light--but is comfortable to carry or place in purse or pocket. I also have a Canon Digital Rebel XT, and this little camera does take sharper pictures. Of course, you do not have the versatility of the SLR, but it is a great everyday camera to take along with you for all the shots you would otherwise miss. I highly recommend this camera and recommend purchase from Amazon. Update: I have now used this camera in the video mode. WOW. It produces incredibly sharp videos with a fast frame rate that looks terrific on our television. A multi-purpose cable is supplied with the camera that allows USB 2.0 and audio/video hookup. You must decide what zoom level before you start shooting your video because once you start, you cannot zoom in and out. If you have a 1 Gb memory stick Pro Duo you can take about 12 minutes of video. I want to get the 2 Gb Pro Duo stick which allows almost 25 minutes of video. This would be ideal to take along when you want to switch between still and video shots and keep your video shots consistent and consecutive in order. You must use the PRO Duo stick for the high quality (fine) video mode 
Photography afficionados have long had two choices when it comes to buying a digital camera: a tiny everything-automatic portable camera that takes decent pictures or a brick-sized everything-manual professional camera that takes fantastic pictures. Almost a decade after the introduction of the consumer digital camera, Sony has finally taken a swing at combining the best qualities of both worlds into one package, and the DSC-W100 is a solid first effort. Sony has had the tiny part down for some time - dimensionally, the W100 is on par with other recent Cybershot models and competitor brands' offerings, and features the now-common 2.5" bright LCD display with a minimum of buttons on the back. Aside from the attractive mini-diamondplate face and chrome trim, visually there's little to set this camera apart among the others at your local electronics counter. Initial toying with the camera doesn't dispel any first impressions. All the prerequisite automatic features are there, the buttons are smartly arranged so all the most common functions are right at hand, it's obviously a point-and-shoot camera. But it's when you begin to delve into the features that you realize that the W100 is something entirely different. The usual mode knob is there on the back with the Auto mode and Scenes modes, but now there's Program and Manual modes - something standard issue on professional cameras but radically new for a point-and-shoot. This means you can use any combination of auto or manual settings on all functions to get a shot. For example, shooting in a dimly lit room, you can use a slow shutter flash to even out lightning, or turn off the flash with a slower shutter for richer colors, or raise the ISO so you can get a steady shot with a higher shutter speed, or just put it in auto and shoot, etc. All the different possibilities previously reserved just for professional cameras are now at your disposal. The camera is as simple or as involved as you want, and it still fits in your pocket. I've owned several other digital cameras, both portable and pro, and they've all had somewhat manual features, but the W100 takes it to a new level. Mounting the W100 on a tripod, I attempted to get a long exposure shot of the night sky, something all the other digital cameras have done adequately. Manually setting the shutter speed, the camera displayed the overall exposure value as I adjusted - the camera was telling me before even touching the shutter button if the resulting picture would be dark, bright, or even. I set the shutter as slow as it could go and using the two-second timer, fired away. The picture was amazing; though only a few stars were visible to the eye, the W100 caught the light of well over a hundred. I noticed a bit of radial blur on the stars around the border of the image, only to realize later that the camera was pointed North - the shutter speed was so slow that I was actually *capturing the rotation of the Earth*. Now THAT'S manual. Also of special note is the W100's digital "Smart Zoom". As a general rule with digital cameras, you should disable the digital zoom feature, as zooming in beyond the optical range produces a cropped and therefore lower-quality image. But here again Sony has a trick up it's sleeve, by cropping from an 8.1 megapixel capture regardless of where you have the image size set. If you shoot a 5 megapixel-size picture that utilizes the digital zoom, the image is actually captured at a full 8.1 Mps and then your 5Mp picture is cropped from that. The result is an optically-zoomed clear picture. This also means that at the lowest image size, you can get a full 15x zoom (the equivalent of a 500+ mm telephoto - in a pocket camera!). It's an absolutely brilliant technique that you'll probably see on all future digital cameras. Sony still has a bit more work to do on the pocket SLR idea. Included with your purchase is an accessories catalog featuring an array of lenses and filters, none of which are compatible with the W100. It's typical of Sony to have a bizarre distribution of features in any given product lineup, but it would seem obvious that the most SLR-like camera should have SLR-like accessories. And W100 owners should disable the Auto Focus Illumination light when shooting people; the blazing red light is great for focusing on inanimate subjects, but could probably be used as a tactical light to blind assailants in a pinch. Overall, the W100 is a remarkable newcomer that truly raises the bar for what you can expect from a point and shoot pocket camera. Novices are accommodated with full automation, and can learn gradually by trying out individual manual functions while other settings remain automatic. And experienced photogs will be right at home with the Manual mode and wide range of settings. Five stars for what is hopefully Sony's work in progress 
Unlike some of the other reviewers, I've had no problems with this battery...and I've had it over a year. I'm a pro photographer, so it has been recharged over and over and over and still holds a charge. Maybe it is better because I tend to totally drain my batteries before recharging? I also use this battery in the Dual Battery Grip alongside the Canon and other off brand batteries 
I bought this battery as a replacement for an old Canon BP511A. It lasted about a couple of months before it started not taking a charge. Complete waste of money 
Ive had it for a couple months now. I notice no difference between it and my canon bp511. My only gripe with it is its cheazy silver plastic color, but hey, who looks at your batteries 
Bought one of these a year ago. Works about the same as the Canon battery I got with the camera. I alternate between the Canon and the Lenmar batteries and haven't noticed any difference 
I didn't think it would be, but this lens winds up on my Rebel XT most of the time. The lens is compact and performs well indoors in low light - best to use autofocus set to center point only. 35mm focal length is a nice general purpose focal length on a 1.6 crop DSLR. This lens is sharp at f2.0 and really sharp by f2.5-f2.8. I have a lot of experience and test my lenses with tripod/mirror lockup, I'm not just saying sharp at f2.0 - it IS sharp. I considered the 24mm f2.8, but f2.8 is a pretty slow prime at wider focal lengths - loses a lot of the low light advantage. I am impressed with the colors I have been getting from this lens, wasn't really expecting the colors to be so good at such a low price point - doesn't have the L lens coatings, but Canon did the colors right. The autofocus speed is pretty good - not as fast as ring USM lenses - and it is a little noisy/buzzy. I currently own 7 Canon lenses (2 Ls) including 4 primes - this 35mm is definitely a top bang-for-the-buck lens. (another is the 28-105 f3.5-4.5 USM zoom - and I don't even like zooms) Looking for a low-light prime? For 240 bucks at Amazon - just do it 
Super lightweight, sharp wide open, short minimum focus distance, fast AF. Decent bokeh. Ability to take pictures in very low light , Super cheap when compared to it's 35mm f1.4 L $1000+ brother and at 1.6 on digital its a normal lens see some shots: http://www.pbase.com/2bruce/gillin 
Bought this lens as a 'standard' prime lens for my Digital Rebel XT. What I found was that it was a fast, sharp, and lightweight lens that made the camera great for long walks. This would be the perfect lens to take to an amusement park, hiking, or biking where size and weight are a concern. I've also used this lens for macro photography and portraits where it shines. The F2 Bokeh is wonderful and center sharpness is superb even at F2, much better at F4 which is what I use most of the time. On the negative side, autofocus is noisy. To compare, it's like a drug-crazed wasp trapped in a matchbox. Maybe a mosquito buzzing close to your ear. It's not louder than the shutter, though. If this were a film camera and I was trying to take candid shots, I'd complain more, but it's a 56mm equivelant lens. Another negative is build quality. They really should make the body of this lens out of thicker plastic. No reason to skimp there as the 'feel' of the lens certainly gives you much more confidence for very little weight penalty. Make it feel solid. I've got a 52-55mm step-up ring on it as I've got a slew of 55mm filters. This also helps in that the lens cap is further from the body of the lens and easier to remove and replace. If Canon had made a faster lens in 28mm at the same price point, I would have gone that way. For my tastes, it would have been preferable to have that extra field of view assuming the quality was as good 
silver,light,sturdy..carries camera securely from the neck or on a belt 
This was delivered so fast that it was unbelievable. They sent exactly what was pictured and it works perfectly 
Was extremely pleased with the prompt service as well as the pric 
The battery pack arrived quite quickly, and we were delighted to be paying far less for it than the manufacturer was charging for a product that works just fine 
nothing wrong with this battery. personally i would prefer my camera to use AA but battery life for lithium ion batteries is pretty good. no complaints here except for the price. but necessity made me purchase a second one, not because my other one died, just cuz sometimes i need a spare 
Exceptional perfomance and long life makes this battery a great deal. Always good to have a back -up and this battery comes in handy 
I received in a short amount of time and was just what I needed. This way I am able to have my camera turned on for almost a full day using this as a backup Nothing is worse than needing that little more time to be able to get the enire family reunion and unable to add the last family into the scrapbook but this cured it all 
Battery works great, shipping from amazon took too long. I purchased other items the same day from other retailers and they were delivered 5 days sooner than the amazon item 
We bought this as a second battery for the Sony W50 digital camera. These batteries, in this camera, last a LONG time. Having a spare allows us to keep one in the external charger and swap quickly when needed. It is an original Sony product so fits and works perfectly 
The NP-BG1 type G lith pack had good picture life , but I'd carry a spare if your going to use your cameras movie feature 
I bought this for my Nikon D70 Digital SLR with 18-70mm Nikkor lens. It works great except that the lens cap does not work with the polarizer filter on. It works with the other three filters: ND4, ND8, and UV. The price still beats buying four filters individually. I like the case also 
Sure beats the price of buying a Polarizer, UV and 2 ND filters individually 
Have had this bag for a year now love it. This is what I carry in the main compartment: Nikon D50 with 18-200mm lens attached. Wide angle 10-20mm lens Depending on where I'm going - either the D50 charger, the speedlight and other little accessories OR my Canon SD550 elph with its charger. The top compartment holds extra batteries, cleaning supplies filters. The small zipper compartment on the flap is a little bit tight for anything other than a cleaning cloth, extra memory, ID's/Credit Cards. CONS: Being a woman... the strap isnt all that flattering going diagonally across the front, but I usually carry it in a sort of "1/2 slung" position or fully around in front anyway (unless I'm hiking). It could be a little snug inside if you are trying to carry alot of accessory items. Would have liked to see the padded portion of the main strap a little longer so padding is still on shoulder when bag is in the front slung position (since I carry it that way alot). PROS: Compact yet perfect fit for my camera body, 2 lens, accessories. Very snug secure on the back - easily hike, ride a bike or even a horse without fear. Had no trouble getting used to "slinging" it around front. Actually can use bag as a kind of shelf for stabilizing elbows while composing shot. Superior Lowepro design - great quality, sturdy zippers, love the rain cover. Note: I did try the slingshot 200 version 1st and found that it was just too big for my needs so exchanged it for this smaller version - no regrets, cant imagine I'll ever need another bag. 
I compared a lot of bags for use with my new Nikon D50. I wanted a bag that was versatile and could be carried on hikes. The Lowepro Slingshot is definitely the bag for my camera! Plenty of room for a couple of lens, the battery charger, and other small items. 
Just got the Slingshot 100 for my Nikon D50 with kit lens. Previously, I bought a Nikon bag but as this was just a bag to fit the camera and nothing else, I found this unpractical. The D50 fits perfectly in the slingshot 100, though I had to readjust the velcro camera compartment dividers first. This was quite disappointing as I have almost no free space in my camera compartment anymore! I guess the Canon 350D, which has a smaller body, will fit in this bag better. Anyway I have no other lenses yet (the 18-200 still on order) so that all my gear (battery, memory cards etc.) finds a place in this bag. The bag fits very well, is comfortable and is well-made. Before buying though, do check if your camera and lens will fit 
This is my first review on Amazon because I've bought products and never really felt like they deserved a review. I would say I did a thorough search for a bag that would fit me. I have a Nikon D50 with the 18-55mm lens and a 70-300mm zoom lens. I originally had a large Nikon bag that was a pain to carry around. It was inconvenient to carry and to access my camera. So when searching for a bag I wanted something that was compact, easy to carry, could hold my gear neatly and securely, and have my camera easily accessible for those moments when you want to take a quick shot and put it right back. I went to camera stores and tried on bags, looked all over the internet for reviews and finally came across the Lowepro Slingshot 100AW. It had everything that I was looking for plus more. Besides being able to hold my camera gear, it was able to hold my battery charger, cleaning supplies, extra batteries, filters, and has a built in all weather cover. Even with all of that packed I still have space for my wallet, cellphone and keys, thus freeing up my pants pockets. The great thing about the bag is that it is able to give me that extra stability when taking photos when bag is slung around to the front of me. The bag is so well designed that there's no worry about having the bag opening up and having all your expense gear fall out. The opening where you remove the camera has straps that prevent it from opening all the way by accident. All in all I am very satisfied with the bag. I would recommend it to anyone but if you have more than a couple of lenses to your photography arsenal I would upgrade to the Slingshot 200AW. 
This fit my Olympus E500 great. I recently took an overseas trip and this bag was great for traveling and on the go trips. And the weatherproof cover really came in handy a few time when it started to rain unexpectly. The only thing that was a bit odd is the strap that you can wear around your body. It comes up the chest at an odd angle, my husband didn't have a problem with it but I did. So maybe thats just a girl thing.... :) Most times I didn't use the extra strap, just threw it over one shoulder and went. The bag held 2 lenses, extra battery, charger, and I had room for keys, wallet and a few little personal odds and ends. My friend was so impressed with it, he is buying one today. Some one asked if they can attach a tripod to the bag. There aren't really any extra loops on the outside of bag. A stadard tripod won't fit insidde. You would have to rig something up on the outside yourself. IMO I don't that that it would work very well but you can try. 
This bag is very sturdy and padded. The description is pretty scanty, but I took a chance and bought it. Glad I did. The bag holds my JVC GR-DVL805U mini DV camcorder, the strap, battery, AC adaptor cord, 4 tapes, the remote, and all connector cables. It's kind of a tight squeeze with all those accesories, but the bag is compact, comfortable, and easy to carry, with the camcorder still being protected. The bag also comes with a lifetime guarantee against defect. The only thing that could be improved is that it's awkward to get the camcorder in or out of the bag while carrying it with the strap over the shoulder; the zipper is hard to reach and goes all the way around the top. That's the only thing that could be improved, and could be considered a safety feature, because the camcorder certainly won't come out unexpectedly. The bag is also very durable and nice looking. I recommend it 
Bought this Remote about a month ago. It does what it says. You can even use it from behind. Great little device for the price 
No need to run and guess whether the self-timer has already fired when I want to have a picture together with my girlfriend. Extremely useful when taking shots in low light conditions with long exposure, too. Works perfectly with my D50 
I love this remote. I find it very convenient to take self portraits and night time long exposure shots. Unfortunately I lost the remote during my trip to smokies and still have no clue how and where - might have slipped from my pocket in a hurry. I have ordered a second one now. It is so tiny that you do not feel the weight or volume in your pocket or camera bag. I wish it had a strap/thread or hole so that it can be attached to key chain or camera or etc. 
I love using it, long exposure, great for bulb. Cheap and cool. 
Works as advertised. I use it extensively for environmental work where I want to remain a short distance from my camera. It's great for portraits where I am near and concentrating on my subject and can shoot remotely without losing contact with model. The remote also came in handy for several self-promotions where I seated seating myself in an office atmosphere. 
I use it with my Nikon d50 and it works as promised. I took some long exposure shots with it last night and they came out crisp. I am also a parent and I find that using a remote is much easier than setting the timer and rangling a toddler in place within the limited window of time. I recommend this device to anyone and I find it quite affordable. Like most reviewers, I think it would have been great if it was an included accessory 
this is a wonderful filter. clean your front element, place this filter on it, and now you never have to think about it again. the thread fit is very good on both ends of it. the canon 67mm cap fits on the front of this filter perfectly. there's even a slight raised metal lip so that the cap doesn't sit against the filter glass. well engineered, and worth the money 
15 years of photography experience here... The Sigma 15mm fisheye has been extensively reviewed and compared by other websites (go ahead and search) and this is a very good product. The canon has a tighter focus and a *touch* faster in focusing, but with the massive depth of field with this lens, it's not a problem at all. Be aware that if you use this on a 1.6 crop factor digital SLR that has APS sensors like my 20D or digital rebel, then the fisheye effect is not as pronounced on film or 1.3 or full frame digital SLRs. Watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also...but that happens to any lens that has protruding or bulbous lenses. This is a much better bang for the buck lens than the canon equivalent which costs significantly more. If you search around, you can find much lower prices on this lens 
i am a fisheye lens addict. i have had this lens for a few months now, and i use it for almost everything. the lens was worth every bit i payed for it. and the sigma customer service was so fast and easy. the lens takes clear sharp pictures everytime. this lens takes the best skateboarding and band pictures! if you are considering this lens, i would definately reccomend it. i love how the pictures can either be circular or full frame. its a great investment...... 
This is my first review on here. Bought the marine pack for a houseboat trip for my Sony DSC-N1 camera. It is very solid and feels great. Somehow I mistakenly thought before obtaining it that the touchscreen could still be used when the camera was installed. Though that's not accurate, a good number of other functionality is retained (you can switch between movie/camera/review modes, zoom, etc.). It worked very well for the trip, and it took fantastic photos. We even took several movies going down water slides and diving into the water (which isn't suggested in the manuals) but still everything turned out perfectly. All in all, I'd easily recommend this unit 
The marine pack for the DSC-N1 is good enough to get the job done. The camera has a special housing setting to change the functionality of the camera so that it can be used in the case. Unfortunately, this means losing the ability to use manual settings. Luckily, the camera does fine figuring out its own settings, though occasionally to get the picture just right you need to do it yourself. I have taken the case to 130 feet several times and have never experienced a leak 
I did a lot of research in picking out a camera and wish I had known about this camera before purchasing a Nikon P3 (with WiFi). I happened to receive a refurbished SD700 right before our honeymoon and took both to test them out. What better place than Kauai to take some great shots... So, after about the first day of shooting I came to the conclusion that the Canon was a better camera hands down!!! As a matter of fact it is the best camera I've owned and I'll never get another brand again. There were several things that set this camera apart from others: 1. Picture quality on scene modes (beautiful beach and floral mode) 2. Picture quality on auto (true sign of a good camera) 3. 4X zoom (unbelievable - best feature...took pictures of a lighthouse from a mile away and looked like I was right in front taking it. I also used camera as binoculars to see a mountain goat in Wimea Canyon and picture was unbelievably clear) 4. Battery life 5. User controls and software I really can't find anything bad to say about this camera. I didn't get a chance to even read the manual before our trip and figured out all the "bells and whistles" fairly easily. As a point and shoot camera, this Canon delivers a professional quality like no other! Definitely a great purchase 
With 2 toddlers, I'm the type of person who likes to have a camera with me to capture those unexpected moments on film. The ELPH cameras are ideal for this because they're small and lightweight. I used a 3.2MP Canon ELPH before this one, and I thought the 3.2 was good until I started using this new one. The clarity and stability control on the SD700 is great! And downloading the photos to my computer takes only seconds. I highly recommend this camera 
I am not much of a photographer. I found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great. Believe me, it's the camera. The stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time. I can even put the pix up on the computer and send them easily. I'm thrilled. You do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb. memory card when you buy the camera. 
I gave this camera to my husband for his birthday. It is the first digital camera we have owned though my college age son is on his third one - all have been Canon digital Elphs. This is such a great little gadget - it is smaller than a pack of cigarettes, has a big screen on which to view your photo(s), is easy to learn to use, and great for taking on trips - as long as you remember to keep the wrist strap on your wrist while you are using it so it doesn't drop and break. I also purchased a small Canon digital printer which is great for us to take to our aging parents, take photos, print them immediately and leave them with our parents to enjoy immediately. Every Canon product we own has not disappointed us and this little camera is no exception! 
I love this camera. It does everything you'd want a compact point and shoot camera to do. Perfect for taking pictures of my toddler. Fits in your pocket and starts up in a split second. Never miss another "Kodak moment". 
Worth the money in every way. Sturdy, compact, great pictures, easy to use, easy to upload images 
It is a great compact camera with a good zoom. I can now leave a larger lens on my Nikon DX 70 and use this for closer shots. YOu do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want. I really like it for most general quick shots, carry it wth me most of the time 
No blurry pics!!!! it's wonderful. I love the different options, it's easy to use, and it's sleek and small. I do have a problem with red eye - even red eye reduction doesn't work... but it's a great little camera 
I mainly use this when taking landscape shots where I want to either make the clouds pop or liven the sky up some (remember it works best 90 degrees from the sun.) I also put it on when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes that would otherwise cause blown-out highlights. One other little secrete is to use this when shooting waterfalls since it will allow you to shoot at slower shutter speeds thus increasing the wispy waterfall look. 
Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds. There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price. If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter. There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera. Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs. What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting. Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post. If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings. Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly. I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me. When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter. Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters. I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality." Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters. This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters. PROS: Can be used for film or digital cameras Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting CONS: Bulky and heavy Not neutral color balance 
Obviously, I am enamored with the Nikon D80. As one who has extensively used the D100, D70s, and D200, I was curious as to how the D80 would "shake out" in comparison with these fine cameras. The answer is that it does very well indeed. The most obvious improvement in D80 over the D70s and D100 is the upgrade from 6.1 to 10.2 Megapixels--the same as its "Big Brother," the D200 This is not a major issue for many users, as a 6.1 MP image (uncropped) looks essentially exactly the same as a 10.2 MP image. However, if the user intends to crop images in post-processing, the larger amount of resolution becomes important--the more megapixels the more detail when images are cropped. Shooters of wildlife, for example, will appreciate the additional resolution of the D80, as it is often necessary to photograph wildlife at a distance and then crop the image to cause the subject to dominate the frame. The other very obvious D80 improvements are the larger viewfinder and larger rear-LCD. These are very welcome improvements, also borrowed from the D200. The viewfinder is wide, bright, and a literal joy to use. Combined with the 11-point autofocus system (basically the same as that of the D200 although with some differences in options) the viewfinder makes the D80 a powerhouse camera for moving subjects, or for framing the subject in places other than the center of the image. The autofocus is fast and sure. I literally never use manual focus with the D80--the autofocus is just too good not to use for almost every conceivable situation. The 2.5 inch rear LCD is bright and vivid--a joy to use. This too, as mentioned above, is borrowed from the D200. The menu selections in the D80 closely track those of the D200 and are largely pretty intuitive for anyone who is somewhat familiar with the Nikon system. A few nits. First of all, the D80 does not have a selection for focus-priority continuous focus mode. This is unfortunate, as such an option (present on the D200) allows fast action shots using continuous-focus with surety that the subject is, in fact, in focus. Happily, this absence (which I predict and hope Nikon will correct in a later firmware revision) is not a huge loss. I have shot hundreds of images of fast-flying birds using continuous focus with the D80 and the images are almost all perfectly focused. The user can trust the D80 in continuous focus mode, focus priority or no. Nikon chose to equip the D80 with SD cards rather than CF cards. Why Nikon did this is a mystery to many of us as the D80 clearly is an upgrade to the wonderful D70s, which uses CF cards. Further, the D80 is a fantastic backup camera for D200 users, and the D200, of course, also uses CF cards rather than SD cards. CF cards would have been a more logical choice in my opinion for the D80. Fortunately, the cost of these media is dropping so fast that this is less of an issue than it would have been a few years ago. The D80 sucks up power a lot faster than the D70s. That 2.5 inch LCD entails higher power use as a price. Most users will want to own a spare battery. As to ergonomics, the D80 is terrific! I have just finished an 8 day stay on Maui, Hawaii, during which my D80 was literally always with me. The weight of the camera is low, and its bulk, reasonable. There is no digital SLR I would rather carry for an extended period than the compact D80. The placement of the various controls is excellent, and pretty intuitive. The quality of the D80 body construction is standard Nikon-Prosumer grade, which is to say, excellent albeit not as heavy-duty as the metal-body D200. Overall, the D80 is destined to become one of the great Nikon cameras that will find a place with users all over the world 
It doesn't get any better at this price point. Excellent build quality, very easy to use, and intuitive. The optics are simply brilliant for a kit lense (135MM). Went from a Canon Rebel film SLR which I loved, but when I tried to move into the XTi, there was just no comparison between the XTi and the D80. You could immediately feel the difference in quality and functionality. And the auto-clean feature is absolute marketing crap from Canon. THe CMOS shakes off the dust, but then where does the dust go? Bologna feature, not to mention the Flash nearly knocks your eye out when it pops up on the Canon XTi. The D80 blows it away, and for it's price there is nothing out there better. If your in the market at this price point, or relatively close, just go for it. You WILL NOT regret this purchase. 
You are reading a non technical review from your average fun photographer. So don't expect a lot of technical stuff. I finally stepped up from a Fuji S9000. I have loved my Fuji cameras ease of use and the colors they produce. I was a little reluctant to spend the kind of money it takes to get into the D80. I am thrilled I did. I finally have a digital camera that when the kids do something I catch it as opposed to the camera taking the shot after they have left the room. Super fast. A few Saturdays ago I was outside in our wooded back yard taking pictures of the changing colors in the trees. When I went to take a shot the flash popped up. I said this isn't right the sun in filtering though the trees but I took the shot anyway. Wow the camera new what to do. Unbelievable photos. Easy to handle even with the pistol grip MB D80. I also sprung for the SB600 flash and a great two dvd training program on Ebay. So don't be afraid to spend a couple of grand for the D80 and accesories. You will be glad you did. Happy in Alabam 
I recently test drove a D200 and was impressed with the useabiity of the camera. It is almost perfect. When buying I opted for the D80 because it has a very similar feature-set for less cash. Which meant additional money for lenses. OK, it doesn't shoot 5fps or have the alloy body with weather seals, but it does have the sensor and useability. It is light, quick and a joy to use. Changing settings such as ISO, WB and flash is almost as easy as the D200. This is a fine camera. And it uses SD cards - much more preferable than CF in my opinion. Worth every penny 
I just purchased this camera and lens (with another lens in a different set) and it has blown me away so far. The pictures have been just incredible. The focus, metering, exposure, flash, color balance... Everything is perfect so far. I have mainly used the camera in full automatic mode and it really shines. Its as simple as a point and shoot in this mode. I have used the camera in difficult lighting situations and the photos have been incredible. There is no noticeable shutter lag, which is very important to me. I have a 6 yo son who goes from smiling one moment to looking away the next. I have missed so many photos in the past due to shutter lag, but that is not a problem with this camera. Another feature that helps is the continuous mode. I can take 3 pics a second for up to 100 pics and then select the best. Generally I find I can get a good pic in like 10-15 photos. I used to be a serious photo hobbist during the days of film, but always had problems finding a darkroom to develop my film. The darkroom issue and the shear cost of film and paying for processing made me abandon the hobby. But this camera is really bringing back the excitement of this hobby again without the trials and expense of the darkroom. The only downside in this camera is the price, but in this instance, you get what you pay for. You might be able to save a buck or two with another camera, but I wouldn't even try. I can't imagine a camera taking a better picture. By the way, I love this lens. The 18 to 55 mm focal length is a nice every day lens. Its much wider angle then you find on the point and shoot cameras, yet you can still get close. I have a 55-200 mm lens as well, but I find I use the 18-55 lens more. The shorter lens is great in confined spaces, where you can't easily back away from the subject, and its always better to move closer to your subject than use a long lens (unless you can't for safety reasons). My only regret is waiting so long to get a DSLR camera of this quality. It has really opened up a old hobby for me. 
This camera is awesome! I upgraded from my D50 for the better sensor and more MP. Wow - am I amazed at the increase in quality. Say goodbye to that digital look. The extras are a lot of fun and I've only begun to play. B/W with various filters to name one. Very worth the money 
I've been looking at Digital SLRs ever since Canon came out with its 10D. Since then, there have been so many by so many companies. I've always been a Canon user. I have had 2 EOS bodies-the Elan IIE and the 7E. And also the Canon IX, its APS camera which I still have (its small viewfinder was a major disappointment). Anyhow the 30D came along, and its viewfinder was small too. The camera was still too large for me, and I just wasn't sold. Now the Nikon D80. It is narrower than the Canon 30D, and what is breathtaking is the panoramically big viewfinder. Such a delight to use. The 2.5" LCD seems to fit perfectly in the back: nothing bigger or smaller would be right. The pictures are fabulous. I bought a 2 GB Sandisk Ultra II card, which I thought would be fast. It takes about a half second for the picture to come on the LCD, but I'm not complaining. 2 GB is a big card. It can hold 500 photos using the Normal JPEG, large image. I'm sure the 1 GB would be faster. On the Canons, the onboard flashes never would use the advanced metering that the external flashes provided, but with the Nikon D80, I see such perfectly illuminated photos with the onboard flash. The 18-135 lens is something I jumped for. 28-200 in 35 mm size is quite a huge range, and yet the lens is not massive. I thought hard about the Image stablization you could get with the Canon 18-85 IS lens, but naaah, the 30D just does not measure up so I dropped that idea. There are always such things called tripods!! The entire camera, lens and battery feel just right, and not too heavy. The lens is excellent. The kit fits nicely into a relatively small Lowepro bag. This truly has been a camera worth waiting years for. 12 or 14 MP models are sure to come along in a couple of years, but I doubt that they can make the bodies any more compact; the file size is large enough as it is with 10 mega-pixel. The D80 is so perfect in shape I doubt Nikon can do much better. This is one fantastic digital SLR. Raj 
I was in the market to buy a new camera last year and walked into BestBuy alone just browsing. I have an older EOS Canon Rebel 35mm Camera from 1992, and I loved that camera too. So this was my second camera purchase, and was not sure what I wanted, but I knew what I wanted to take pictures of. I take this camera everywhere, vacations, visiting friends and family, take pictures of scenery, sporting events, and people. There are a lot of options on this camera that I don't know how to use, but can't wait to learn them too. I upgraded my memory card to 1 GB so I can take a lot of pictures and not have to worry about running out of room. When I travel or go to a sporting event, I take anywhere from 75 to 200 piictures. I get a lot of compliments on the camera and the photos it takes are great 
This camera has been called a "pro-sumer" model and you should really take that title seriously. The quality of the pictures that it takes are just as good as a professional digital camera of the same resolution. The trade off is that it is really not happy being thrown in a bag (or big pocket, if it fits). Why? Because Canon have given it a really annoying power-on switch that is guaranteed to turn the camera on 90% of the time when you're moving it to or from a bag. To compound this problem, the lens extends (in your bag), pushing off the lens cap and leaving it open for possible damage. So, if you think of this as a professional camera, to be kept in a real camera-case, you'll probably be okay. If you're somebody, like me, who likes to throw his camera in a bag or pocket, you're going to be annoyed by the power switch. That said, I do LOVE the quality of the pictures and all control that the camera gives you over every aspect of taking them. CONS: stupid power-on switch that always catches and turns camera on; lens cap is kind of loose and falls off easily; widest angle is maybe a little too telephoto still (around 35mm?) PROS: awesome pictures; tons of controls all over the outside of the camera allowing you to control a lot without having to resort to menus; professional features including flash hot-shoe and replaceable lens; great battery life; awesome picture 
The Canon G6 is a great camera. I upgraded from a Canon Powershot A80 to the G6. The A80 showed me that Canon makes a good camera, but was lacking a few features I really wanted. To me, this camera is a perfect collection of compromises. I want a small camera for family snapshots, that's easy to use. I want a large, capable camera for art work like portraits and landscape, and action shots like sports and recreation. When I'm on vacation, and want some snaps of the kids goofing around or of dinner or something, I don't need a camera that makes me jump through hoops to get a decent shot, I just want to point and shoot. In full auto, or aperature priority, or shutter speed priority, the pictures are usually sharp and crisp. Set the image size to one of the medium or small settings and you can use the high speed multi-shot feature to get a series of action shots that guarantee that you'll get at least a few good ones. I have no qualms about setting this camera to auto, handing this camera to a person with little or no photgraphic experience, and letting them click away. It's easy enough to learn that most folks can be taking nice pictures in less than an hour, and pros can be taking great pictures in no time at all. On the other hand, a lot of the work I do is very artistic, and involves using manual settings. When going for the perfect picture, it is often necessary to adjust the focus, aperature, and shutter speed to get the exact picture you want. This camera has manual focus, a feature I sorely missed on my older Powershot A80. Another thing that bothers me on most other cameras, is that you have to wade through a bewilderingly large collection of menu options to make the smallest changes. While I can understand using a layer or two of menus for things like basic settings (time, format a CF card) I can't see it for something as basic as film speed or white balance. Which is why I love this camera. The following items are one button away: Flash Flash Output Level Multi-image Time delay photo Autofocus area Macro mode Manual Focus White Balance Zoom in / out Film Speed (50 to 400) Picture mode (auto, Manual, Manual preset 1 and 2, Av, Tv, Portratit, Landscape, Backlit, Panorama, movie) My favorite things about this camera: Battery life is excellent. I bought a spare battery, but I've never actually use the one that came with it in less than a day. It charges fast too. Picture quality: The larger lens allows for better pictures in low light conditions, and it is very clear. The large CCD allows you to get pictures in a large enough resolution to print out fairly large copies and have them look very good. Ergonomic. This is a very comfortable camera to hold for a long time. It's not quite in the same range as some much more expensive units, but I've never gotten tired from holding it. Plus, all the buttons you need to hit while running it are right there under your fingertips. The scroll wheel under your right index finger is very intuitive to operate. Push it to change modes, roll it to change the settings. The fold out screen allows you to take pictures from odd angles without ever having to lay down on your back for a picture. Plus, the fold out screen feels very solidly built, not like it'll snap off in your hands. I was always worried about my Powershot A80, as it didn't feel very solid. It works well with my computer, which runs Linux. I use gtkam, a great camera program It has an infrared remote that can be used to take pictures without worrying about camera shake. This is very useful for group pictures you'd like to be in yourself. User savable white balance settings. Real flash shoe. This camera takes a standard Canon flash unit. Manual focus mode puts a close up of the center of the screen right in the middle of the picture for you to check the focus with. This would be really bothsome for composing pictures, except that when you half depress the shutter button, the small zoomed square in the center disappears and leaves you with the whole picture. The rapid fire photo option is very useful for action shots, and some candid stuff, like subway pictures. The mechanical view finder is more than just an adornment on this camera. It's quite good, and it changes its field of view according to the current zoom setting. It also has a focus adjustment on it. This is very nice if you wear glasses, as it lets you adjust the view finder to your eye, and you can get your eye right up to it, and not keep bumping your glasses into the back of the camera. Very wide open Fstop of 2.0 to very closed off 8.0. And lastly, it remembers virtually everything you setup the last time it was on or in a certain mode, and reverts to those settings the next time you turn it on or switch modes. This includes things like white balance, settings that were NOT remembered by my Powershot A80. Now for the negatives: The door that covers the USB port / DC input, and AV output is very easy to catch in the swivelling / revolving fold out screen, and as the screen takes a fare bit of effort to revolve, it's quite likely you'll have snapped the door in half before you notice it's gone and gotten itself caught in the spinning LCD screen that's passing by. If it's gotten a little bent, it will get caught every time by the fold out screen until you snap it off or bend it back in place. The flash is way too close to the lens, which makes for some pretty obvious shadows in the bottom right hand corner of some photos. Luckily, I'm not much for flash usage, and if I was, I'd probably spring for a real flash that sat in the hot shoe. Still, if you're looking for a great built in flash, this is NOT the camera for you. Slow focus, and the autofocus can become confused by objects within a few yards, and never really focus. Plus, focusing is pretty slow. If you are looking for a camera with a very fast, nearly perfect autofocus, you might do better with another camera. Movies are limited to 3 minutes maximum, which seems rather arbitrary. Even 5 minutes would be a big step up, as it would allow me to catch the average musical performance in one step. Final Word: This is a great compromise camera for someone who really wants two separate cameras but can't afford them. It's a good snap shot camera, and a good big lense, big body, big CCD machine capable of creating art. It's not the best at either of those categories when compared to other cameras, but for one that does both, it represents a a perfect compromise at a pretty reasonable price 
Incredible quality and zoom! Low power consumption. Buy the 1GB SanDisk compact flash card. It gives you plenty of room for a 2-3 week vacation 
A camera more for the advanced photographer with a very detailed instruction booklet. Takes excellent photos in auto mode. Memory chip included is not near big enough 
This is my third digital camera, but it's been a few years since the second and it was definitely obsolete. I was tempted to go top of the line, because I've two excellent SLRs (Nikon and Minolta) with all the trimmings, but the prices made that unfeasible right now. I'm very satisfied with the features of the Canon G6 however; I've taken about 400 shots so far, plus one movie, tried out all the software for stitching panoramas together, etc. I still mainly use PhotoShop, but the Canon software is quite good. The photo quality is excellent, including color and the optical zoom and wideangle range is good for most purposes. The macro setting also does a nice job. The controls are easy to use for the most part for anyone at all familiar with full featured SLRs, and better than most. I've made very few mistakes in the field as a result of control confusion. What I'm less thrilled about (nitpicking): Like most electronics these days, even if you've got very small hands like me, it is hard to keep from getting a finger in the wrong place, just about every square inch is covered with a control. I would have liked to have an insert (like Nikon supplies) to cover the flash hotshoe contacts. And every time I remove the battery or memory card, I have to watch out to grab the camera by the few areas that don't have a control on them. Also, the cable input has a typical tiny plastic door that would be all too easy to break off, and the neck strap attachment is too close to the memory card door, and tends to interfere with it opening all the way. Also, in preview mode it tells you how many shots you have taken but not how many left, and in shooting mode, vice versa. It is annoying to have to switch to shooting mode to see how many left, especially if you are using the lens cover, because then the lens deploys out, and you have to remember to take the lens cover off first (deploying the lens with the cover on is a no-no.) I also got the camera case designed for the G6. Again like all too many "cases" it is a tight fit, only has a single inside pocket that you can only get an extra card in and still get the camera in too. And the case would not really be good dust protection and it zips up the sides but the top opening is just covered by a flap. And because of the tight and awkward fit, it is easy to accidentally turn the camera on, deploying the lens, while putting the camera into the case. The case comes with a belt loop, but you have to supply your own belt, and it has no other strap or handle except a tiny loop located at the top end of on side zipper, where it just gets in the way. Not a good design. I also checked out some of the accessories available, like additional lens and flash, but they're very expensive, like the macro lights are more than the camera! So I don't know if I'll get any of the add-ons later on. But overall, the G6 is already my next favorite camera to my Nikon SLR, powerful yet easy to use, and even fun! Definitely 5 stars for the camera, 1 star for the case 
I received the lenses and they were all good quality. The case that comes with them is also very nice. I was worried about the polarizing lens not working after reading the other reviews,but mine worked fine. 
Great kit! I haven't used any filters before but I can tell that I'll be using these quite a bit 
This was an outstanding value. The kit includes three often needed filters as well as an excellent filter wallet. The wallet itself, along with the included Tiffen Booklet is an added extra value. I found it to be a great value for the money. You get all three for less than the price of one filter and the filter wallet is an added bonus. 
These are great filters and especially for the price! I was looking for just one UV filter, and after stumbling upon this set which was not much more than the price of one filter, I bought it. These are great lenses. I especially like the polarizing filter, but all 3 are great. definitely a worthy buy 
After getting the SD600 as a gift, I knew I had to get a case for it. I really didn't like any of the cases at the store and wanted something that has a custom fit. This case is completely solid and the camera fits snugly in it. I have no problem taking the camera in or out but it does not have any wiggle room while it is in the case. Also the case has a magnetic button close for added security. Overall, a great buy 
This camera case is exactly what I was looking for. It fits my Canon SD600 perfectly. It fits like a glove- not too big, not too snug, and it does not scratch the LCD screen. It's really cute and is a nice punch of color in contrast to the basic black that is every other camera case out there. I've gotten a lot of compliments on how cute it is. I definitely recommend this product! 
This case is perfect for carrying and protecting my camera. Can't imagine not having it 
Just what I expected, since this is the second one I have purchased. I have one, and bought a camera and this case for my daughter. The case protects the camera lcd screen, but is still small enough to fit in a pocket or easily in a purse 
love it, it fits my SD450 perfectly. it's snug and durable and fits great in my purse when i bring it with me. i definitely recommend this!! 
I love this product! The case is slim enough to carry around in a purse without taking up all the room. The red color is fun, too! 
this case is freaking awesome. i was completely turned off by the 8 dollars shipping i had to pay, but it was definetly worth it. this case looks so nice, so sleek, so beautiful and it just feels good in your hands. u will love this case. i did. borrow a dollar from 8 ppl if u have to just for shipping 
I like the color. It fits the camera perfectly. It's really cute and not bulky. It's not just the ordinary black camera case that everyone else has. It's classy 
after searching on the internet i found amazon to be the place where this item had the lowest price. fast delivery, great product. fits great with my panasonic 6 megapixels camera. fine leather. could not be any happier with the product 
Need to clean your Digital SLR's sensor? This is the besy way to do it -- in conjunction wtih Sensor Swabs -- as canned compressed air can add "junk" which can make your sensor worse 
Great Kit, and I use it a lot. First, here's what's inside. SMALL rocket blower - great little thing, tends to whistle through the red plastic tip though. so, it's not great in quiet places. Retractable brush - great little thing, tends to shed hairs, but not terribly. Cleaning Solution - i did notice it lifted some color off of a multicoated lens. oddly, it only did that on one lens, and only once. the lens looks fine, and still takes sharp pictures without any flare. jury's out, but i still use it w/o fear. Cotton Swabs - never used em, but they look nice. Microfiber cloth - nice full sized cloth. very soft, and great when buffing out the spots 
Don't buy this camera really. I had it for a month and was taking good care of it. I was initially thrilled. The LCD screen got damaged -- no I didn't drop it. The treatment from customer service was so poor and disturbing that I was shocked. The customer service representative actually questioned my integrity and proceed to talk to me as if I were an idiot. A $181 repair bill for a $300 camera is not feasible. It was a great camera at first, but I demand better treatment and respect from the company. Look for a better camera, look on the web for comments on their customer service and don't buy this camera. I had read very negative things about Sony but didn't think they applied -- they really are true. I don't like being called a liar by anyone especially when I am the customer. The camera is a month old and it is now garbage. While I understand policies are policies in terms of a warranty, I will not accept such poor treatment and customer service. I teach photography and will tell my students the same thing -- if customer service and respect matter to you, then do not buy this camera. 
i have another camera w/ 12x optical tons of features but i wanted something compact ready to take quick snaps. this fits the bill. on my recent vacation i was impressed with how quickly it booted up and focused in to get those unplanned shots. the x-large screen makes it really easy to see if you got a good one and the image stabilisation seems to work better than on my previous camera (canon A80)...either that or my hand is steadier. last but not least - the battery life was impeccable. I took a nearly 200 photos, plus spent a lot of time reviewing and showing off pics to friends with no need to recharge. the battery is a 'custom' one which concerned me but the charger is VERY compact and travels well. it has integrated prongs that fold flat when not in use - no cables :) 
This little camera may be small (great feature) but it is loaded this goodies. This is my first adventure into digital photography and I would recomend this one to any first time user. Very easy and lots of fun to use. 
I absolutely love this camera. I've told everyone I know to buy it. The picture quality is amazing. There are so many options with this tiny little camera! You can edit pictures before you even print them. Zoom in on a picture already taken and save it that way, and so much more. I take pictures of everything! I charged the battery when I got the camera, which was about three weeks ago, and it's still going. I have 7/8th of battery life left. I haven't had to charge it again. I am so happy with my purchase! I hope this helps you 
This camera is very slim like the Canon Elphs but costs much less. It has very high resolution and is easy to use. The battery lasts a long time and the 2.5" LCD screen is very clear and big. It has a lot of different shooting modes, including a custom mode where you can set specific parameters like infinity lock or ISO speed. For convenience, every time you switch modes, the screen tells you what the mode should be used for, so you don't need to carry around a manual to figure out how to shoot your pictures. 
I wanted to buy a compact slim d-camera. Those with larger zoom are quite bulky, you can't carry around all the time. I think a slim camera is a better choice. I slip into my pocket while wondering around and come across something nice and take a picture of it. You can't do it with a huge camera. After I made up mind about a slim camera, my choices were either Casio Exilim or Sony DSCW series. Casio Exilims are very sexy. They have a lot of mode scenes. They also function as voice recorder. You can take pictures of book pages etc. They have anti-shake capability which is said to reduce blurred images. I was almost buying a Casio Exilim. Being a diligent person I wanted to search more and more. I found out that the so-called anti-shake feature is a bogus. Many people found it useless. That was a good reason to choose Casio. Then I found the picture quality of Exilim is not really good.I found some pictures taken with Exilim. They were soft, not crisp colors. Search the web reviews made by photo professionals. Casio Exilim is rated significantly less than Sony in picture quality. With ISO 200 noise was still detectable in most reviews . Those same reviewers however found Sony DSCW doing a better job . There was no noise with ISO 400 which means even in lower light condition Sony did a better job (less granularity in pictures with low light). Big difference!. One feature of Sony that made it very attractive was its strong macro. It is 0.74 inch which means you can bring your camera 0.74 inch (2 mm) close to an object (say a bug) and still take a brilliant picture of it. Now comparison of Exilim and Sony to summarize: Casio Exilim Anti-shake (it's a bogus) Slim Lower macro (2.5 inches) Lower picture quality (detectable noise at ISO 200) A lot of scene modes Quick shutter Sony DSCW Series Slim (in fact it is slimmer) Higher macro (0.74 inches) Higher picture quality (No noise in ISO 400) Not a lot of scene modes Quick shutter So.....I purchased a Sony DSCW 7 Mp. I took lots of pictures. They are all brilliant, detailed and crisp, true colors. I tried macro and took pictures of bugs. You can see the hairs on the legs of bugs. Absolutely no noise whatsoever, no blurry. It's a marvel of technology. I took pictures of fireworks in July 4th using high ISO setting. They came out brialliantly like professional pictures. It also uses a different kind of battery that you can't buy at your grocery which can leave you vulnerable. So you may wanna buy a spare one (about 40 bucks). But you can always recharge it. And it lasts much much longer than AAA or Nimh batteries. It was a perfect choice. I highly recommend it. 
PROS: - The picture quality is very good, but a 7.2 megapixel picture is about 3mb wich is pretty big and thats a reason you might want to buy a bigger memory card. - Big 2.5" LCD that can get you some attention from bystanders around you. - The video mode in High Quality is very good! This feature impressed me, and i use it the most ( depening on the occasion ). This camera has better resolution than my brothers sony camera recorder. For some reason my baterry seems to drain a little faster than taking pictures. ( I own a 2GB Memory Stick Pro Duo, wich is enough to record and take pictures for a day, but i don't think the battery will hang in) CONS: - There isn't that many cons for me, becuase i was looking for a point and shot camera with a 2.5" LCD or 3" - The only thing i didn't like about video mode is that you can't zoom while recording, other than that this camera is a nice and great pocket camera. - Pictures come out blury at times when you are really shaky but sony does a pretty good at image stabilization. (This is also a great sport camera wich you can capture pitures of a fast moving object. 
I originally had the Sony DCS W50 but returned it to get the W70. Pros 7.2 Megapixel Small and Light High Quality VGA Video Recording with sound 3X Optical Zoom Optical Viewfinder, you'd be surprised how many companies are doing away with the optical viewfinder Great Battery Life Big LCD Display Cons Non-Standard USB port on the camera Pro-Duo Memory Card, come on Sony! SD Cards own the market No QVGA Video mode. VGA (640x480) is really nice, the low quality mode 160x112 is also a good feature to have but why not QVGA (320x240), it would of been a nice to have that extra feature. Sony I am very impressed The negatives of the camera are negligible in the long run, sure I would of liked an SD card slot, but Pro Duo cards are coming down in price. The quality of the photos are incredible. The camera is small and sleek. This camera also offers several different photosizes. 7 MP, 3:2 (6 MP), 5 MP, 3 MP, 2 MP, VGA, 16:9 (2 MP). All the standard features, Macro (which is incredible), red-eye reduction, low light, etc. There are three other camera's in Sonys W Line. The DSC W30 and W50 which are both 6 MP cameras, and the W100 which is an 8 MP Camera. As I stated before I originally had the Sony W50, the 6 megapixel version, but decided that I should of spend the extra $50 for the 7 MP one. The LCD is prone to fingerprints, but they are easily wiped off. For the price and the quality this camera is a steal all other 7 MP cameras are currently much more expensive 
We really like this camera! It's a WHOLE lot better than our previous one, which ran off 4 AA batteries, and ran THROUGH so many AA batteries so quickly that we can't even guess how many $$ that wasted. This Optio camera uses very nice rechargable batteries that cost $5 each through Ebay (don't buy them here on Amazon... ouch!) We've got 3 batteries and are getting two more so that we never even have to worry about power while on a long trip. (The really handy travel charger is also awesome... get it on Ebay for just a few bucks.) The startup time and shutter speed are very fast, so catching quick pictures is finally possible for us. (My wife no longer threatens to go back to film after using this camera!) Our last camera would take so long to focus that we never got the candid shots we wanted. The one and only thing that's even a slight problem with this camera is the power button being next to the shutter button. (What clueless engineer thought THAT would be good??) However, now that we've used it a lot, we never hit the button by accident. All other features of the camera are great. With a 1 GB memory card, we've never ever run out of memory space, even with taking lots of short videos and many many pictures on medium quality. Great camera, worth every cent. Buy the accessories on Ebay and you'll find that getting everything you need is not very expensive at all. (Actually, we bought the camera on Ebay too, but these reviews are great here on Amazon. Thanks, Amazon! 
this is a great camera for traveling, it is small enough to fit into your top pocket, so it can go anywhere. the only problem that i have is that there is no underwater housing for it, if there was i would have given it a 5* 
I have been through 6 cameras in the past 3 years, of all different kinds of brands and price. I have changed so many times because they get stolen or broken...this little pentax optio was surprising though! 3 months after having it around, i brought it to the desert and it got some sand in it, but I had it fixed. THis same camera also fell three floors down and nothing was damaged; neither the screen, the lens, nor the flash. it just got cracked a bit and twisted, and the battery/memory card cover is completely damaged, but it still works like it should! 
I have had this camera a year now and am VERY impressed. I have used Nikon 35mm SLR's all my life so I was a little hesitant going into digital. Lugging around equipment became too much of a issue so I started looking. Picture quality is great even at full optical zoom. I very rarely use the digital zoom. Most impressive...the camera has taken 2 direct hits on the concrete and (8 months ago) and still works perfectly! 
I hear a lot of grumbling about the camera not being "perfect." But guess what ... in this size and form factor one should not be expecting SLR-like performance. I just purchased this camera last week and have been busy testing it out in a variety of situations. The "Full Auto" mode does a pretty decent job of figuring out the right settings for most situations. If you want you can take total control and set most controls manually. There are even a bunch of pre-programmed setting for different lighting situations and the couple that I tested worked great. All in all, great camera for the size. I like the fact that I can put this in my shirt pocket and forget about it and then when I suddenly need to take a picture I always have the camera handy. I have a normal speed SD Memory card and writing out the images to the card can be painfully slow. This is especially true when trying to take a number of quick shots in rapid succession. The wait for the camera to become ready to take the next shot is annoying. I would highly recommend that you purchase one of the high speed SD cards (often advertised as "Ultra II" or "32X" or "High Speed." All in all a great camera and if you are realistic with your expectations you will be very happy. Good luck 
I bought this camera a couple months ago because I wanted a small digital camera that would be easy to carry with me. Since then, I've found the S5i to be a wonderful camera that takes clear colorful pictures and can easily fit in your pocket. Here are some praises for the S5i: 1. This camera is TINY. It is smaller than my cellphone. This makes it extremely easy to bring with when going on a trip or just out for the day. I have it in my pocket at all times, ready to capture any moment. I brought it with on a recent trip and everybody thought it was great. At the end of the day we hooked it up to the TV in the hotel and watched a slide show of the day. Everyone loved it. 2. The battery life in incredible. I have had this thing for a couple months and I have only charged it like 4 times. Even with extended use of the flash and screen, the battery still keeps kicking. Very different from my cellphone! 3. The super macro focus setting creates beautiful photos. This was something I didn't realize the camera had until after I bought it. You can get right up to things and take these really colorful and crisp images. Flowers and plants look incredible. 4. The red-eye reduction is the best I've ever seen. With the red-eye flash mode, the camera flashes once and then about a second later flashes again and takes the picture. None of my pictures suffer from red-eye anymore. The flash is also very powerful. 5. It has many manual settings for more artistic pictures. I still haven't even gotten to check out all the little features this camera comes with. It has a lot of different "scene" presets and also allows you to do manual mode (with focus exposure). Overall, this camera met and exceeded all the expectations I had. I would definitely recommend the Pentax S5i to a family member or friend. 
I just got this camera a month ago and I am satisfied with it. It has a lot of features despite its size. And for point and shoot I can say it's a great buy, comparable to other power packed cameras, it even takes better pictures sometimes. But I just had to give it a 4 because I thought I could do more with it. But you can't do much with the settings since it has it's own default settings for certain conditions. But over all it's a great camera. If you're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek, this is definitely a good buy. 
I've had this camera since just before Christmas 04. I purchased from www.bhphotovideo.com for about $350. I should have waited until after the holidays, because the price has come down. It is great to finally have a small camera. I often forget that I even have it with me (which I guess can be bad!). Over all the pictures are good. The focus is sometimes soft. It doesn't take good night photos, but takes great daytime pics 
A very good accessory to have, protects the lens, and helps in taking very good pictures in some special situations 
I'll keep this short,as I assume most of the tec stuff has been covered.I sold a 350D to get the 400D(XTi).The 400D focuses better,has better ergonomics,is the same size/weight,and takes GREAT photos.I tried a Nikon D80,but it loses way too much detail at iso 400 and up.Plus the Canon line of lenses fits my needs better,are cheaper,and are available.The Nikon costs $300 more (with the Canon being discounted),and the Nikon Raw converter adds another $150.So the true cost difference is $400-450. I'd buy the Canon over the Nikon at the same price due to image quality,especially if you shoot jpeg. BTW,if you can afford Canon L lenses(the 25-105L and the 70-200L-any of the 4) are amazing. One caveat,as with ANY dslr,these cameras are not p/s and do best with some post processing and with knowledge of how a camera meters/exposes,etc.I can't emphasize this enough 
I had the Rebel XT and about 8 lenses and was thinking of getting an upgraded second camera body. So when it came out the 30D was a logical choice, but it was not really much of an upgrade from the 20D, which I resisted, so I was not really sure what to do. Then I had all but decided to just take the plunge and get the 30D when I heard the first rumblings about the XTi. Then I started to learn the details about the XTi, more mega pixels, same auto focus, same screen, picture styles, dust cleaning! The only areas that the 30D won in my opinion were build quality, spot meter, and estimated shutter life. Those 3 categories were not enough to convince me that the 30D was worth $300-$400 more than the XTi especially since the XTi had won or tied in most categories. The way I look at it is that the camera bodies are not nearly as important as the lenses, they change so fast that it is not worth it to me to spend more for longevity when it will be outdated in a year anyway. Spend $1,500 on a lens, use it for a lifetime, spend $1,500 on a camera body, regret it in a year. I fully expect the upgrade to the 30D to be released within a year, and now that I have saved by getting the XTi I will have all that much more to put towards it when it comes out. So basically what I am saying is that, in my opinion, the XTi is just as good, if not better than the semi-pro 30D, so why pay more? Switching from the XT to the XTi was very simple, I can use them both now without any problems. The batteries, battery grips, remote shutter release, and most of the other accessories are also compatible with both, which is nice to keep the amount of gear you need to carry to a minimum. Unless you want to move up to a full frame sensor, I can't see any reasons why you would not want to go with this camera. If you read books on photography from just 1 or 2 years ago you will realize that this "entry level" camera has features that were not even available on top of the line ($5,000+) camera bodies. With the speed that camera bodies advance you might as well buy the entry level body every year instead of making a huge investment in the pro level bodies and then being shown up by something 10% of that price in a year or two. Not that there are not reasons to buy one of those bodies, I just don't seem have any of them 
With emphasis on portability, Canon's Digital Rebel XTi is designed for first-time DSLR photographers and travel enthusiasts. Measuring 5.0" by 3.7" by 2.6" and weighing 1.1 lbs., it is about as large as the largest point shoot cameras and one of the smallest DSLR camera bodies on the market. Its size is the source of both popularity and criticisms. If you have large hands or a heavier lens, it may feel too small. An optional battery grip can help, but some will want something more substantial. Visit a store nearby to find out for yourself. The package includes camera body with a lens cap, battery, charger, manual, catalogs, neck strap, USB and composite video cables, and CD-ROMs. You will need a lens and CompactFlash memory card. There may be some static energy in the packaging, so remove the lens cap in a dust-free environment such as the bathroom to prevent dust entering the sensor. Much promoted sensor cleaning system helps, but it's best not to get any in the first place. Canon sells 4 versions of XTi: black or silver finish and with or without EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens. Black or silver is largely a personal preference, but most lenses, most accessories, and all but low-end DSLR camera bodies are black. As for the kit lens, it can be an affordable introduction to DSLR and capable if used exclusively at f/8 or f/11 apertures (soft at other apertures). In other words, the lens is not ideal for shooting under low light. If you don't have to get a zoom lens now, start with Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II. It is famous for top-notch performance at very low price. Due to XTi's APS-C image sensor (compositions are multiplied by 1.6x), this lens becomes 35mm-equivalent of 80mm. If you have the budget for a good zoom lens, at over 100 lenses, Canon has you covered. Some of Canon's popular zoom lenses include EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM, EF 17-40mm f/4L USM, EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM, and EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM. If these are too pricey, third party vendors such as Sigma and Tamron make Canon-compatible lenses for less. Their focus is not as nice as Canon's USM but they generally outperform Canon's lower-end lenses.Tamron's SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 Di II LD Aspherical (IF) and Sigma's 18-50mm f/2.8 EX DC and AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC macro are popular among budget-minded photographers. With 10.1 megapixels image sensor, the XTi can benefit from sharper lenses. Although increasing the resolution over same image sensor area can increase noise, Canon has improved the sensor technology to maintain low noise floor and high dynamic range. Performance wise, there's very little to criticize. Great example of Canon's trademark smooth, high contrast, saturated, and low noise. Noise remains low even at ISO 800. It is said that shooting RAW is equivalent to getting an extra exposure (1.0 EV) and it can help you maintain usable details with acceptable noise at ISO 1600. Low noise gives XTi a bit of an excuse for missing in-body image stabilizer. According to Canon, lens is more effective location for image stabilizer, especially telephoto. That's true but I think the feature would've been nice to have. As a consolation, the XTi has mirror lockup that reduces vibration caused by the mirror movement. My sole performance criticism is the metering mode. It includes only partial and not spot metering mode (very useful when shooting high contrast scenes such as candlelit birthday cake). Perhaps more problematic is the evaluative metering mode, which occasionally underexposes images by 2/3 EV or so. Some have criticized XTi for "plasticky" build. Except for the metal lens mount, the exterior is largely made of high quality engineering plastic with rubbery paint. If you drop it, it will probably crack or break, but it's sturdy and well made. Flipping on the power lever, it starts up almost immediately ready for use. Much promoted auto sensor cleaning kicks in when powering up and down. As with most DSLRs, there's virtually no shutter lag and it focuses in a split second (especially when using a USM lens). In continuous shooting mode with a fast memory card, it can take 10 RAWs or 27 JPEGs at 3 frames per second. RAW images are 10 MB each, so get a speed 2 GB or larger memory card, such as SanDisk's Ultra II series. Replacing both 1.8" LCD and info display is 2.5" high resolution LCD with LED backlighting. It displays current camera settings, photos in memory, and menu. Thanks to greater real estate and more refined user interface, XTi is very intuitive and pleasure to use. The minus is 10% lower battery life, which was merely adequate to begin with. XTi has 95% crop 0.8x optical viewfinder that displays 9 auto focus points, shutter speed, aperture, and more, but misses ISO speed, white balance, and metering mode. Overall, XTi's viewfinder is more than adequate but pales to Nikon D80's larger and more comprehensive one. Highlights of software package are ImageBrowser (Mac OS X Universal Binary), ZoomBrowser (Windows), and Digital Photo Professional (Mac OS X Universal Binary and Windows). ImageBrowser and ZoomBrowser are easy-to-weight lightweight applications for managing JPEG and RAW. Digital Photo Professional is considerably more powerful and lets you use XTi's dust delete data feature for removing dust its sensor cleaning hardware couldn't remove 
I've considered other, higher priced digital SLRs, such as the Nikon D80 and Canon 30D. However, I decided that I probably won't be using some of the more advanced features offered by those cameras, and would rather spend the money saved on a better lens. In terms of picture quality, all these SLRs are capable of equivalent quality. Currently I have 3 lenses, the kit 18-55mm, the 50mm f/1.8, and the 85mm f/1.8. I don't use the kit zoom lens anymore because I favor the faster, prime lenses. I mostly take pictures of my children, and the 85mm f/1.8 is an excellent portrait lens. It is sharp, fast, and produces beautiful background blur. Zoom lenses unfortunately are not as sharp or fast, unless you're willing to pay much more than the cost of the camera body. I think all novice SLR owners should buy the cheap Canon 50mm f/1.8, to discover what a fast lens can do when you set the aperture to 1.8, and take some portraits. You too can have professional-looking results 
I took pictures with this camera with artificial light, natural light, and when it was almost dark and all of my images came out sharp. I'm only using the cheap 18-55mm lens, which does not have image stabilization. As long as I use a tripod, or brace against something to hold the camera still, the images are perfect. I shot landscapes, portraits, animals, moving traffic, the sky, the moon, and everything I could think of and it all came out right. I was going to buy a 5D, but so far I'm satisfied with this camera and the price is way lower. Now I wonder what my pictures would be like with an IS lens... hmmmm : 
I had this camera for about a week now. I bought an EF 28-105mm lens seperatly. I don't know why, but the auto focus did not work right away.It took some fiddling around before I was able to use the feature. I get gorgeous pictures with this camera. My one complaint is it feels small in the right hand. After 1/2 hour of shooting pictures my hand got a cramp. I have small hands and it still felt small to me. If you are considering this camera I'd go to a store see how it feels. I can't imaging being able to use it for a long time if you have a big hands. I'm still learning how to use it. But so far its meeting all my expectations. 
First of all I must say that this camera CAN take some wonderful, even incredible looking pictures. But since everyone else is proclaiming its virtues, I will write mainly about its negatives. There aren't too many, but it does have a few drawbacks; a couple of which I just don't understand. This camera is now the fourth digital camera I have bought. The first was the Nikon Coolpix 995 for my wife. The second was the Sony F707 for me. The third was the Canon SD400 for my wife. And lastly the XTi for me. So I have had a little experience with cameras at or near "prosumer" level. This is why I find it hard to believe how the XTi can get some of these things wrong. First of all is the white balance. Of my 4 cameras, this camera has, by far, the worst indoors Auto White Balance. I am using compact fluorescent light bulbs and daylight lights in the house and the XTi makes everything look yellow. And none of the other white balance options is close either. The one saving grace is the Custom White Balance option. You perform this Custom White Balance by taking a picture of something gray (preferably a large gray piece of paper or a card made just for this, and have it centered in the picture) and then selecting this picture as the Custom White Balance reference. After doing this the White Balance is nothing short of superb. I even had it work just by zooming in on something white and then selecting it as the reference picture. (I guess white works just as well as gray.) But my disappointment is, "Why does this have to be done at all?" All three other cameras of mine handle this lighting much better than the XTi. But what's really the saddest is that the Canon Elph handles it better than the XTi. It's nice that, after some hassle, it does have good white balance. But I shouldn't have to carry around a gray card everywhere I go or touch up every photo I take to get the right white balance. Especially when a 1 ï¿½ year old Canon does it better, for half the price. My next gripe is the lack of spot metering. It wouldn't bother me so much if: 1) The other metering options were more consistent. 2) Every other camera I own didn't have it. 3) Canon Tech Support hadn't told me that they reserve Spot Metering for their higher end cameras.....Especially when their own [...] has it!! How is a $500 camera higher end than the XTi? Usually I can select partial metering and then turn up the exposure about 1/3 to 2/3 of a stop and get decent exposure. But it would be much more consistent to just have a spot metering option; especially with backlit subjects, or with a lot of harsh, low sun and shade in the picture. My last gripe is about the included software, especially with RAW pictures. Don't even try loading this software on anything but a dual-core or 4 GHz PC. The software is ssslllooowww!!! For one thing, both the Zoombrowser EX and Digital Photo Professional start scanning the hard drive for pictures as soon as the software loads, and there doesn't seem to be any way to stop it. If you have a lot of pictures on your computer, it will take a long, long time before the software lets you do anything. Make sure you have coffee ready! The other thing is that the software is just a memory hog and runs excruciatingly slow; especially when trying to edit RAW or .cr2 files. Speaking of which, why does Canon have to use such a non-standard file? I would be glad to use some other software for editing my RAW's, but Canon's proprietary files can't be opened by other "normal" programs. So for now I'll just stick to .jpg's. Then there's the other complaints, which are true. The kit lens isn't very good. The form-factor could use work. ( I am constantly hitting the FEL button on accident) and the view finder is kind of smallish; among others. Overall I am pleased with the camera. I have some wonderful pictures already on the wall. But I've also had a few real stinkers due to the lack of spot metering and the occasional terrible white balance. If it weren't for these two (rather huge for me) issues, than I would give the XTi 5 stars. But until Canon fixes these glaring issues it won't be given my highest rating. And it also won't be recommended by me to anyone who's serious into photography.  
I can't help but give the lens cap 5 stars, what can I say, it fits, it covers the lens and keeps the dust out. The bad part about purchasing from this place was paying as much in postage as for the cap itself but it was hard to find elsewhere. I also could not have it delivered here on Fort Wainwright Alaska because I'm only allowed a PO Box so I had to have it shipped to my home in New York and then had them send it on to me-go figger 
I'm very happy with this lens. It offer's an ample variety of options, high image quality and it is light 
While this lens is a great improvement over the kit lenses the focus is often soft in raw modes and overal just not always tight. Color accuracy is very good, not perfect but very good. Of course color accuracy is more often a result of your paper (yes really - it is) than your lens after you get to a certain point. After using this lens for 2 months and shooting perhaps 20,000 shots with it I wished I had saved my money for the inevitable l series lens. If color accuracy is your main issue, be sure to look at your photo paper too. Hp, Kodak, and even low end papers from inkpress all do strang things to color and blur your images. Try someone like MOAB paper. You will be AMAZED at how much of a difference it will make in your color accuracy and detail. I just switched to Kokapelli from MOAB for commercial prints and am amazed by the results. As is usually the case focus is softest at f3.5 though it does produce a surprisingly decent bokeh 
I bought this lens to replace the kit lens on the Rebel XT. I find this lens to be a very good value, a very good value. I also have the canon 28-135 3.5 ... And find the 28-105 lens to be a very stong lens for the price. It might even be just a notch clearer then the 28-135 but at half the price. It's size is nice and light weight and fits nice on the Rebel since it is a smaller DSLR. All in all, a great lens at a budet price but it dosn't act like it. Fast focus, fair range, nice size, easy to lug around. I would sugest this lens to any one and first on my list to someone who is not wanting to go crazy on lenses and extras for their camera, and just want to simply get some nice pics without spending all their lunch money. Also the lens takes the same size filters as the kit lens, so if you have spent a few dollers on a few filters for the kit lens your in luck. I know I was happy to still use the 3 filters I've already got. 
This lens is truly a 'must have' if you don't have lots of cash to spend. Simply put, it is an excellent performer for the money. I recently got this lens for my Rebel XT, and noticed a HUGE improvement over the 18-55mm kit lens. Sharpness has improved considerably. The 18-55mm has some SERIOUS issues in that area. First of all, sharpness was REALLY bad at large apertures. But smaller apertures were not really much better. The 28-105mm still is not the best performer at large apertures. But it is MUCH better than the 18-55mm. However, at around f8 or higher, the 28-105mm is tack sharp. In addition, this lens does not suffer from the problem of having a clear foreground and soft background that my 18-55mm suffers from. Color accuracy has also GREATLY improved with the 28-105mm. Colors look MUCH more natural with this lens than with the 18-55mm lens. This is particularly true of lighter colors, especially when you go to increase saturation with Photoshop (or other software). Increasing saturation to improve the appearance of dark colors on a picture taken with the 18-55mm would typically make lighter colored objects look VERY unnatural. This sort of problem is MUCH reduced with the 28-105mm. I should also say that this lens appears to overexpose somewhat compared with the 18-55mm. This is more good than bad, however, as it has the effect of making the lens faster. Of course, this lens is not without its drawbacks. I mentioned the slight softness at large apertures, for instance. Also, it is not the fastest lens out there. But then again, what do you expect for the price? And finally, 28mm is not exactly wide angle on a cropped sensor digital SLR like the Rebels or the 20D. But despite these drawbacks, this lens really performs like a champ. And when used in its element (ie higher f-numbers), it works quite well. Also, since it is not an EF-S lens, it will not become a paperweight should you decide to upgrade to a 5D. 
THE BOTTOM LINE: I needed to replace the lens on my Canon Rebel XT D-SLR. The EF-S on first glance seemed like the perfect replacement since Canon produced the EF-S series specifically for the compressed sensor D-SLR line. After weighing the pros and cons of the two, I chose this EF lens largely on the basis of price. It was the right choice, and I haven't found any loss of features or quality. Multiplying the range by 1.6 for a 35mm equivalence (if you have a Rebel XT, 20D or 30D), this model is really just a slightly wide angle to stronger telephoto zoom. (about 45mm-170mm if it was a 35mm film camera) If this range suits you, then this lens is an excellent value over a EF-S wide-angle/telephoto zoom. You'll keep all of the features, save money and have a faster lens. The EF series meshes well with the current line of Canon digital SLRs. In addition, unlike the EF-S series, they are compatible with all of the Canon EOS products including higher-end cameras like the Mark II. SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS FROM WEEKS OF USE: My first concern before purchasing this lens was the MINIMUM FOCUS DISTANCE of 0.5 meters, or approximately 18 inches. I do a lot of macro work transferring images into digital, so I was a tad worried. However, after getting the lens and zooming in, I realized that the focusing distance wasn't really an issue after all. In most cases, I could manage to stand six or so inches further away and still get a highly magnified shot. So that you can see that the macro function works well, I've uploaded an image of a small hamster photographed at 102mm. (The aperature is pretty big -- after all, a hamster IS a moving target) My second concern was lens QUALITY AND SHARPNESS, particularly in the wide-angle setting near the edges of the photo. This lens exceeded my expectations. So that you can see the quality of this lens, I've uploaded an uncropped picture of the SF Bay Bridge taken at the 28mm wide-angle setting. You'll see that the photo is sharp all the way through the edges of the frame. (it is a web-sized jpeg, so you should take that into consideration and use it mainly to see the sharpness of the photo, particularly near the outside edges) I did get an unexpected bonus with this lens. The MANUAL FOCUS ring is in the front. I love it. Disabling the auto-focus is a snap, and the position and feel of the manual focus is perfect for sports or social activities where the subject is often not the closest object. The ring itself is ridged and made of rubber, making handling a breeze. While I hadn't expected to replace my stock lens so soon, I think it ended up for the best. This lens is actually superior to the one that came with the XT. I lost some wide-angle function but gained much more telephoto. The price is excellent and the quality of the lens is high. 
For the price and quality I rated this lenses with 5 stars. If you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos I took in Europe. I too around 5000 photos. I posted a few on the web (See link below). For the price I recommend this lens as walk around lens. The zoom is pretty usefull They are very realiable and (almost) very sharp. Get this lens instead of the kit lens (18-55 mm) until you are ready to spend more. Here are some of my pictures taken in Europe with this lens (Images have been compressed): http://www.laplazita.net/europa/ 
I was given this lens after my Sigma 28-135mm lens broke. While that lens has been fixed, I haven't used it since attatching the Canon lens on my camera. The Canon 28-105mm may have a smaller zoom range, but other than that is clearly a superior lens in every respect. It's sturdy, fast-focusing, sharp, and has good color. In short, it's what you hope to find when purchasing a consumer grade lens. There are other cheaper lenses on the market, like Sigma's lens or Canon's f/4-5.6, but this lens is worth the extra $100 for its reliability, sharpness and overall usability 
Ok to start off I've heard different opinions about camera sensor blowers..some say it works like magic some say it can make it worse. So I gambled and bought this Giotto blower. I didn't want to buy all the cleaning swabs, liquid ect and rub it off...seemed like a annoying project. So I gave this blower a try. I never had that much dust on my sensor but when made my aperture smaller f/22 to be exact and did a picture of the blue sky I noticed a few blobs or dust spots. I wanted them off...now heres where the blower comes in. I used it a total of 3 times and it removed 98% of the dust off my sensor..thats really really good in my book for a $9 device. Now I have like 2 tiny dust spots on my sensor and I can easily live with that..or I could try to use it a few more times to completely get it off... In the meantime I'm very happy with the dust I got off it. Buy this blower....its a no brainer. 
I had some dust spots on my lenses, and on the mirrors inside. I was afraid to use the brush or cloth kits, since they could easily scratch. One of my photography books suggested I use this exact air blower, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's a simple tool, but it emits a strong amount of air and I was able to clean everything off. Even works well for keyboards or other dusty spots 
It works great - and no touching the sensor with a brush. Great produc 
I was surprised at just how big this rubber blower is. For it's size, it doesn't blow much air out - maybe a little bit more than a rubber squeeze toy for dogs. Speaking of dog toys, this item squeaks everytime I squeeze the bulb. The bottom line is this item actually works and helps remove dust from your sensor. Because of that, it's a solid pick-up.. 
I was quite annoyed when I found my D70 had come out of the box with dust on the lens. The place I bought it would only send it away to Nikon for cleaning, but a friend with the same camera advised me to get a dust blower and showed me how I should be able to blow the dust off myself. the first blower I tried didn't have enough power and the dust remained. I had almost decided to take the camera to get it cleaned when I read a review that suggested this one. I took a chance, and after about 15 minutes of trying, checking, and trying again, I finally have a dust free sensor! this is the most valuable piece of equipment that I have purchased for my camera, and I recommend this to anyone with a similar problem 
I had originally bought another brand of blower to clean my digital camera, but after using it once I ended up introducing more dirt and/or rubber bits than I care to remember. Long story short I don't use that for my camera anymore and it took me a long time to get all of that crud out of my camera. But then I decided to give another brand a try since so many people seemed to be able to use blower bulbs without any problems. When I got my new blower my sensor was already fairly clean, but after using it it was a little cleaner. You will still sometimes have those stuck on particles (I use sterile pec pads and eclipse solution to get rid of those with pretty good results, but do this at your own risk since it voids most camera manufacturers warranties.) I also keep my blower in the original packaging to keep it as clean as possible, I guess I am a little gun shy after my first experience 
I have owned the Giottos Rocket Air Blaster for 2 weeks now and love it. I use it for blowing dust of everything: Camera lenses, computer screens and out of computer keyboards. It is made of a nice soft material that allows it to be stored flat and out of the way. Additionally, it creates sufficient pressure to force away most dust particles and of course requires no canned air, as it works as you pump it. I'll never by a can of forced air again 
I bought this gizmo to clear the CMOS detector in my digital SLR camera. It seemed like a good alternative to using a specialized, expensive sensor wipes, and it would not invalidate the camera's warranty. The results with my camera were good but not perfect. Many large particles of dust were blown off the detector. However, some medium-sized particles were merely pushed to the edges. Nonetheless, I really like having the air blaster just for my camera. Aside from my camera, I have used this on a number of other devices around my home and office. It works particularly well at clearing dust out of the vents in my laptop and underneath the keys on my laptop's keyboard. However, it works poorly in clearing out the dust and grime in my desktop keyboard. In summary, I would say that this is a good device for owners of digital SLR cameras, although it is not a perfect substitute for sensor wipes. For owners of electronic equipment in general, this is a clever device that works reasonably well at cleaning dust out of some places 
One of the problems with owning a digital camera is that you'll occasionally have to clean dust off of the image sensor. You can't use compressed air because it will freeze and destroy your sensor. You don't really want to blow either because the moisture in your breath will damage your sensor... and make you pass out. You need "dry", relatively-high pressure air and this is what the Rocket Air is outstanding for. Simple to use. 1-Remove your lens (on SLR), 2-put into cleaning mode, 3-hang the camera upside down (presumably, to allow dust to fall out), and 4-squeeze the Rocket Air thereby cleaning the camera. At this point, I swear by it. I'm constantly changing lenses and this helps remove spects and ghost images. It's a must have in your Camera Kit 
The best feature of this flash is the wireless E-TTL feature. With two 550ex's one will work as a master and one as a slave and with the ST-E2 both flashes can be off camera and fired E-TTL. The draw backs are: price, no manual control in slave mode for greater light control, and size (this thing is big). The plus side weighs out the negatives. It is a great flash 
I am very happy of having gotten this flash.. it works pretty well, and I like its performance 
This is an absolute do-everything flash, with master/slave operation, wireless control of multiple channels for slave flashes, A:B:C lighting ratio control (better than the ST-E2's mere A:B ratio), full manual or automatic operation, strobe effects at selectable Herz rates and power, and even a small panel that serves either to widen its flash coverage to 17mm or simply provide a catchlight in a model's eyes when using bounce flash. Range is excellent, battery life is very good and can be compounded with one of the battery packs. The light itself provides excellent color, and a red lamp near the base adds a much more accurate and less harsh focus assist lamp than most of Canon's cameras provide. If you have an SLR, you'll almost certainly want an external flash. You can provide fill flash to reduce shadows in subjects eyes etc. during harsh daylight shots, take the flash off the camera to eliminate nasty shadows, and avoid the shadows caused by larger lenses and onboard flashes. Minor quibbles: most DSLRs have crop ratios of 1.3x or 1.6x, but don't pass this information on to the 550EX, which wouldn't care anyway. This means the flash thinks you want greater coverage than you really need (i.e. it will give you a 50mm's angle of flash coverage, when you only need an 80mm's), so you waste a lot of flash power and don't get optimum recycling times. Also, the interface is a little non-intuitive. If you want a slave- or onboard-only flash and don't need all the extra features, the considerably cheaper 420EX is for you. That said, if you do want all the extra features, the 550EX is still not for you. You want the 580EX, slated for October 2004 release, which fixes the minor issues with the 550 
Top of the line. Works as advertised. TTL, E-TTL. 4 double AA batteries. Tilt, Rotate head, soft lens built in. Can control slave flash 
This camera is a steal. The reviews on amazon helped me decide on this camera and sure it is worth it. 
This camera is the first digital for me, and the only camera I have ever enjoyed having. The macro setting gives amazing closeups of bugs, flowers, etc. With the purchase of a charger and some batteries, I've kept it going for almost nothing. Better get a big memory card, too. The silly settings like "color swap" and "fireworks" are fun to play with. My only complaint is it is slow to recover between shots, so you miss some action of kids, etc. For the price, it can't be beat. gramma t 
The camera is the perfect solution for someone who does not want exchangable lensesand some items for more professional results. Combined with a direct photo printer it is easy and fun with plenty of photo options on the dial. My only problem is that I did not receive with the camera the software to alllow me to download to the computer from the from the Memory chip itself. Is there any way to get this software 
After hearing that Consumer Reports gave the Canon A520 a BEST BUY rating, I decided this must be a good family of cameras. It has been a joy to own and use. Easy to take pictures, easy to work and yes, it takes great pictures. It has more bells on it than I will ever use. I have been very satisfied with 4 and 5 MP cameras and have not wanted to spend a fortune for more. I just need to take pictures, review them and easily download to my computer. This does that and much, much more 
Very quick delivery. Product was exactly as advertised. Very happy with the whole process and the product 
I am very happy with the product, it is very very good, the only thing was that it does not bring the multiple pictures leaving the button pressed, but the image quality is outstanding! 
I got this as much for safety as anything. If I should drop my lens, a solid lens hood will help. Plastic construction will absorb some of the impact without transmitting all of it, as a metal hood would. Hopefully it will eliminate occurances of flair, although with the Canon 50mm f1.4 lens, that's not a big issue to begin with. It also can keep dust and debris off the lens surface if you're shooting in a less-than-ideal environment. It twists on and off the lens easily. When it's on, it's very snug and secure. Kind of pricy for a piece of plastic, but Canon's in business to make money. 
I never take my UV filter off of my lens unless I am going to immediately put on a different filter. There are basically two camps out there, those that feel you should always use a UV filter to protect your lens from dirt and scratches and those that feel it is a waste of time and only degrades your image. Well, I tried going without one for awhile and then dirt started to build up on the front element of my very expense lens. And although you can clean the front element of a lens, I feel much, much safer wiping my comparatively cheap UV filter time and time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage. I think for the nearly unquantifiable loss in image quality you may suffer by having a UV filter on, it is well worth the extra piece of mind it gives me 
I bought this camera 12/2005 for Christmas on the recommendation of Wolf Camera. I am not a photographer or techno advanced; just a mom with 4 kids. I love this camera. It's great and hasn't failed me yet. The salesman told me about the oversaturation and I adjusted it. The battery life is amazing as I am always on the go. It is so small I just throw it in my purse. I have not had any problems with the lens sticking or turning on unless I turn it on. Sounds like some of the other reviewers should go with a digital SLR. This is an awesome point and shoot camera and I would recommend it to anyone 
PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS CAMERA'S SHOCK SENSITIVITY I was pretty happy with this all-in-one compact camera until it had to be repaired for the SECOND time. It's sensitivity to vibration or a slight bump while the lens is out is way too sensitive for the real world. The result is it loses it's ability to focus and zoom. It didn't help that it commonly powered on while in a pocket, with the lens protruding, thereby causing unintentional harm to the lens assembly. The first time it happened Casio repaired it under warranty. The second time it was outside of warranty and the repair center wanted $137 to repair it - that's more than 1/3 the original purchase price. I won't reinvest in a weak product. I'd rather put that money into a new camera altogether 
The EXZ750 is simply a fantastic compact camera. It takes great pictures, even greater if you bother to use one of the many picture presets (scenery, portrait, macro, etc.). The pros: - picture quality is great; if you want anything better you'll probably be lugging around a DSLR - picture presets are extremely easy to use, even if you are not a techie and / or you've never handled a camera in your life (is there such a person?). - it will fit into your pocket and you'll forget it is there. This is a major advantage as the best camera is the camera you actually have with you - this one you will. - common settings (picture size, ISO, etc.) are one or two clicks away - very convenient The cons: - the camera does take videos (at more than decent resolution) but they come out shaky even if you have pretty steady hands. Without some image stabilization in it, it is definitely not a replacement for a video camera - although the camera has ISO settings of 200 and 400 you should probably avoid them due to noise Overall, a very positive and pleasing experience. Even having a digital SLR, I'm never giving this little puppy up 
Very small size (fits in my baggy jean pocket), fast startup, fast response when shooting picture. Much easier to carry around than my Canon G3. Does not do well indoors when flash is needed. Lots of red eye, much more than my Canon G3 
I spent a weekend researching digital cameras, exhausting and confusing, so many to choose from, and when I was in a store looking at various cameras, a customer just started telling me how much he loved this camera he had just bought, which was this one; I assumed it was 'a sign'. And it was. Small size is fantastic, put in your shirt pocket or purse, almost weightless. Quick shutter takes the best pictures of new baby grandchild of any camera anyone in the family has used. (others had Sony and Canon digital cameras) The movies are excellent. The quality and color of images are perfect, not too over-digitized as some have said. Everyone in the family thinks I'm a wonderful photographer, but it's not me, it's this camera. The battery life is really long, and it can take good pictures in multiple types of poor visibility situations. In the first month, I dropped it a few times, once on the sidewalk and it survived which was impressive. Having a viewfinder is a big advantage in bright sunlight. After using and loving it for 9 months, the telephoto froze. I sent it back to Casio, and they fixed it; it took 3-4 weeks, which is a little long, but did not charge me for the repair. The baby pictures are fantastic, especially because it takes the picture so fast, and the scenery pics all look like National Geographic. 
This lens is my favorite as I keep it on my Rebel XT at all times. I enjoy taking macro close-ups and portrait-type shots, which makes this a great lens for everyday use. It is light-weight and not bulky. My last SLR camera (years ago) was a Minolta with 50mm f/1.8 lens, and various other lenses that I rarely used. I usually don't use a zoom lens due to the extra length and weight. Also, most non-professional zoom lenses are much slower at the closest tele-position due to the higher f/stop. With a fixed focal length of 60mm, I don't mind moving myself toward or away from the subject (not a big deal). The pictures always appear to be sharp with good contrast and color saturation. My opinion on this lens is: "buy it ... you'll like it". I did ... and I love it. Good Luck 
the optics are the best i've ever seen. the clarity is great. the abillity to focus on small objects only 2" away allows great macro pictures. however the auto focus is much slower than most canon lenses, but i can focus manually. this is my favotite lens ever 
This lens is top notch. The quality of the photographs is the best I have ever experienced with a camera. 
If you would like a list of sites with reviews email gumby at dontquotemeonthat dot com Pros: Very sharp, bright (fast), versatile, excellent build quality. Cons: AF tends to be dicy in low-light conditions. Pros: SHARP, SHARP, SHARP. No distortion, no CA, optically superb and better Cons: EF-S mount. Had to sell it when I upgraded to the 5D. Pros: Very solid build, Internal focusing is fantastic, Produces wonderfully saturated photos and high in contrast, Bokeh is lovely and very smooth, Auto Focus is typical ring-USM with Full Time Manual focus being excellent and smooth. f2.8 Aperture, 52mm Filter Size Cons: I do feel Canon could reduce the price, however for this quality I don't mind paying for it. if your a newbie here's some info A lens is "fast" when it has a low f-stop... ok so when you have a smaller number the apature is bigger which allows more light through, so this means you can up the shutter speed. and still have enough light reach the sensor. ok so lets say you have an out door shot if you have say an f/4 lens the shutter speed could be 1/250 of a second and you would get a good exposer. Now this lens can only go f/4 but if you in the same outdoor setting, had an f/2.8 lens you could jump to 1/500 of a second and get the same exposer. and freeze the action mmore effectivly, this i believe is why it's a "fast" lens. ok have fun and get it done 
4 starts because otherwise 5 stars is inevitable: 1) Slow autofocus (hunt at times) but is to be expected of a macro lens. 2) built quality not as solid as expected at this price range. I bought this lens instead for two purpose: Macro and Portrait! I was thinking of buying the 100mm macro plus 85mm f1.8 but this lens saves me buying two lenses! I have been very happy with it as what it is. I don't do flying insects very much so it is not a problem but that said I was able to get 1:1 shot of a fly, see sample here: http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_54.html There are other samples in this gallery here: http://www.theteh.com/html/my_3rd_350d_xt.html The large aperture (F2.8) means that one could have shallow DOF and great for low light such as this pic: http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_49.html For portrait, I accidentally took this photo during the London Bombing of a women 'Shocked' by the incident unfolding in the public TV display. It was a coincident that her background inmage was the winning Reuter's photo of Tsunami tragedy and the matching colour of their dresses! I was quite far away so was able to capture her from head to toe: http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_25.html This illustrate the capability of both macro and normal photography using this lens. You will not regret it unless your primary aim is to shoot flying insets where longer 100mm or 150mm macro lenses may be needed in this case. 
I only wish that I had bought this lens earlier so I could have been using it longer. I am especially pleased with the short minimum focus distance - about 3 inches. This allows you to get very close to a small subject and to still fill the frame with the subject. I have had no problems with this lens and I love it 
The new Canon EF-S 60mm f2.8 Macro USM Digital SLR lens is designed to cover the entire field of the digital imaging sensors in Canon's digital SLR line, most notably the Canon EOS 20D. This corresponds in film to a normal lens perspective of approximately a 50mm lens. Furthermore it benefits from having Canon's USM autofocusing technology, allowing the photograher to have rapid, almost silent, autofocus, which is important when working in the field (You don't want to distract the animal you are photographing with the sound of the lens being focused.). Although this lens is not a L Series lens, the quality of its construction comes close to Canon's premium L Series professional line of lenses. Indeed, I have read elsewhere an excellent test report (I believe at Erwin Puts's website) on this lens praising its optical performance. Any Canon user of digital SLRs such as the EOS 20D who is interested in macro photography will regard this lens as absolutely essential for making great macro images 
This lens is well worth the price. The first thing you will notice is the quality when you handle the lens. It has a very solid construction. But once you mount the lens is where it REALLY shines. The clarity of focus is the best I've seen and the focus is super fast. The macro functionality is just awesome. I highly recommend this lens 
Love this battery. Long lasting and just as good as the name brand 
Works as great as orignal battery. You will never know the difference except that is a lot cheaper! 
This battery works in my Canon SD550 interchangeably with the Canon NB3L that came with it. I get about as many shots on either one. 
I've had this battery for 3 months. So I don't have long term experience. But so far it's been excellent. No better or worse then the original canon battery. I would reccomend it to anyone. 
I have a Canon SD-550. This battery is works perfect with it. I've noticed no difference in charge time and usage when compare with the original manufacterer one. Except the price is a lot lower 
What can I say? It fits in place of the overpriced Canon NB3L battery for my SD500 and lasts longer than the OEM battery. The quality of the battery on the external is very good. No sloppy glued edges or ill-fitting parts. The battery works very well in the camera and lasts longer by one hundred or so shots. I use a gig card so I tend to shot alot at once. Even with the flash the battery life is comparable to the Canon or even longer. I bought two instead of a single Canon battery and I have not been dissappointed 
I bought this battery as an extra battery for my camera. It is a lot lower in price than the Canon battery. I have not used either my original or this extra battery enough to fully compare them, but they seem to work equally well so far 
The product was great! You should get it. Usually, I'm skeptical abour getting generic brands, but this works perfectly 
This replacement battery is half the cost of Canon's yet offers longer life. I bought it when I first got my SD10. When one battery runs out, the spare goes in. The Lenmar still works great while the Canon is near end life! I am buying two more since they are so cheap! DO NOT buy no name batteries on ebay. They do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money! Don't do it.. 
I purchased my 300D in May 2005, when the XT was released and this 6.3 MP model's price began falling. I'd have to really pick this camera apart to tell you the downsides of it; disregard reviews by those who think this camera is not up to par -- of course it's not comparable to the EOS 1-Series or a 5D, so don't expect the same features or capabilities. The right user, however, can get similar results. That said, unless you are a professional photographer, I cannot imagine how the Digital Rebel could be inadequate for any amateur or semi-pro shooter. It's speed and megapixels have since been passed by, but it's still, especially now, a great buy. The kit lens will perform for you just fine, although most of my shots with the kit lens are at 18mm, landscape or just wide-angle shots. The flash works very well in most situations, even in extremely dark rooms. One guy complained his AF hunted in low light situations, even with flash...of course, what do you expect in a dark room? Use manual focus and grow up. Quality is great from ISO 100-400, although 800 can be somewhat ugly at times, and 1600 is basically unusable, especially if you're not shooting at f/2.8 or bigger. My main complaints: slow start-up time compared to the newer models (XT, 20D, etc) ... camera seems to be out of breath after continuous shooting; take 8 shots quickly and you may notice the camera needs to process info before it can shoot again. 2.5 frames/second is not very fast if you're shooting any sports. Overall, this camera has been incredibly reliable for me; it's gotten me front page shots on newspapers, magazine covers, calendars and websites. I used it so much that I blew out the shutter in 10 months; Canon fixed it at no charge and it works fine since. One minor problem: very rarely, it won't turn on unless I remove the battery and re-insert it. I've found the battery life to be fantastic. I can use it all day, even with flash, and still have some life at the end of the day. A backup battery in your bag should give you more than enough insurance for a day. I've printed at 11x17 with excellent results. With some practice, it's very easy to navigate. Menus and options are simple; changing the ISO or aperture is very easy despite what some have complained about. It's very reliable in fully-auto mode as well, especially if you're shooting with flash. A memory card reader is a must when uploading images. Overall: it's old news in the world of digital SLRs, but right now, a new or used model at such a good price is really is great value 
I have had this camera a little over a year and I still can't put it down. It is wonderful. I have two little boys on the move and this camera takes their picture with hardly any delay. Just snap and go. I bought my dad the XP in March and he loves it too. 
An incredible piece of equipment at an almost give away price. I have no complaints and this camera surpasses what I expected 
I had an Olympus 5MP point-n-shoot Camedia camera I was pretty happy with for portraits. I was annoyed w/ the fixed lens that prevented me from taking good photos of wildlife. I have hummingbird feeders in my backyard and unless you've had the opportunity to work with hummingbird families for years, the sweet, tiny animals are skittish and don't often pose for you when you get too close. When my point-n-shoot stopped focusing, I took advantage of this situation by rationalizing this bigger purchase. What a joy it has been to use this camera. The 6.3MP is a significant improvement over 5 and the ability to take photos in manual mode cannot be understated. With the fixed point-n-shoot, the camera refused to shoot if it didn't "feel" that it was in focus... so it was impossible to shoot sunsets, lightning or other natural beauties in the "infinity" range of the focal length. The Rebel makes use of Compact Flash - the oldest, yet still the best technology for taking fast, high-quality photos in digital cameras. My less than perfect rating is due to the small memory buffer. You can take up to 3fps very easily, but if you click-click-click the shutter, it doesn't matter if Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster and Elvis start doing a little soft-shoe right in front of you, by the time the Rebel finishes writing the recent 3 quick shots to the CF card, the shot of the century has already slithered back into the swamp by the time the camera is ready to be used again. If you're taking portraits, not a problem. A click here and there and you'll never notice the lack of memory buffer... but if you're shooting at a ball game or other quick moving objects, you're going to get frustrated very quickly. The flash is decent, but you really need a good flash like the 580 in the hot-shoe if you want a better even spread and avoidance of red-eye. A lot of folks shrug about red-eye since most affordable or free programs like iPhoto or Photoshop Elements have built-in correction for red-eye - but red-eye correction by one click is only available for humans. If you're shooting wildlife, forget about any software that has a one-click (or a million clicks!) solution for blue-eye in dogs, yellow-eye in cats, flaming-demon eye in bunnies or the variety of odd reflections you will get bouncing off retinas of various species. The best way to circumvent this problem is to avoid bouncing flash directly into the retinas of your subjects from the get-go. No more glare or odd reflections when you use a better flash. The ability to upgrade to better lenses is the crux of SLR ownership. The sky is the limit. Get a good wide-angle and a good, fast telephoto and you've got yourself set for some great shots. This camera isn't going to take advantage of CF cards faster than 40x, so you can save money by buying the slightly slower CF cards, but I invested in the 80x cards so I can use them when I upgrade cameras. This Rebel has gotten me back into photography after a decade-long hiatus. The camera automatically detects vertical shots and turns them 90 degrees for you in the LCD window. It is quick and easy to adjust the ISO to "push" the film (so to speak) to take advantage of low-light situations, but you get the same grainy effects as you do when you push real film. With an ISO of 100 and using a 512MB CF card, you have 157 photos at your disposal - if you push it all the way to 1600, 104 shots on the same card. At 400, your shots are already compromized regarding print quality... but if Sasquatch comes-a-knockin' in the wee hours, you'll still get decent proof if you shoot at 1600. Having a background in film photography spanning 2 decades, I didn't even have to consult the manual for this camera to use it fresh out of the box. It handles in many ways like a professional film SLR, and unlike the point-n-shoots, there aren't cryptic settings that have no film parallel. For sunny days and outdoor shots, this camera is a sheer joy to use 
I have owned a Canon EOS Digital Rebel 6.3mp for several weeks now and love it. Fantastic pictures features. I worked with SLR's for many years. Figured it was time to "move up" to the digital SLR and glad I did. This camera has plenty of features available, or you can just set it for "auto" and that works fine, too. Though an optional flash is not needed for most photography I wanted one for far shots and such. Canon makes several models dedicated to this camera, but I find them weak (220EX) or costly. Shop carefully in trying to find a compatible flash. It needs to be "dedicated" to the digital Rebels. One that will work with AF (auto focus) or the SLR (film) Rebel may not work right. I also received conflicting information from Ritz Camera, both on-line and in the stores. Bottom line, if you need a flash, shop carefully and ask all the right questions. Personally I have held off buying one hoping more models at a lower price come out. The camera does already have a small pop-up flash. BTW, the Tamron AF 70-300 Macro 1:2 zoom is a nice lens to buy with it, and priced nicely at Beach Camera 
This review will be really two parts: one for the amateur who has been using point and shoots, or has experience with film based SLRs; the other one for the prosumer or advanced amateur who is either going to digital from film Canon EOS bodies or is getting into pro-level digital shooting on the low end. For the former, the camera is pretty much all you need; for the latter, it is lacking key functionality, but IS workable. I'm in the latter category. I've done freelance photo work in the past, but not since the digital age began to take off in the late '90s. I've been shooting EOS cameras since the early '90s, and added medium format in the late '90s for wedding and portrait work. I'll be honest: I didn't like the idea of digital at first. Sure, the workflow improvements over film sounded great, but I wasn't seeing the quality of digital vs. film. I still am very much a believer that, at least for prints, especially big prints, film delivers a better overall picture quality. But the quality of digital SLRs since the release of the Digital Rebel is so good, the workflow advantages trump film in all but rare situations. I'll still use my medium format equipment for landscape and outdoor pics I'll print large and frame, but other than a pocket 35mm, I can't see using film much at all in that category, after seeing what I can do with the DReb. If you are primarily an amateur who is either used to using a Point and Shoot (film or digital) or who has used a consumer film SLR, you'll find this camera easy to operate and use to the extent you used your other cameras. I bought this without the lens, as I have other lenses and the packaged one didn't offer me anything, but for those without Canon glass, you get a surprisingly good lens with the kit. Remember, though, that the lens will only fit on the Digital Rebel, its successors, and possibly the 10/20D line of Canon EOS bodies. Shooting is pretty simple. Charge the battery, which is easy -- the charger blinks depending upon its charge. You can look at the charger with the battery on there and see where you are, charge wise. It doesn't take very long to charge the battery fully. Once you have the battery in the camera, you'll need a Compact Flash card. I recommend SanDisk Ultra II cards. You won't experience any write time problems over an above this camera's natural limitations. Then, set the ISO value (100-1600), set either the pre-programed mode on one side of the dial, or the traditional Program/Shutter Priority/Apeture Priority settings on the other side, and you are ready to rock. Remember that unlike many digital cameras, the LED on the back of the camers DOES NOT function as a viewfinder. Aside from displaying various camera options, it shows what you shot after shooting. If you want to use this as an advanced amateur/pro setup, you can, but know its limitations. I bought this in March and have been shooting all sports with it. I'm using a Canon L USM lens, and have gotten some terrific shots. But I've also missed some that have led me to decide to sell this camera and pick up a 20D. The problem I get into is focusing speed and zones. The 2.5 fps with only a 4 frame burst isn't as big a problem as it sounds. I can still get good action in the burst mode, but admittedly 5 fps with 22 or 25 (20D) bursts is much better. If you want to use this to shoot something like concerts or indoor events, you won't have the same focusing issues. You will have to deal with any flash limitations, but for that information, you will have to read another review. I'm not a camera flash guy under any definition. The only real problem I've had with this camera is that my shots are consistently underexposed by about .5-.7 of a stop. I shoot exclusively RAW mode (never shot JPG on this one other than first dozen or so shots) and it has been correctable when I convert the images. This is more of a minor irritation, and may not be noticable in JPEG shots. I've seen others using this camera complain of it as well. This camera is as good of a consumer camera as you will find. If a pro, or semi-pro, can make something function for his or her needs, you know the consumer can get everything they need out of this. I've been shooting since I was 8 or so, have owned umpteen cameras, and this one fills its market niche as good as any of them 
I have had 5 digital point and shoot cameras all a little bigger and better than the last. This is my first SLR and I am not in the least disappointed. This camera meets or exceeded everything I expected from it. Very easy to learn, read the manual and use the web site tuturial and when the battery is charged your ready to go take pictures. I highly recommend this camera 
I purchased a D-30 from Amazon last year and I previously had been using a Digital Nikon. The improvement was monumental in all aspects. I subsequently drowned my camera, and I am getting ready to repurchase another D30. They are not ready for water yet? I have taken approximately 5000 pictures and saved them all in the most usable format and I will continue to do the same. The Photoshop software that comes with the camera is very user friendly, I am sure there are many features yet to learn, but I have been extremely happy with what I have already used. I hesitate to say mastered 
I recently moved into the prosumer level of digital. The Canon D30 has proven to be an awesome camera. There maybe better (D60), but if you are serious about digital, the D30 has to be one of the best cameras for the price. There is a slight lag between shots, but if you are not photographing speeding bullets and express trains, the time between shots is hardly a distraction 
I've owned one of these cameras for about four years now, and I have been very pleased with it. It is light, small and easy to carry. It takes beautiful pictures--very sharp, and with good colors. The pictures look good even when you blow them up so big you can see the individual pixels. It was actually my second camera like this. The first had a problem with the USB port on the side of the camera, and I took it back to the store and traded it for a new one. This camera also had a problem too, after about two years, the button on the back that is needed for making settings stopped working properly. But still, considering the cost of the camera and the quality of the pictures, I will be buying another one. It's worth it. 
This camera is great for photographing artwork. It's the only camera I could find that doesn't bow the edges of paintings or watercolors (I think a lot of cameras have a lens that distors things, but you can't tell until you photograph something that is supposed to be rectangular). The color reproduction is also good. If you want a camera that takes good pictures of distant objects, or one with higher than 2mp resolution, look for another camera. 
This camera is designed to be an entry-level snapshot camera and it is very good at being just that. It takes decent photos and is very easy to use. As other reviewers have indicated, it does tend to chew through the batteries, but I just buy AAs cheap at Sam's and don't worry about it. It works especially well in outdoor situtions. It performs less well in low light. Due to this limitation, it is just about useless as a webcam. Even with all the lights on in the room, the webcam image is almost totally black. The flash and the lens are less than an inch apart, so this camera is very prone to redeye. There is a redeye reduction mode to the flash that works okay, but doesn't totally fix the problem. All-in-all, for an entry-level camera, the A200 is quite usable. Just be aware of what it is and don't expect it to do more. 
I had and tried several digit-cams and can say that you cannot find a better camera for this price. Pros: + Great value, low price + Easy handling + Portability, light weight + Great Fuji colours, good auto white balance + Fast shutter response, close to film cameras + Control over exposure, flash and pre-programmed white balance + It uses AA's, great battery life + Changig between images in playback mode doesn't take hours + Excellent prints from the photos Cons: - Images noisier than competition (but they are more expensive also) - Images too much compressed, therefore less detail, no control over jpeg compression (but this is the same with most Fuji models unfortunately) - No control over ISO - Low resolution LCD, too dark in low-light - No optical zoom (but at this price it's ok) - The camera has a cheap feel to it (but again, at this price it's ok) - Weak flash for outdoor night shots, but enough for smaller room shots - Flash recharge time takes a few seconds, camera freezes (but this is the same with most Fuji models unfortunately) - It uses expensive XD-cards - Sluggish zooming and panning in playback mode - No sound in video I highly recommend this camera for beginners or to those who doesn't want to spend more on a digital camera. I've read many negative reviews due to it's bad photo indoors. Okay, it's not a Canon G3. At first I thought the same, but then set the controls to manual, set the exposure up to the highest value and then shot the picture. The end result was much better than in full auto mode. So my advice is indoors and in low-light set the exposure manually, you'll be glad you did I promise. The colours are well balanced, and the prints come out great, no matter how noisy the images are, you won't notice that on the photo paper. This model is now out of sale, but if you can find a second-hand one at a good price don't be afraid to buy it, it's an excellent buy 
Wow is all there is to say no problems with it perfect for a casual picture take 
This is a very nice starter camera that is easy to use. The batteries run out kind of fast, but once I bought rechargeable batteries it solved that problem! Surprising good quality for the small amount of money I paid for it 
Pros: Excellent picture quality, great zoom, nice panoramic feature, SD card, great video and sound quality for a picture camera, the best that you can by for this money and the LCD can rotate in any angle. Cons: Flash does not pop up automatically; just 16mb SD card in the box. PD: this camera size is not a pocket one but the size is good enough to shoot with one hand. Advice: use rechargeable batteries and a large SD card (2 or 4 Gb) cause the video is so good that you will love shooting. Also, must of the times you will need the flash indoor other way you will have bad pics; with flash results will amazed you. 
I initially had a canon S1IS (just 3MP, 10x optical, CF card) and needed an upgrade for the same as I was visiting Disney, LA. The S3IS (6 MP, SD card) delivered with gusto with its image stabilization and higher ISO modes. I have a full video and reasonably good snaps of the Disney parade during the evening darkness (switch to highest ISO with the dedicated ISO button) with: 1. Amazingly low jerkiness due to the image stabilization. The IS here is of course better than the S1IS. 2. The snaps came allright even with the maximum zoom - if there are slight blurs, you can maybe use software like coral to adjust. As others have said here, yes, a tripod is the best, but who has the time or the patience to set it up. 3. Even many of the disney fireworks snaps came out ok in the night mode with the maximum ISO setting - though of course a tripod would have helped in the darkness here, for sure :) 4. Best value for price. In Nov 2006, a nice deal would be getting this camera within 350$ as in Amazon. Two things here: 1. I would not be buying a videocam as I had planned earlier, the S3IS vidoes suffice for most situations - sending videos to AFV for instance. 2. For the last point, I would recommend waiting for 3-4 months till the 4GB SD cards come into the 50$ range. But as others have mentioned before, please have at least a 2GB card. Look in Amazon or in Fry's as I did for 35-40$ deals on 2+ GB cards 
My search for a semi pro Digicam made me do a lot of research and after I shortlisted a few models I had to find the best deal. Amazon helped me get that deal and today when I look at the performance of the camera so far.. I am amazed... The camera was bound to be good but a special thanks to Amazon.com for helping me get one at a gr8 price 
Great camera, easy to use after reading the manual. Light, easy to handle. Unfortunately a little pricey 
This is my second Canon. There is a lot of whistles and bells on this camera that will take time for the novice to figure out. My biggest complaint is trying to remember to take off the lense cap before turning it on. My other cameras did not have the cap. All in all it takes excellent quality photos, so you will not be disappointed 
Works great as point-and-shoot in auto mode. Camera has just enough advanced features to keep the novice photographer happy for a long time. Battery life is great if you purchase top quality rechargables. A large, at least 1G SD card, should be used. Image stabilization works well. Tripod is necessary if using camera at full zoom 
This is a great camera for those who need more than a point and shoot but do not want to carry a bag full of lenses. Also, with a large SD card (1 to 4 GB) this camera will replace your video camera. One thing to note, when you take pictures while recording video, it stops recording a second or two while it processes your picture. This is very obvious when watching your video 
Over the last 50 years, I have purchased four film cameras and five digital cameras. By far, the Canon S3 IS is the best camera I have owned. And most of the cameras I have bought cost more that the S3. I returned recently from a three-week trip to Scandinavia and St. Petersburg, Russia. During the trip, I took almost 2500 photos with the S3. The photo quality was excellent, the camera controls were easy to use, and the camera performance was outstanding. I expect to use the S3 for many years. 
I bought one when it first came on the market back in May. Half a year and 5,000 pictures later, here are some of my comments: - It is a GREAT digital camera in its own class. By "class" I mean one should not compare it with a dSLR because the S3 is not one. So do not expect it to overcome "shutter lag" easily, although among other DC (digital camera) I have used, shutter lag on S3 is greatly improved--to a degree that I feel comfortable taking photos in very fast pace, e.g., catching flying birds. (However, only good dSLR can completely eliminate shutter lag and S3 is not a dSLR.) One also should not compare the S3 with the "small" point-'n-shoot DCs. S3 is not as small as those--it won't easily slide into your pocket, unless your pocket is relatively big and loose (like mine). But the slightly larger body brings great features none of the small DC can offer. - Big optical zoom (12X) and IS. 12X is GREAT and combined with Canon's Imagine Stabilization, S3 turns into a powerful large zoom camera with superb imagine quality. My recent trips included shooting (with cameras in case you wonder) wild wolf at Yellowstone National Park. And this little S3 came out as the only one that can capture the animals at great distance, along with other "big guns" the professionals carry. The IS feature eliminates hand shake with great effect and I could shoot at 12X with low light and still get quality photos. I also highly recommend the "TC-DC58B Tele Converter Lens" for the S3 (or S2) which gives you another 1.5 zoom that effectively make S3 18X zoom (equivalent to a 600mm lens). Check how much those big telephoto lens cost (close to 10K) ... - Excellent video shooting. Again a feaure one almost never finds on any other DC or dSLR. The S3 takes DVD quality video in stereo sound, not just video clips that most DC can do. This little (almost) pocket-size camera now forces our digital videocam into an early retirement. - Many other great features. However those are more or less standard and one can always try to argue some other DC may have similar or better features. I won't comment on those. In summary, the S3 is a great small-size DC. Its superb lens offers big 12X zoom and IS, two technology of Canon's pride. It also offers DVD video shoot with stereo sound--this feature alone can save you a digital vidoecam. One suggestion--do get a big SD card if you want to shoot video too. I have a 4G SD card and I think 2G is a must. Also battery life is excellent. It uses 4 AA-battery, which seems a lot odd at the beginning. But it comes in handy because as long as you can get AA battery you never worry about power. With typical dSLR, if the battery is out you are done for the day unless you find a power outlet to recharge (and have your charger with you). I do have one small complain. The Menu button at the back of the camera is at the location where my palm presses the body. Sometimes I raise the S3 and I see the menu in viewfinder because my palm has pressed it strong enough to trigger it. Another press is needed and I lost several shots because of this. I have other dSLR with quality lens. But I always take the S3 with me on any trip 
Fairly decent. Produces pictures with optical blur on the edges if you use zoom. Leaves black semicircle on pictures taken with a flash about 1/5 the way up from the bottom on the picture because the flash isn't tall enough to miss the wide lens. Other than that.. it does capture a few more degrees. If you are going to pick this or the telephoto attachment, get this. 
Though I am not qualified to write about the quality of the filters, they seem to be doing the job pretty well. The finish is good and they fit well with the 58 mm Canon lense for my Rebel XT. The lense cap goes right over it so it is doubly protected. The small pouch to hold the three filters is also of big help to keep them safe and easily accessable 
These are the second set of filters I have purchased and I am absolutely love it. I have to buy a new set because my other lense is 62mm and these are for 58mm. It produced outstanding colors and great quality filters. I would recommend it, and for the price, that's how much you would have to pay for the polarizer filter alone 
I purchased the filter kit for my Sony Camera. The price is considerably cheaper than Sony's and the quality is great! I'm looking into other items offered at a good price from Opteka 
This camera has lot of modes that you can use. It has very good resolution and optical zoom. With 12x optical zoom you can click awesome pictures, specially in live performances and sightseeing trips. 5 MP resolution is more than enough, otherwise the pics become just too big to fit in one screenshot. You can also panoramic pictures with it. The only two complaints are - flash recycling time should have been lesser, and the SD card that comes with it is only 16 MB, which is hardly enough for 7-8 pics. You will have to buy a 512 MB or 1 GB SD card separately. Also, the batteries that come with it are not rechargeable, so you will have to buy charger and batteries as well, which are not so expensive. But these drawbacks are there in S3IS also. Overall, this camera gives very clear pictures and is worth buying if you happen to get it at a decent price. 
This is a great camera, easy to use, love the quality and even best, got this quick as can be with Amazon PRime. HIghly recommen 
When I first got the camera I was nervous about whether or not I'd be able to use understand it well since I usually buy point shoot type camera. I was pleasantly surprised on how easy it is to use all the functions it really has. The pictures are really high quality the video is crystal clear. The camera's lightweight perfect to grab on the go or to capture any occasion. I like the design of it I love the fact that I can get professional looking pictures time time again... 
I had viewed concert photos taken with the S2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away. Saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they didn't even come close. I was using the Canon A80 prior and while I was happy with it, my first round of photos with the S2 proved to be most impressive. While you can use this as a point and shoot, this is a camera that you should spend some time learning so that you can get the most from it. And although the S3 is the latest version of the camera, I'm not sure you get that much more for the money 
I got this Canon camera back in May for my birthday from my husband. Once I got it home it was very easy to learn and use. I have actually not even used all the features yet...because there are so many. This is my 3rd digital camera and 1st canon...I have to say that I will stick with canon for now on...I use to always like Kodak but canon is much better. I print off the pictures using my Kodak printer and everything still looks great! I love canon so much that I just bought a Canon Camcorder ...and I hope that it is just as nice as their digital cameras. I highly recommend this camera for families...I have used it in live action and after you get the hang of the image stabilizer everything turns out well.....I feel that I will use this camera for a while and when it's time to upgrade to another camera I will stick w/ Canon.. 
I bought the Canon PowerShot S2 IS about a year ago, and have taken about 2,500 photos and about 15 video clips with it. Overall, I am very happy with it, and if I were buying a new camera today, I probably would get the S2 or S3. Things I like about the S2: * Extended zoom (12x). I use it often. * Image stabilization. Particularly helpful when using a high zoom factor, or when shooting in low light with a low ISO setting. It makes handheld shots at slow shutter speeds possible. * Electronic viewfinder means "what you see is what you get", just like an SLR. While not as sharp as an optical viewfinder, the ability to frame the picture without worrying about parallax more than makes up for it. In fact, one advantage over an SLR is that there is no mirror for it to move out of the way, therefore there is no mirror noise when taking a picture; if you turn off the electronic sound effects, it is very quiet indeed (although not completely silent). * The screen moves and rotates. I like that it can be closed (turned in toward the camera) and thus protected from scratches. I have used it folded out and rotated forward in order to see myself in a self-timer photo. I have used it to take "clandestine" pictures--holding the camera down near my waist, I can still see the screen if I rotate it towards me. I have also used it to take pictures while holding the camera above my head--above a crowd, for instance, or over a wall. * Multiple-picture mode. Similar to a motor drive in film cameras, this allows me to take several pictures in quick succession by holding down the shutter release button--about 2 pictures per second. And unlike some cameras, the only limit to the number of pictures is the amount of available memory. * It can be used in all-automatic mode, all-manual mode, or just about any combination in between. Even in near-automatic mode, several exposure settings can be adjusted. * Very good movie mode. It will shoot a VGA-quality picture (640x480) at 30fps. While the results are not as good as my 3-CCD DV video camera, I am much more likely to have this camera with me than the video camera, and I really like the option of taking a reasonably high quality video. I have used it several times. * Stereo microphones. Decent sound for video. Can also be used for adding a sound memo to a still picture (e.g. "this is at such-and-such a place, blah blah blah"), or just for recording sounds unrelated to any picture. I have used this a couple of times to record a "sound memory" of a place; one was at a botanical garden at a spot where the scenery wasn't especially pretty, but the sounds the frogs made were like nothing we had heard before! * Separate buttons for still pictures and movies. Easy to remember which is which. * Manual pop-up flash. Some people don't like that the flash doesn't pop up automatically when needed. I actually like this feature, because often I want to shoot without a flash when the camera thinks I need to use the flash. And of course I can force the flash to fire even in bright daylight when the camera thinks it is not necessary--although for a while I kept forgetting how to turn on that feature on, even though it's pretty obvious (there's a button right next to the flash!). Things I don't like about it: * Poor low-light performance. More precisely, poor performance at high ISO settings. The camera will do fine in low light if you leave the shutter open long enough, or use a flash. But if you kick up the ISO to 200 or 400 (equivalent to a "fast" film) so that you can take indoor shots without a flash, you end up with very noticeable graininess in the pictures. This is my number one disappointment with the camera. However, I don't know of a comparable camera that does better (and from the sample pictures I have seen, the S3 isn't any better; I don't know why they bothered to add an ISO 800 setting--it seems completely useless to me). I know there are cameras that do, but they cost a lot more. I saw pictures taken indoors with a Canon 20D SLR that were phenomenal. But besides the added expense, a camera like that is also bigger and heavier, and therefore less convenient. * The camera is too big for a pocket. I would love to have a camera as capable as this that would fit in my shirt pocket, or at least my coat pocket or a smallish holster. I would take it more places if it wasn't so big. * And yet, at the same time, it's a little too small for my hand. The grip just doesn't feel right. The grip on the 20D felt GREAT! However, it's just about right for a woman's hand--my wife likes it fine. * No filter threads in the standard configuration. A big lens like that is practically begging for fingerprints or scratches. I solved that by adding the conversion lens adapter, which does have filter threads (more about this below). * Lens cap is held on by friction. This is both a pro and a con. It's good because the lens extends when the camera is turned on; if the lens cap is attached the lens will simply push it off. It's bad because the cap could come off when you don't want it to. This is a moot point with the conversion lens adapter, as the standard lens cap will no longer fit. * The default exposure is too bright. Not every review mentions this, but apparently it is fairly common for Canon cameras. Fortunately, this is easily fixed by setting the exposure adjustment (I set mine to -2/3 stop). I haven't figured out how to adjust the exposure for movies, though. I need to look in the manual to see if it's possible! If you buy the S2 (or S3), I'd suggest also considering: * Canon LAH-DC20 Lens Adapter and Hood Set. As I mentioned above, this allows you to add a filter to protect the lens. Currently $37.10 at Amazon. * A 58mm skylight or UV filter to screw on to the lens adapter. * A 58mm lens cap to cover the adapter/filter. Canon's 58mm Snap-On Lens Cap is currently $9.99 at Amazon. * A high-speed SD card, at least 512MB, but 1GB or 2GB would give more space for movies. (I use a SanDisk Ultra II Plus, which has the added benefit of being able to directly plug into a standard USB port without an adapter.) * Rechargeable NiMH batteries. I don't have any yet, but this is the next thing on my list. I've gone through way too many AA batteries! A nice option available for this camera is the TC-DC58B Tele Converter Lens. This gives you a maximum zoom equivalent to 648mm on a 35mm camera. Amazing! I have not purchased it yet because so far the built-in zoom has been sufficient for my needs. There is also the WC-DC58A Wide Converter Lens for taking extra-wide-angle pictures. After you get the camera, you'll probably want a case of some type for it. There are *lots* of cases to choose from. After trying a few and looking at a lot more, I finally settled on the Tamrac Velocity 4. It may or may not be what you need in a case, but there it is FYI 
Are accessories like the lens converters, the wide angle and long angle lenses, and the filters that I purchased for the Canon Powershot S1 IS compatible with the Canon Powershot S2 IS or the Canon Powershot S3 IS? I am looking to updgrade, and I want to know what costs I will have other than the camera itself and the memory (since the S1 IS used Compact Flash memory). Thanks 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
I mainly bought this to go on the end of the lens adapter for the S2 IS. It does well to protect the lens, but you can't put a lens cap over it. It ends up being easier to use without the lens cap...and quicker when taking pictures. The pictures are very good through it 
Works well on a normal camera Tried it with adapter on S3 IS and adapter does not fit robustly. Filter is O 
I was concerned when I ordered this filter about the previous problems reported here. But, I was in a hurry and needed two of these for vacation. There was absolutely no problem with the product. Both filters were sealed and in perfect condition. Could have been packed a little better in the shipping box, but arrived in good condition. No problems with photos taken with this product 
I took a few identical photos with and without this filter, and saw no difference in sharpness nor contrast. So, if you're looking to save damage to your lense, this is the way to go. I like being able to clean this filter quickly. Otherwize I would spend 10-20 minutes cleaning the lense being so very carefull not to scratch it. Also, it can minimize UV haze... but I havn't compared with/without for that type of situation. (PLEASE COMMENT IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ... (BRAND) 
Ordered one in March and its came in fine (not used or abused like others have mentioned). Amazon.com was the retailer. I use it mostly for the lens protection aspect and it works great, in fact I'm ordering another right now 
I never take my UV filter off of my lens unless I am going to immediately put on a different filter. There are basically two camps out there, those that feel you should always use a UV filter to protect your lens from dirt and scratches and those that feel it is a waste of time and only degrades your image. Well, I tried going without one for awhile and then dirt started to build up on the front element of my very expense lens. And although you can clean the front element of a lens, I feel much, much safer wiping my comparatively cheap UV filter time and time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage. I think for the nearly unquantifiable loss in image quality you may suffer by having a UV filter on, it is well worth the extra piece of mind it gives me 
I was looking for a medium range zoom for my D-70s that was reasonably fast and sharp throughout the zoom range. This lens is a first class winner in all areas. It is my first VR lens (vibration resistance) and that alone makes it worth the cost. No more tripods! It is smooth in operation and feels very solid (if not a little heavy) to use. The f/2.8 speed coupled with 8 aperture leaves gives a velvety smooth bokeh (desirable soft blurred background) that makes your subject snap right out of the shot. The len is razor sharp from 70mm to 200mm. If there is any distortion, I haven't seen it. With a lens this long, ghosting might show up if you shoot almost directly into the sun. The huge HB-29 lens hood helps a lot. Again, I have not seen any ghosting yet. This is definately a pro/pro-sumer len and its price tag alone re-enforces that fact. If you can afford it, remember the golden rule...it is the lens that makes the picture not the camera. All the pixels in the world can't make up for a poor lens. If you are ready to play with the big boys, then this belongs in your bag 
This lens is superb. It feels like a high quality pro lens (not surprisingly). The shots are just stunning; fantastic color, razor sharp, beautiful bokeh etc etc. I initially considered the 18-200(VR) until I saw comments about this lens. Look into it, from what I can tell there is very little (real) comparison between the two. I believe you will forget how much you paid as soon as you see the results. Did I mention this lens is superb....? 
This lens has so many uses. Anytime I can position myself where my subject is more than five feet away, this is my lens of choice. I have the kit 18-70mm that came with the D70 and a 50mm prime (I have the 18-200 VR is on order, and if Nikon can ever get around to catching up with demand, that lens might surpass this one, due to the smaller weight - plus it is a lot cheaper). I took every lens I own with the D70 to the British Museum in London. Shooting handheld in available light (I never used the flash) with many of the Egyptian and Greek artifacts over fifty feet away, I got outstanding results with this lens. The VR technology is amazing. Having a constant 2.8 aperture was also a major advantage. I'll grant you my arm felt like a rubber hose after four hours of site seeing, but it was worth it! I have had similar satisfaction using the lens outdoors for wildlife photography. I have even used the TC-20EII teleconverter with the lens, to shoot hummingbirds at great distance. I would have no reservations about recommending the lens, until Nikon announced the 18-200 VR. This new lens has a much broader focal length on the low end, and focuses much closer (around a foot, compared to five feet for 70-200). The 18-200 does not provide a constant 2.8 aperture across it's focal length, so the 70-200 would be better at long distances in low light. But at less than half the price, and I think less than half the size, this new lens clearly will have a premier spot in my bag. Will it totally replace the 70-200VR? I'll update my review when I finally get to try the lens on the block. Until then, the 70-200mm VR is the champ 
This is it. I upgraded from the Sigma EX f2.8 80-200. I should have spent the money for the Nikon the first time. The Sigma is a very nice lens for less, and a good alternative, but if you want it all, go for the Nikon. Leave your tripod at home when you get this glass. I don't know how this compares, but I'm shooting hand held with 1/30s shutter at full zoom (35mm equivalent of 300mm). The VR is phenomenal, the wide aperature delivers beautiful blur, and the overall fit and construction is flawless. Tack sharp images too 
I have used this lens for over 6 months now and have over 1k shots through it. It is as fantastic as others note herein. The 2.8 through the focus range is really great. Superb. The VR function is really a neat trick. It is super fun to play with. The drawbacks are size and weight. After a 1/2 hour of shooting, your arms will get tired. Remember to be careful and hold the lens and not the camera. This lens is definately heavy enough to bend/warp the camera body 
I love this lens. This is an excellent complement to my Nikon 28-70 2.8. It is well balanced on D200 and F100 (with MB Grip). Just last weekend used in a Family Wedding. It is really not a lens for casual photography. If you are not willing to tolerate heavy equipment, sincerely, you will take much better pictures with PS digital cameras, as I sometimes do. After all taking pictures is about capturing moments and if this lens will get into your way, it has no use. I personally only prefer fixed 2.8 apertures across the zoom range. This is very important for me since I like to use mostly Aperture Priority especially taking people's pictures. That is why I love this lens. This is a very expensive lens. If VR is not important to you, go with more reasonably priced with almost identical optical qualities Nikon 80-200 2.8. To me VR is very important since I cannot afford to use Tripods when I am moving around and taking pictures of my kids or friends. If you could afford it, it is a great lens that you will never regret. If you cannot afford it just you are thinking on purchasin expensive Camera Body, don't waste your time on camera specs, D70 vs D200 vs D2Xs etc. Buy cheaper camera, but still buy this lens as long as you are willing to carry heavy equipment around and comitted to take pictures with such heavy equipment. Bokeh is amazing, rich contrast, creamy blurring behind a subject with 2.8 is simply delicate and delicious 
This lens has only two "faults." First, it is big and heavy--quality construction often yields a heavy lens. Second, once the photographer has seen the results that this lens can produce, there is a likelihood that he or she will be unhappy with the other lenses in the camera bag. Results first: the images are razor sharp with this zoom mounted on my Nikon D70s. I can get shots that I never could get before because this lens is so crisp that subjects taken at a distance nevertheless can be cropped to produce an acceptable close-up image. Subjects taken at more normal distances are breathtakingly sharp--as if shot with an excellent prime lens. This is a fast lens (F/2.8 throughout its entire zoom range). Almost more importantly, this lens has the best "Bokeh" that I have ever experienced in a lens. "Bokeh," to the extent that I understand the concept (it is a Japanese word meaning roughly "unfocused"), is a word describing whether the out-of-focus portion of an image (i.e. a blurred background in a photo in which only the subject is in focus) has a pleasing look to it. This lens produces wonderful, creamy Bokeh. The sharpness and Bokeh, combined with the excellent bright color rendition of this lens, makes this one a true classic. I have occasionally experienced minor ghosting on this lens when shooting into a very bright subject, i.e. the sun reflecting off of the ocean. This is a normal shortfall of a zoom lens comprised of a multitude of elements, and I have sometimes experienced this. But such occasions are rare. The autofocusing action of this lens is very good. Even birds at very long distances usually produce a quick, snappy autofocus lock on my Nikon D70s. Very seldom does it "hunt" for an AF lock, and these occasions are likely due to operator error rather than the lens. This lens also features Vibration Reduction (VR) which enables it to produce acceptable images below what an F/2.8 lens would otherwise be suitable for. The VR really works, too, although it is by no means a panacea for dim lighting. This is one of Nikon's professional lenses, and the quality of construction is excellent. The critical mount is metal, and the entire lens is built like a tank. The lens comes with a nice squeeze-style lens cap, and a very good lens hood that can be easily reversed for storage. The reader can see that I am extremely enamored with this lens. The reason is that, notwithstanding its bulk and weight, this lens produces the best nature shots that I have ever managed to take, by far. 
Yes, this lens is already legend, and no, it's not just a bunch of people trying to justify spending a whole lot of cash on a lens. Make no mistake, this lens is BIG and expensive. It's not fitting into your travel bag nor is it at home at a friend's party. For that bring the 18-70mm, 28-200G or just bring a cheaper P type camera in case you spill beer on it! The 70-200 VR is a pro level lens that gets almost everything right. It's size is the byproduct of an optical design that really makes few, if any compromises. This lens is SHARP...as sharp as my 50mm prime and sharper wide open that you might believe or expect. On a D70 the focus is lightening fast and quite exact. Color rendition is the best I've seen. I do much less post processing when this baby is on the D70. On the problematic side, this lens is BIG. It's heavy and in the way, though reasonably easy to grasp. I added a Harbortronics portrait grip and the handling/balance is improved. It needs a big bag and focuses down to a bit under 5 feet. While it's a fantastic portrait lens, you need room to get the most out of it. My first shots with this lens put my more experienced lenses to shame. The bokeh, or quality of out-of-focus areas were creamy and pleasing. Subjects had a 3D quality to them. The VR system is exactly what you'd expect. I sat on my couch, framed the text on my DVD player about 8 feet away and shot at F/2.8 ISO 200 for a 1/2 second exposure. At 200mm (300mm on the D70) the image was sharp. Without VR I got a big blur. The real question is: Do you need a 1700 dollar lens? Answer: Only if you want it. The quality is all there at a level that has people talking about this lens like it's magic. I have friends who shoot pro with Canon and Nikon. Even the Canon users say the 70-200VR is the best of it's kind. Sell a kidney and buy one 
This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens. 
Filter works good for general use and protects against some of the light relection. I would purchase it again 
I buy this UV filter to protect my kit lens(18-55mm), so far so good. I am using a canon rebel xd. If you just want to get a cheap UV to protect your lens, buy this one 
Puts a protective glass over your expensive gla$$ without distortion. 
It is better to save the camera's real lens which can be replaced with this filter being broken than the expensive lens behind it. This is a real "lens saver" 
I get at least a UV filter for all my lenses. That's the cheapest insurance you can get for you lense. Protect it from possible scratches and banging against objects. Haven't really seen a major difference between the brand filter and the Tiffen filter. I would just go with the cheapest filter to be found for you lens 
After overpaying at a fancy camera store, I was happy to purchase an identical filter from amazon for a fraction of the price. These filters give you piece of mind, protection from sand, fingerprints and baby spittle 
This gadget is a must-have for gadget lovers.....and picture lovers. It is compact, solid and fits any small pocket or clutch bag. The images are crisp if you get it set appropriately. If you love attention get this product and if you don't .....not to worry the camera gets all of it. 
I am only giving 4 stars, because i just receive it through mail a couple days ago. So i still haven't get a chance to fully try out everything. But I can tell you this camera is very handy, it's very small that i can throw it in my small purse (my purse usually don't have much room, b/c i would already had so much stuff in it, like my PDA, i-pod, cell phone, wallet, keys, a pack of tissue and et.c) and take it with me to anywhere. I love the design of this camera, it's very cool. Pictures are pretty clear, even the one taking during the nights. Another thing that i love about this camera is that it's not noisy, and it's very quick (i have no patience, so it's good for me that i can snap pictures crazy quickly). Overall, I find this camera pretty good. 
I recently purchased this camera and it is very easy to use and takes nice pictures. I bought a case to put it in so I could keep the screen from getting scratched. Go out and find a generic camera bag that will fit it. They are so much cheaper than Canon's camera bags. The only thing about this camera that I would like to change is that I wish it had a battery life indicator. 
After waiting months for an order to be filled and then getting screwed by customer service/returns, I decided never to buy from Amazon again. Go to an electronics or camera store, you'll get better service and the fresh air will do you good 
This camera fits easily in my pocket and takes fantastic pictures for an ultra compact. It is easy to use and I have had no problems with it 
I like Canon's digital camera because it is everything an average person may want. It is light, with great design, works incredibly good and I can make hundreds of pictures. Isn't is a dream come true? Highest recommendation 
This camera is easy to take anywhere, easy to operate and best of all takes great pictures of my 2 boys. Highly recommended. 
I've upgraded from an older Canon A series to this SD600. Price I payed was just under $250. Purchase a spare battery - they are small and worth the small investment to carry an extra, and get a bigger memory card, 6 mp take up more room so you need more space. 2.5" screen takes is a great size and good clarity. Except in extreme brightness (outside direct sun) have no problem reviewing my pictures. Like with previous Canon's this camera is user friendly and easy to use. Automatic settings adjust light and settings to take the best picture and it cuts out the guess work of doing it in manual. Downloading is a snap. The computer interface is easy to navigate and pretty self-explanitory. 6 mp is all I need. I take a lot of pictures for work, and often have to zoom in on the picture to see details - this resolution is just perfect. Good balanace between picture quality and jpg size. Any bigger, the files become a pain to email (especially with size limits) and deal with. Look for a snazzy red case for this camera - this fit is snug and the case is rigid so it gives the camera and screen extra protection without a lot of extra room. I just slip it into my purse or pocket - it's really small without sacrificing functionality and ease of use. 
I have a Nikon D50, and when attaching the camera, the tilting base of the tripod needs a little compensation for the camera weight. Hence, I haven't found any use for the libelle on the tripod. I have to look through the wiev finder to see if my set-up is level or not. Overall though, it's not a big problem, and hey, with the price of the tripod, I'll live with it 
I have a very small camera (a Canon SD450) and find this tripod to be a perfect match. It is light and small and easy to carry with the included canvas case. It has a few nice features that I didn't expect (even though I read the text!) like the bubble level on the platform. This product is an excellent value. However, the shipping cost as much as the tripod. Of course, that is not the tripod's fault. 
I really looked hard at the various light (sub-3 lb) tripod options to use with my Canon Powershot S2 IS. Lighter the better, but I also really wanted a 3-way pan head and all of the little nice extras that I could get: bubble level, quick set-up/tear-down, fits inside of carry-on luggage, good build quality, comes with a bag, good hand crank, etc. It definitely fit the bill perfectly, and was ONLY 2 lbs! Of course you don't get super strong wind-proof stability at that weight, but I was really quite happy with the overall stability on my recent vacation. When there was a strong wind, I leaned a bag, backpack, or beach towel around one of the legs and that gave me more piece of mind... but I think it probably would have been fine... especially when not fully extended to max height. Before buying it, the max height was actually my only real concern -- would it be tall enough to take good people pictures/outdoor portraits while I was on my vacation? My experience says -- Yes, great people shots (and so much better than the typical shot you get by asking a passing by stranger to take a photo for you)! Don't hesitate, just buy this one! 
I received this tripod for Christmas and I am totally delighted with it! It comes with a case and is small and light enough for me to carry. In just a few days use, it has made a difference on my low light level and non-flash photos 
This stuff worth for your small money, useful for your precious cameras 
This cleaning pen is just as advertised. I have used it on a daily basis since I got it, and it has never failed to do a great job. I use this with the VisibleDust Huricane blower, and the combo is unbeatable. Great value for the price 
Practical and essential for SLR photography. Specially usefull to carry with your equipment 
Lens pens don't do a perfect job, but they do a better job than anything thing else I have found. It is a "must have" product for anyone with a camera! And the Nikon lens pen has worked well for me 
I was skeptical when I ordered the pen because I wasn't too sure how clean it would really keep my lens. Last week I traveled through out Mexico and visited some beautiful places, along with seeing a lot of family members. With all these family members around, a few accidently touched my lenses. I decided it would be a perfect time to test my new pen. End Result? PERFECTION! The lenses looked like thru were brand new! I used to carry little paper whipes designed for lenses, but now I use the Nikon Lens Pen and I don't need to worry about carrying whipes and throwing them away 
I bought this for the convience of keeping my lenses clean durring fast furious wedding shoots. It has worked beautifully. It works great for taking off fingerprints and wiping away dust. 
I bought this pen for my boyfriend for his new Canon Digital Rebel SLR, but you could use it for almost anything with a lens. It's got a small brush on one end to swipe away big stuff, and a round felt tip on the other for cleaning smudges. He finds it very useful and it fits right in hiw camera bag 
When it comes to cleaning my digital camera lenses, i'm very afraid of damaging something, so this little and cheap product takes away all the fear, and all the dust from my lenses. --- Cuando se trata de limpiar los lentes de mi camara, me da mucho miedo que se daï¿½e, entonces con este pequeï¿½o y barato producto, fuera miedo y fuera polvo 
This handy little tool is a must have for not just Nikon owners, but all camera owners. A genius of design and function, I would whole-heartedly urge every person with a camera to buy one, or many, asap 
Only problem is I live in Holland and have to have things sent to my daughter in the US and then forwarded since you don't ship overseas. Any hope that may change in the future 
The Canon 250D and 500D are doublet type close-up lenses which are corrected for chromatic abberation ("achromat"). They offer better performance than the less expensive singlet type lens. I have been happy with the performance of these lenses used on an EF 100mm/2.0, even when used stacked together for higher power (which Canon does not recommend) 
I'm surprised to see that a lot of people only give 1* to this camera! I've had it for 2 years now and i just love it! Thanks to it, I discovered I had a real passion for photography... It's very easy to use and my pictures are great! When I show them, people usually tell me " you must have an expensive camera"... and i just show them my little Canon S500 and they are surprised with the result! I'm just loving it 
Over 90% of pictures I took by this Canon are blurry. No way can you fix it. I really got fed up with it. Waist your money. Waist your time. More important, waist your precious moments! 
This was my first digital camera that I have ever bought, and I am completely satisfied with it. Talk abt the resolution or the camera's feature. All of it is packed into one small sleek camera. I recommend this digital camera to everybody. And I would say if I would decided later in future to get another one. I would alwayz go for Canon. They are the best in making Digital Cameras 
I needed to replace a lost S4oo we had for about a year. Looked at the SD series and thought them too small for comfort. There is such a thing as too thin to handle comfortably. The S500 is, like the S400, just right in size. Big area on back for thumb so you an even one-hand hold it. Try that with any SD. Pictures are excellent for a hand-held. Not Nikon N70 film SLR good, but plenty good enough for any snapshot purpose. Bought one of last new S500's available at NewEgg abd very, very happy with it 
Don't buy this camera!!! Prone to "Memory Error" E18 errors after warranty is up. Cost min $150 plus shipping to fix. This camera was great until 23 months went by then I started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors. I switched memory cards and it happened again. Then the "memory error" displayed after a month or so of losing pictures. Now it doesn't work at all. I called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem. Minimum cost is $150 or I could upgrade to a refurb S500 for $199 w/6 month warranty. They have to be kidding, $250 get me a new one. For what appears to be common problem I was expecting more from canon. Guess I won't be buying another canon. Google this "Canon "Memory Error" E18" and see for yourself that Canon cameras have problems. 
This pouch is a Godsend so I bought 2. I use them for my EFS 60-mm and EFS 85-mm Lenses. The base feels firm so the lens sitting inside is protected and won't go anywhere and is made out of a strong naugahide. The pouch itself is thick felt and the rope pulls are made of heavy nylon twine that feels silky in your hand. The whole pouch is well built to protect but can be handled roughly and still protect the contents, your precious lenses 
I used this SB-600 on my Fuji S3 digital camera for a friend's wedding. I found that you do need a diffuser (such as an omni bounce), otherwise you get shadows. And it works great bouncing off the ceiling to fill the whole room. This flash is easy to use, reliable and the batteries didn't die until picture #637. I had no instances of it not going off when I took a picture ever 
This flash preforms with excellence ! All Nikon products I have are of pro grade. This flash recycles fast and is ready when I need the extra light for fill and main light. I purchased the SB-600 for the D-200 and am very happy with it. I have used it for the last six weddings this year and for shooting action shots of skate boarding compitions. R.Wolf, Atl.GA 
I purchased my SB-600 a day before my granddaughter's birthday party at our local skating rink. With very little time to test the unit prior to the party, I dove right in. I was amazed at the exposures from very close shots to, believe it or not, the entire length of the skating rink. The auto-zoom is a really cool feature that changes to match your lense setting from wide to telephoto. I made about a 150 shots the first time out using NiMH batteries with no significant drain. At this time, I have found absolutely no negative points. I may even purchase a couple more and replace my portable Photogenic studio lights 
This flash is unbelievable, most the time I use the built-in filter because it is so powerful, great value for the money. Just takes some practice getting it adjusted correctly as I said before it really throws the light out there. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
I love this flash. I just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly. I still don't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual. I would definitely recommend this flash. 
I've been quite satisfied with my Nikon D50 and I've been using the built-in flash occasionally to get evenly lit images and balanced exposed shots. But the built-in flash just doesn't cut it. I made the huge mistake of taking pics at my cousin's wedding reception in a huge hall thinking that a tripod, high ISO settings, and the built-in flash will suffice. I was wrong. I borrowed a fellow photographer's spare speedlight (SB-600) and when I downloaded the pics to my computer for some fine tuning, I noticed the HUGE difference between the built-in flash. The speedlight gave me more area to be covered by the flash. For roughly under $200+, this is quite the bargain. I'd recommend rechargeable AA batteries. The recycle time for the flash is FAST. 
Well priced and works beautifully. No complaints - does exactly what it said on the tin. 
Finally was able to put some money aside and get a new flash for my D50. I looked at the less expensive Sigma flashes, but in the end I decided to go with the Nikon. I figured I spend the money on the camera, I'm going to get the better flash. Used it the other day and took some great portraits of my daughter. The flash worked like a charm. It is better than the on camera pop-up flash. The pop-up flash comes in handy if you can't or forget to bring the main flash, but it is really nice to have the extra power of the SB-600. If you think your going to do a lot of indoor photography (birthdays, holidays, etc..) this is a great flash. If you have children, the best bet for portrait photos,,, the Nikon D50, Nikkor 50mm 1.8 and the SB-600 flash. Great combination for a very good price. We haven't had to take the kids to have their pictures taken at a studio. With this set-up, you can take great portraits of your kids in their own environment at a more convenient time that you and the kids decide. And no traveling in nice cloths to worry about 
I bought this flash for use on my Nikon D200 and it works better than I had hoped. You can fine tune it for your own personal liking and it has more options than I am currently smart enough to use. But don't worry, you don't have to be a super camera geek to get great results right off the bat. This thing has great "reach" as it actually zooms right along with your lens to pinpoint your subject. It's just audible enough to let you know it's doing that. I'm definitely glad I bought this thing. MUCH better than the small pop-up flash 
This what i discovered when i've used my brand new 1D markIIN Well, I have to say that I am truly impressed with this camera. A friend of mine got his about a month ago, so I have played with it a little bit, but since I got mine on thursday, I have really gotten to explore the many features and performance differences beween this camera and the 20D that I upgraded from. Having used a few original 1D cameras, a 1D mark II, the 20D with battery grip and a 5D, the size and weight of this camera really doesnt bother me (I have heard so many people complain about the size and weight before...) I actually really like the feel of the 1D mark II N. There is only a slight difference between the original 1D Mark II's feel and the N, but if you hold them side by side you notice it. The autofocus is absolutely stunning. Having used a 20D for a year and a half, I had forgotten how nice it is to have those 45 highly sensitive autofocus points! As soon as you pick up this camera and hold that shutter button half way down, you realize why this is the #1 choice of many of the best photojournalists. The body construction is the highest quality I have ever seen in a camera, but of course is very similar, if not identical to the other 1D series cameras. Compared to the 20D and 5D though, this thing just feels solid. Another stunning feature is, of course, the speed at which the 1D Mark II N can capture images... 8.5 frames per second! Just as the 1D and 1D Mark II have done for the past few years, this camera holds its own to all other cameras in its class, with 22 frame raw bursts at 8.5 frames per second. I hardly ever shoot jpeg, but i did test it and found the 48 frame buffer to be quite impressive. Packing two 2 gig Sandisk Ultra II cards (a CF and an SD) I have the capacity for about 450 total shots. The screen, of course, is fantastic, and blows any Nikon camera's menu and image review quality out of the water. The 1.3x crop factor is certainly an improvement over the 20D's 1.6x, and the bigger sensor definitely yields better image quality in low light due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio. Overall, color reproduction, metering, exposure and sharpness are all much better than the 20D. since i love wildlife photography I have been able to get 75% more caption information than I ever did with my pervious cameras The camera performs great in the studio, and images are beautiful, as would be expected. I have yet to make any photographic prints from this camera, but I'm sure they will look stunning. 
This camera is simply amazing! I started out with a Canon G2, and then a Canon G6, and then a Canon 20D, and now this Canon 1D Mark II N. I debated and researched for 3 months between the 1DS Mark II, 5D, and 30D. My decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5D and this 1D Mark II N. Yes, I wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 MP like the 5D, but you know what? It practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally I made my decision to go with this one and I'm 110% glad that I did. For me, this camera is definitely THE ONE to get because the 45 point Focusing, 8.5 fps, and the 1D Pro Body/Interface/Menu/Layout, etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor. Trust me, if you don't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is, you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide. Because of this 8.5fps alone, I'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that I normally get lucky getting with my 20D. And with a 5D at 3fps, I just said forget it...No way. I'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living. This is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20D to this camera is out of this world. With the phenomenal auto focusing, additional metering, it's like I'm now playing with a Bentley (with the 1D MK2 N) coming from a Mercedes C230 Hatchback (The cheapest Mercedes that people buy just because it's a Mercedes name and they don't want to spend any more money on a real Mercedes). This camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro. Also, I don't shoot action pictures all the time, and I do love portrait photography, and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures. But even with the 1.3 crop factor, there is still a HUGE improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you won't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you'll have on a 5D. With this 1D MK2 N, you can still take wonderful wedding photography, landscapes, etc. As much as I'd like to have 12.8MP like the 5D, 8MP is really all that we need these days unless you're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8X10's or around there. Unless you're printing extremely large posters and whatnot, you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5D can. The resolution and MP is definitely enough. Plus, it's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to. The extra bonuses with this camera which I look at as a secondary positive, are the weather seals, pro-build high quality construction body, easy to use and navigate menu system, you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times, dual memory card capability, you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently, built-in battery grip (you don't have to shell out extra for this), longer battery life than the other cameras, best customization and most options that you can set to your liking, more than the 5D or the 20D or 30D. I could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it. Otherwise, the 5D is also a great choice too if you need to save the money, and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long, or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments, and don't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that's great for ai servo. 
This is an excellent camera! I purchased mine in Feb. '06 and have used it continually for 2+ months before I decided to write this review. First, I am an avid amateur photographer, and I wondered if this camera would be worth the expense, for a non-pro. I've found that I do not regret this purchase in any way. I researched it for several months and even bought the Digital Rebel XT first, thinking I'd rather not spend so much for a camera (I like the Rebel XT and it is a fun back up camera)....and I was confused as to which camera to choose. Most official reviewers either did not review it, because there was not "much" difference btw. it and the ID Mark II or simply said that if you wanted to shoot sports or fast action, then the 1D Mark II N was the way to go. I don't shoot those...I'm a wedding/portrait person. However, I do also shoot landscapes and fast moving animals as well and wanted the weather proofing and speed that comes with the Mark II N. So choosing between the 5 D, the (at the time) upcoming 30D and the 1D Mark II N was very difficult. One pro review site said that the Mark II N was a needless upgrade to the Mark II. I found that an odd remark because Canon changed almost everything that they didn't like in the Mark II. You can record both in RAW and JPEG at the same time, on different cards. A 2.5" LCD that can be magnified from any point, to check the sharpness, there is a definite absence of noise in shadowed areas and you do not have to pair this with an L lense to get excellent photos. Aside from my L lenses, I use the 50mm 1.4, the 70-300 DO and the 85mm 1.8 with excellent image quality across the board. I am a small woman and found that the camera's weight takes some time to get used to. However, the camera itself is so fast that it compensated any camera shake I might have had, due to the weight, by it's speed. And, now that I am used to it, I hardly notice it. The multitude of control buttons can be confusing, but if you are used to the 1D Mark II, it's not a difficult switch. If you are used to the Rebel XT, keep the manual handy for your first few times out. Whether you shoot in JPEG or RAW, the photos manipulate well in photoshop and you don't lose any quality (in my opinion) for not having the 12 megapixels of the 5D (which was 1 of only 2 reasons why I considered the 5D). Large enlargments (16x20) print up quite excellently and again, you have the speed to NEVER miss a shot. I've found that in shooting portraits with difficult to shoot subjects (children, pets, someone who DOESN'T want to sit for a portrait but his wife is making him...), SPEED does matter and often it's saved me from a failed shoot! The 1.3x FOV crop factor (vs. the full frame 5D) is definitely a factor to be weighed. Frankly, I use the 17-40L and get excellent landscape photos. As wide (at 22mm) as I could ever wish, and not get "fish-eye". So, I don't find the crop factor to be a personal issue but it was something I had to take into consideration in my choice. While it limits my 24-70L and my 24-105L to only 31.2mm at wide angle, it gives my 70-300 DO IS that "just enough" extra zoom boost (to 390mm) that I don't have to buy yet another expensive lens. I've been trying to think of the negatives of this camera, in order to give a balanced review. As I said, initially the weight was an issue as well as learning the controls. Both were quickly overcome. The cost is definitely a factor, but especially for anyone who does this for a living, it is definitely worth the $. I like everything about this camera (and I've gone through several others to get here). When I don't have it with me, and find myself with my A620 (my "in the purse" emergency camera) I get so frustrated that the A620 won't do anything even close to what I've now come to expect as the standard for all cameras. So I guess that's the one downside, because it's a large SLR, I don't carry it absolutely (though almost!) everywhere. However, overall, unless you want to pay close to $7K for the Ds and the extra megapixels, I don't believe there's a better camera on the market. I realize that while this review doesn't cover all the technical specs (you can get that on either cnet.com or the-digital-picture.com) I hope it helps someone like me who had a really difficult time making the ultimate decision 
The Canon 1D Mk IIN is the bomb. I opted for this camera over the cheaper and higher megapixel camera, the 5D. It is rare that you need more than 8M pixels and the sharpness and speed of this camera is nothing short of amazing especially when comparing to my other digital slr, the Canon 20D. This is a camera that I will enjoy for many year 
Very solid camera, but a bit heavy. Good battery life. It is a very professional camera 
With a wicked 8.5 frames per second, this is a sports/action/photojournalists dream camera. If you need the speed this is the one. Aimed squarely at sports shooters and photojournalists, Canon has done it. If you are looking for more of a portrait/art/wedding camera get the Canon 5D 
This was my first digital camera. I received it as an anniversary present; My Fiance thankfully has *Great* taste. Anyhow, This particular camera took by far the best photos I have ever seen! The pictures were EXTREMELY crisp. I thought the camera was very user friendly and a lot of fun to use. I used it for 13 months without a single problem. Until it was stolen. :( So now I have decided to upgrade to the Canon SD700. By the way, I have tried out all of my friend's and family's digital cameras just to compare theirs to my canon and not a single one of theirs could compare to the pictures that my canon A520 took... So try it out, you won't be disappointed!!! 
The Powershot A520 On Switch stopped working right after I started using the camera 
the cover over the lense broke/small lcd screen/ pictures are pritty good/battery life is pritty good/some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady/takes nice portaits/ easy to use/ has a veiw-finder 
I have developed a dimple in my right retina that places a blur in the center of my field of view. I am right handed so my right eye is my "sighting eye". this device gives me the clearance to use my left eye to focus and compose my shots. I love it 
I purchased this extender so that I could be more comfortable looking through the viewfinder. 5/8ths of an inch doesn't seem like a big difference, but it is enough to put some space between your face and the camera.  Having your face pressed against the camera is a good thing, as it helps to stabilize the camera reducing camera shake. However I find the 20D very uncomfortable without the extender. My discomfort comes more from how the eyepiece cushion rests on the eye and not so much from a smashed nose. The extender doesn't prevent the camera from pressing against my nose, although it clearly doesn't press as much. My face still is in contact with the back of the camera. The eyepiece cushion feels more comfortable pressed against the eye with the extender in place. To install, you remove the eyepiece cushion from the camera, slip on the extender and then reattach the eyepiece cushion to the extender. The extender does reduce the magnification in the viewfinder, but not enough to be an issue for me. The extenders can be purchased with your eye glass prescription strength in mind so one doesn't need to wear their glasses when using the camera. This particular extender does not correct vision. This extender stays on my camera at all times. PROS: Gives your nose some breathing room. Adds comfort CONS: Reduces magnification in the viewfinder 
As an eyeglass wearer, I suffered needlessly for years 
When digital cameras first came out, I, like many people swore I'd always be loyal to film. Digital could never take the place of film. I'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely. There's still something I love about putting a roll of film in the camera, shooting away, sending the film to be processed, and seeing the results. I also know it's a bit expensive. I know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion, but digital cameras are improving in this regard, and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving, we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital SLR and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera. So I figured now is the time to get a digital SLR. I have been a loyal Nikon user for nearly ten years, and have owned the Nikon N60, N70, and N80. My first love was, and still is the N70 (I've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought I was the only person who loved the N70). I purchased the N80 only after my N70 cost too much to repair, but I've enjoyed the way my various Nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if I don't have the time to use specific controls, but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes. My Nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes, wildlife shots and all sorts of other things I can't resist to capture forever. I decided to purchase the D70 since it was close to what I've already experienced with Nikon. In many ways it works in a similar way to the N70 and 80, except it's a digital rather than film version. Like the film versions of the midrange Nikon SLR's, it has a dial that allows an automatic setting, portrait, landscape, sports, close-up, nightscape, and night portrait modes, the ability to select aperture, shutter speed or manual controls. The camera has auto and manual focus abilities. Photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires. The controls are easy to use, though it takes practice to be comfortable. On a personal level, the camera has passed the Halloween test, niece's birthday test, and fall foliage in New England test and favorite scenic spots test. The only real difficulty I've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting. Auto focus has not worked at all and I'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots, but at this point I'm sure it's the photographer and not the camera. I do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera. The manual is very confusing. It uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else. I've had luck with the "Magic Lantern Guides" with my other cameras, but have not as of yet used it for this camera. I did purchase the NIKON D70 FIELD GUIDE (David Busch, Wiley Publishing) which has been helpful. It can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with Nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography. 
I've had my D70s for about a year now, haven't regretted it for a second. The controls are laid out logically, with everything to hand. The dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate. I personally love the optional grid overlay, I have no excuses for horizons that aren't horizontal. The wireless flash system is great, though you have to buy an SB-600 or SB-800 to get the full benefit. This camera is bigger and heavier than the D50 and D80, which in my opinion is a positive thing. 
I am a professional photographer, and I have owned this camera for nearly two years. I also have a D70 for backup. The batteries go forever, it is very quick to respond, the images are beautiful, and it has the typical Nikon durability and reliability. If you are already a Nikon user, the controls will fall easily to hand. That having been said, the computer software with this camera is a joke. For the best image quality shoot RAW files, color balance with a grey card, and render the images with software like Capture One LE. The uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars. Come on, Nikon, be real!!! Shortly after I got my first D70, I shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog. I got an ugly feeling in my gut when I was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure, cropped to the head and shoulders, and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog. By the time I found out, it was already at the printer. As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great. After that incident, I have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results. This camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button. In resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera. It is imperative to shoot RAW and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera. I can't wait to try the D80 
I do weddings, portrait, and outdoor photography and I don't see any reason why I'd ever switch from the D70 (other than the D80 :). This camera is professional grade at the consumer price point. Don't be scared by the 6.1 MP. I print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems. I'd recommend reading Thom Hogans manual 
The D70s is a minor update of the original D70 introduced in 2004, with a few new features and a slightly larger LCD. It's still a great camera, but expect it to be replaced by the new D80, which has 40 percent more pixels, a 2.5-inch LCD, and additional useful features at the old price of the D70s. So, you can probably save a little money and still purchase a sophisticated digital SLR if you wait until prices of the D70s stabilize at a new, lower level. At, say, $600, this camera would be an incredible bargain. The D70s has shined as one of the best cameras in its class since its introduction. For example, it has a 1/500th second flash synch speed (found in no other camera but the D50) so you can keep ambient light under control and avoid ghost images. Its autofocus is fast and accurate, and features both single-autofocus, continuous-autofocus (for tracking action), and a novel "automatic" autofocus mode that switches between AF-S and AF-C as required. If you have no Nikon lenses, get this camera with the 18-70mm kit lens, which is very sharp and versatile, rather than the more limited 18-55 lens. You won't regret it 
Excellent camera kit. Versatile. I have a lot to learn about the camera, though, as it is no simple point-and-shoot. However, in Auto mode, it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. I look forward to learning how to use it fully. Lenses came with warranty cards, but the camera itself did not. I bought the SB-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 GB compact flash cards to round out the kit. Camera with lens attached is large, which I underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. Great camera, though. Price was the best I could find anywhere 
Im not from USA. My brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working!! It has serious conection problems in the body that I cant fix in my country. I lost 1000 US 
It has a learning curve, that's for sure, but WOW! This camera is worht every penny, far more stable then the comparable Canon Rebel, and the product comes with better lenses. The quality of glass DOES matter 
I have owned this camera for about two months now and have taken about 100 photographs (keepers) to date. Because I have been involved in photography for almost 35 years, I have developed certain prejudices. In particular, I have never been comfortable with auto exposure and even less comfortable with auto focus. In fact, the last auto focus camera I owned was a Nikon N8008s that I ultimately sold at auction because I could not adapt to using the various auto settings. However, I like this camera. Why? The D70s is a very easy camera to use and I have only had to refer to the manual to check on a couple of settings and look up some features. Honestly, set up takes only a few minutes and handling is not terribly different from a film camera. I should point out that this camera is really designed for auto focus lenses and if you choose to use your manual focus lot, you will disable many of the camera's features.  Because I am both stubborn and cheap (but mostly only when it comes to spending money on myself) I am using my manual focus lenses on this camera. It is true that I do not get any internal exposure meter readings and must rely on a handheld Gossen or the sunny 16 rule (quite effective, really) for exposure determination. The LCD preview screen thus is critical for determining or adjusting exposure. I should also point out that the depth of field preview feature is also lost when using manual focus lenses. I was stunned when I could not stop my lens down and burrowed through the manual to find out what I was doing wrong--which was nothing except that I was using the wrong type of lens. While I really miss this feature, I am not sure how big a loss it really is because of the viewfinder. Others have made mention of the low magnification and tunnel like views through the finder and I can attest to this fact. I compared finder views to my trusty old FM and was just stunned by how poorly the D70 compared. Ultimately the best camera is the camera you use and the D70 has become my camera of choice. Even though I am using this camera like a vintage M series Leica--i.e., handheld meter and presetting exposure in anticipation of a photograph--I find that I can live with this level of usability. At some point I will probably buy an auto focus lens (maybe the 35 f2) and make full use of the feature set. But for now I content on using the camera the old fashioned way 
This is a quality piece and can take good close-up pictures of still objects. I was looking for something to capture moving/flying insects, this is not what I needed. My fault not the lense. 
I'm looking for a closeup lens for my Canon EOS Rebel XT. But before buying I wish I can see some pictures taken using this lens 
This is an excellent add-on close-up lens, not to be confused with the relatively inexpensive 1-2-4 sets sold as aftermarket accessories. This is a double-element achromatic (color-corrected) lens made by Canon and recommended for lenses in the range of 50-135mm focal length. It is very sharp and clear with no color fringing. The "250" indicates the maximum distance to the subject is about 250mm with the main lens focussed at infinity. The actual lens power is about 4.0 diopters (+4). It has a 58mm outer thread so you can add a clear filter (UV or Skylight) to protect the lens surface. I am using it with a Canon A620 and the required adapter, and it produces outstanding pictures with excellent detail and sharpness. 
Don't be disappointed because this isn't a lithium ion battery. This battery kicks butt!! It lasted me 3 days of non stop shooting. I started to think that the battery was never going to die! Of course reality set in and had to eventually charge it, but it lasted forever!! The only drawback is that it takes about 2 hours to charge:( Other than that, it will lasts you all day and night 
I got this lens to go wider on a 20D. I wanted to go wider so I got a 5D. Started shooting events with this lens and I learned that the 580ex couldn't give me enough light in the dark. Used the lens during the day. Terrible problems with lensflare. The hood showed up on the edges of pictures (wide). Went back to the 24-70L as my primary lens. When this lens works and circumstances are right, the results are stunning. I'm trying to use two flashes to get the power to use it at night, again terrible flare problems. Whenever it matters I have to go back to the 24-70L. I just don't have all these problems with it. The problems with the 16-35 lens appear at the wide end. At 35 the lens operates well but that's not what I bought the lens for. I love the lens but it's the lens that gives me the most frustration and worry. Wish it had cost less but what can you do 
I got this lens because I didn't really own anything close to this range except for the kit lens (good but not great and not f/2.8). I do own a 15mm Canon Fisheye but it does distort quite a bit even on the 20D and I don't like to have to correct in Photoshop each time and I wanted a wide lens. I wanted something wider, that could capture lots of light (I do allot of ambient and low light photowork) and I wanted something versatile (on a 20D this is really a 24mm to 56mm --- great working range). Pros: 1) With the 1.6x crop factor of my 20D this is really a 24 to 56mm lens. This makes it quite a bit less of a wide angle and more of a midrange lens. Consequently, it stays on my camera all the time and covers most of my daily needs. I bought this lens fully expecting it to be 24 to 56 as I wanted it to be multi purpose and at 24mm its still pretty wide. 2) I try to avoid flash as much as possible given the type of photography I do and at f/2.8 I can take some great ambient light pictures that I would not be able to do otherwise 3) At f/2.8, I can also blow the backgrounds and foregrounds out of focus. The out of focus areas are gorgeously buttery and the blokeh is very nice given the 7 blades of the shutter. 4) The color saturation is like nothing I've ever seen before except with my 70-200mm Canon "L". I was literally floored at some baby pictures I took where the colors were in two words "mind blowing". I knew the color would be great but "WOW!" With Photoshop CS2 I can "fake" saturation but its just not quite the same as the color that came out of this lens straight out of the box. Zero photoshop touchup needed. 5) Its sharp! This lens takes some amazingly sharp pictures into what I would classify as amazing. I've received numerous positive comments on the sharpness of this lens. I've tried looking at the edges to see if there's any CA or less sharpness and couldn't really find any. Maybe on a full size sensor you can tell more but I couldn't really on a 20D. I do notice that the plane of focus at f/2.8 is narrow (which is good) and I have to make sure that everything I want in focus is. The blokeh is very buttery at f/2.8. I like it quite a bit. 6) Its built like a tank. Black metal shell. Metal EF mount. Smooth manual focusing. Sturdy recessed switches. The red stripe catches the eye of photographers who know....easy to strike up conversations and learn. 7) It was surprisingly smaller and lighter than I thought it would be. About half the size of my 70-200mm Canon "L". I was expecting it to be bigger and am much happier that it wasn't. Its on my camera all the time and not a chore to carry around at all. Unless you're a very petite person. 8) Internal focusing. So the lens size doesn't change in size or turn when focusing. This is very useful when you put filters on or when you're focusing in close. 9) USM Motor. Its whisper quiet and it focuses super fast. Faster than my 70-200mm....something I'd expect but wow its fast and silent. 10) It focuses pretty close 12 inches or so. You can get close to your subject. Its not a macro lens but you can get some dramatic wide angle shots with its close focusing. 11) Its TTL2 so works very nice with my 580EX flash. 12) EF mount will grow with you. If you upgrade your camera body to a full frame camera with an EF mount, this lens will fit your new camera and you can continue to enjoy your lens investment. Cons: 1) On a 1.6x frame size, it doesn't get into "amazing" wide category but that's not the fault of the lens. I'm marking this down as a Con but you can take it several ways. If you want to get ultra-wide on a small frame camera, you won't with this lens (although 24mm is pretty darn wide) and about your only Canon options are the 15mm fisheye which I own and think is a great specialty lens, the 10-22mm EFS Canon, and the 14mm L. The 10-22 I hear is very good but its EFS (and won't fit the full frame cameras - less upgradable I think) and its not an L lens although for a non-L the 10-22 I hear is exceptional. The 14mm EF L will run you almost as much as this 16-35mm zoom. The 15mm EF Fisheye is wonderful but it is designed to distort and the distortion is visible on the 20D and even more so on full frame cameras and you need Photoshop to fix. On this 16-35mm L, if you want the f/2.8 and are ok with something like 24-56, then you won't find better for small-sensor cameras. I'm very glad I got it and, if you already have a full frame camera or upgrade at some point, you can enjoy 16mm "WOW" wide. I can only imagine the coverage I'd get on a full frame camera. 2) The hood is massive...wide but not very deep...so its a shallow hood (It has to be with the wide angle I guess). I never take it off -- it keeps stray light out and is a secondary protection for the lens. I have had zero problems with lens flare. 3) The front lens element does sink in and out inside the tube (exposed but the lens case doesn't change in size). There is no protective filter to protect that front element. I bought a UV/Haze filter ($26 from Amazon) and I highly recommend you do as well to protect your investment. With the UV/Haze filter, the lens is very self contained. 4) Oh the cost....my oh my. Expensive as heck. Cost as much as my camera body --- worth every penny. If its any consolation, these lenses are very hard to make and they keep their value. Your camera body might drop in value as new technology arrives but this lens will hold its value if you take care of it. Differences, Notes, Things I've heard: 1) I have no experience with non canon lenses so I can't compare but this 16-35 is amazing. 2) Compared to other "L" lenses, it holds up and the quality is amazing when it comes to color, performance, lens construction. 3) I hear there is some Chromatic Aberation at the edges of these wide lenses (well more than the 70-200mm) but that's to be expected when you're gathering light from such wide angles and focusing it....that's got to be hard. Wide angles exhibit more CA than long telephotos. On my 16-35mm it wasn't visible to me. I imagine a Pro's pro might notice care. Anybody with less stringent requirements than a Pro's pro or extremely saavy person, couldn't even notice or care. Besides, CA on this lens is orders of magnitude less than almost any other lens. 4) I bought directly from Amazon. Ordered on a Monday got the lens the next day on Tuesday. Amazing service. Great store. 
I shoot with a Canon 20D and have used the Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM lens as my wide angle option. When preparing for an extended stay in Budapest, I decided it was time to invest in a faster, better quality WA lens. I reviewed the lens lineup at the Canon website and decided on the Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L. As an L lens owner, I was confident this lens would be a great addition to my lens lineup. Being an L lens, this is a serious lens meant for serious photographers. The sturdy construction consists of three aspherical elements and Canon's UD glass which largely eliminate the secondary spectrum. Weather-resistant construction at lens mount, zoom focus rings and switch panel helps protect the lens from the elements. This lens is not compatible with the 1.4x II and 2x II extenders. The Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L lens weighs in at about 1.3 lbs/600g, and accepts 77mm filters or holds gel filters. Be sure to get a good quality UV haze filter to protect the front lens element. Not only do I see this as a good practice, Canon recommends doing so on their site as well. The focus type is the standard twist zoom, and permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. In addition, the lens has a USM drive mechanism for optimum AF performance. Included with this lens are the front and rear lens caps, lens hood, soft storage case, and a US one year warranty. The case is a pull string soft case (LZ1319) that can also be purchased separately. The lens hood (EW-83E) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations. I have to admit I was disappointed by this lens while in Budapest. I found that for wide angle scenes with the focused subject at a distance, the images were soft. This is precisely the type of images I wanted to use this lens for. Just because this is a fast lens, it doesn't mean I shoot everything at f/2.8 either as some may claim. I have a good understanding of exposure and know how to use the aperture setting to my advantage. It didn't matter what aperture I used, distant subjects were soft in my eyes. I wondered if the lens needed adjusting or calibrating after hearing all the great things people say. I lent the lens to a friend who loved the quality and sharpness while taking close up shots. I then began to wonder if I was doing something wrong. After testing the lens, I've concluded that this is not the lens for distant wide angle shots like suggested on the Canon website. When the subject matter is much closer, like the other side of a room or several feet away, this is an awesomely sharp lens.  The Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L lens is too different to compare to the Canon EF 28-135mm. The clarity and sharpness is incredible on close-up shots, and the auto-focus is quiet and quick. Even though this lens didn't fit my original purpose, it has found a place in my lens collection. I don't foresee this lens being one of my most used options though. The Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L comes at a price, but it is worth every penny when used for its strengths. PROS: Incredible clarity and sharpness on close-up shots Quiet and quick auto-focus CONS: Heavy and bulky (This should be expected with these types of lenses) Distant subjects come out soft 
Having received some Christmas cash, I put it to good use with the purchase of this lens. It works great with my Digital Rebel and certainly is a fine choice for any of the EOS Canons. Sure, it is pricey and a little heavy, but if you want a fast, wide-angle zoom lens, there is little else that is equivalent. The zoom range takes you from wide scenics to excellent indoor flash shots at 35mm (with a Canon Speedlite EX accessory). The USM focusing motor is quiet and very quick. Comes with a Canon lens hood. Don't forget to add a 77mm UV filter to protect the optics full time! 
We dedicated a thumb drive to use with the digital photo frame that we download our digital pictures to from a computer. Then we simply plug the thumb drive into the USB port of the digital photo frame and follow the menu instructions to select the USB port thumb drive by pushing a couple of buttons on the digital photo frame. The slide show of the pictures we view from approximately ten feet away have very good resolution. It's great for family gatherings and have received many positive comments from our guests. 
This item shows all of your digital photos in bright, vivid colors. Set up a slide show and play directly from a memory card. The frame is light, portable and easy to use. A great companion for your digital camera and is an excellent way to show off your pictures to friends and family. Just pop in the memory card from your digital camera and your ready to show off all of your precious memories. Features * Bright 5.6" Active Color Screen * Auto Start Slide show function * Supports Photos up to 12M pixels * Includes AC Adapter and Quick Start Guide * No Computer Required, plays directly from memory cards * Brilliant Color Display with adjustable contrast and brightness * Automatic Slide show, Full-Screen Browse, and Thumbnail Browse Display modes * Compatible with major memory cards (CF/SD/MD/MMC and MemoryStick 
Excellent product. Easy to get it started. Great features, clear pictures. Everyone that sees it wants it 
A great idea poorly executed. The construction is cheap. The screen is marginal at best. But worst of all, it refuses to recognize any of the 3 digital cameras I have on hand or a USB card reader. A piece of junk that I am now returnin 
The Digital Photo Frame was easy to use and the software was excellent. I gave the item as a 50th birthday gift and set it up at a very large party. The frame showed a slide show of about 65 pictures and became a focal point for the guests. Everyone spent time looking at the pictures of the family from throughout the 50 years. Many asked where to get the frame. It was a hit and it worked as described 
The picture quality is better than I expected. You still can't see the picture from the sides, but straight on it's good. The interface to load my pictures was very simple. I would like to have a few more options available, but for simplicity purposes, it works great 
I purchased the 8 X 10 Photo Frame as a way to display photos at my wedding reception and planned to use it in my home thereafter. I was able to get the product running and to load a 'test' set of pictures, but the product then 'froze' at the startup screen. I checked the Pacific Digital support website, which provided steps (basically, a sequence of buttons to hold down) to 'unfreeze' and reinitialize the unit. I tried this sequence several times, to no avail, and then called Pacific Digital customer service. After repeated messages left on a voice mail system ("we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back to you") at all times of the day and night, I was unable to contact anyone at the company and no calls were ever returned. Long story short - our wedding came and went, the problem was never (and will apparently never be) resolved, and the Digital Photo Frame is now a $390 paperweight. Absolutely useless. My recommendation: DO NOT PURCHASE A PACIFIC DIGITAL PRODUCT. This is clearly a fly-by-night outfit 
I am new to SLRs and I cant belive how good this camera is. This camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces. I always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent, but looking back, they look terrible compared to this. 
I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camea, its beyond description... 
This Camera is excellent one!! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category, I'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles.. Highly recommended 
It is extremely easy to use. Hard to figure out the menu, but once that is done there is no problem. Takes beautiful pictures. Great for action shots as well. Seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in 
I had 2 Rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses. While I had owned other digitals I keep going back to my old Rebel, until now. We got the back up battery pack. My husband and I love it 
I already had a digital rebel and was able to sell it to a co-worker and use the proceeds for my new rebel xt. Faster, lighter, better. Simple review. It took everything that was great about my digital rebel and made it better. Some complain that it feels "too light"...OK...it that's your thing. To me, it's still solid and the pictures speak for themselves. Now, with the addition of the 10 MP rebel xt, I'll bet the original xt can be purchased for an even better price. No downsides that I can think of.. 
I have had digital cameras for about 5 years and still own an Olympus 5 megapixel, and a Casio 7 megapixel. Seems like Megamixels alone just don't cut it for me. I read about the rebel XT in a magazine and looked up the user reviews here on Amazon. I decided to go and buy one and though I am really a novice, I am extremely impressed. I have never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors from a Point Shoot. I started with the basic settings and love the results.I am slowly progressing to more advanced settings and am getting better everyday. Even a novice who just wants stunning photography will be amazed with this camera. I also bought a Tamron 75-300 Autofocus zoom lens (look for it here on Amazon.com) and after lots of practice, have been able to take some great pictures. I have a brother in the UK who is also into digital photography, and after seeing some (full reso) photos I sent him, he rushed out and bought the XTi (called the EOS 400D across the pond)and is amazed with it. I still have a lot to learn but really cannot fault this camera. The included software is also excellent. For the record, some reviews seem to think it is too small to hold, I have big hands and don't have any problems at all. I admit though this is the first SLR I have ever owned. I will still keep a point and shoot to keep in my travel bag for spontaneous photography but I am in love with my Rebel XT!! This camera costs quite chunk of change but I think it is well worth it and I do recommend it to everyone 
I'm really impressed, I bought the SD-110 a year ago as a quick small digital for trips. I was never planning to take it diving. The housing is really impressive, I've done 4 dives in the month I have had the waterproof case (WP-DC10) and it works great. I was so excited to try it out I went in the water with a full memory card. I got down to about 35ft and took my first picture and "Memory card full". It was easy to navigate all the buttons and I was able to delete while following my buddy. Taking pictures of fast moving fish doesn't work out and the range of the flash is 1-3ft. My deepest dive so far was 109ft off the Monterey coast, and I worked as if it were in 10ft of water 
Canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price. I purchased this for a recent trip to Grand Cayman and Cozumel. I didn't go Scuba diving on this trip, but I did take the camera snorkeling (diving to depths ~20ft). It worked flawlessly and I got some pictures I was very happy with! One thing I did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water. Going from AC to the hot humid outdoors, my EOS rebel fogged up (condensation) and even after 30 minutes I couldn't take good pictures. With the SD110 in the UW housing, I just wipped the housing's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and I was able to take clear pictures. The instructions are pretty good, but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the O-ring seal for cleaning/lubing. Once I figured it out, it wasn't so hard. The SD110 may be getting a little old, but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing I don't have so much money tied up in the system that I would be devestated if it was lost or stolen. I will probably upgrade to the SD550 or SD500 (they both use the same batteries as the SD110) with the WP-DC80 or WP-DC70 housing at some time in the near future, but I will definitely keep the SD110 and WP-DC10 as backups 
If you swim in the ocean, lake, or just like to be around water and want to take pictures, this is the thing to have, it's worth every penny!! The only thing you can't do when it is in the case is upload pictures to your computer, change out memory cards and charge the battery. It is truly amazing. I've had my eye on this for a very long time and with a cruise coming up I knew I had to get it. I'm a snorkeling enthusist and this is definatly the thing to have. Instead of those silly disposable cameras that limit you to only 27 pictures, and you haven't got a clue of exactly what you've taken a picture of, you can take as many as your memory card will allow you. There is also a filter for the flash you can slide into place to help dispurse the light to get that ideal picture underwater! 
I bought the SD110 camera, and since I live in Hawaii, I HAD to have the underwater housing for it. This housing is great, because it allows you to use all the function buttons while the camera is protected in the housing. You can power up the camera, shoot, zoom, change modes and do everything but change the battery, change the memory card and upload your pics onto a computer while the camera is sealed up. I was able to take lots and lots of underwater and surf pictures and movies with this camera. And I was very happy with the results. I treat my gear pretty rough, I was in the water almost every day, not cleaning it all the time and although the housing did get scratched and a little banged up, it still worked great, and it didn't affect the quality of my photos. Then one day while rescuing a swimmer in distress, the camera was knocked off my kayak into the ocean. I went back a few minutes later to search for it. But was unable to find it....I was really bummed. Four months later, a friend of a friend is diving in the same area that I lost the camera, and saw something wedged in the reef, encrusted with coral and alge. He pulled it out and took it back up on the boat-it was a digital camera in the housing. When he opened up the housing and took out the camera.....it powered right up !!!! So he took a few shots on the boat and then took the camera home. He showed it to his friend, and they flipped through the pictures as he told him the story of finding it. One of the pictures that I had taken on the day I lost it, was an underwater self portrait. When my friend saw that: he knew who's camera it was !!! So he calls me...and tells me the story. I was amazed. We figured that the camera and housing had been lying on the bottom for four months in over twenty feet of water, and there had been a few storms that had produced some very large surf in that area, so it had likely taken a beating. But it still maintained its water tight integrity. We were all very amazed at how durable it turned out to be !! I had already replaced the camera with the Canon S500 and it's dedicated housing (mostly so I could get higher resolution photos). After uploading the photos onto my computer, I let the guy who found it keep it. He has cleaned up the housing, and it stays still water tight, the only thing wrong with it (besides a little surface crud on the exterior of the casing), is that a few of the buttons are jammed and so they do not work (the zoom, shutter and power buttons are fine). But not bad at all for a camera that had been on the bottom of the ocean for several months 
Having recently picked up the hobby of digital photography I was not aware of the nuances and the importance of some of the accessories. Back in "the day" when shooting 35mm film I could barely afford the cost of processing - let alone what I thought were fancy accessories. Well - some reading and a trip to Alaska with my Canon Digital Rebel XT - I learned, and appreciate, the importance of a lens hood. I bought a rubber lens hood (not lens specific) at a local camera store that was totally unacceptable - then bought the lens hood for my Canon lens from Amazon. It works great - no flare - no vignetting - and it makes the lens look pretty cool too! I would suggest having a hood for all your lenses and never shooting without - along with the obvious - it saves the front of the lens from bumping damage which is important with longer lenses or tight quarters like shooting on a photo excursion boat full of other people all jockeying for a shot! Amazon service and prices - as usual - were fantastic and although I HATE to wait for things - I am usually happy I do when I order from here. Happy snapping!! 
The lens hood performs as it should by limiting stray light but it is a little sloppy and comes off easily if bumped. It is easy to attach and reverses quickly for easy storage. Pretty much a no brainer but for the money I'd like a little better fit 
This small and cheep hood can save you realy a lot of money. It's doeing it job wonderful keeps you pictures brigth and clear, but also the hood protect you lens from a lot of things which trying to hit you lens 
Pros: - Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element. - Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile 
Nice hood. It's designed for the Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens and therefore does what it's supposed to. 
Nice Quality, but overpriced. Does a nice job of protecting the front of the lens, and reducing glare in some situations 
when the hood is reversed on the lens, it blocks the zoom ring tremendously when at 17mm's. it's not the end of the world, but you're probably better off storing this in a bag, and not on the lens itself when not in use 
I had this camera for years before it was stolen and I replaced it with a digital Canon SLR. I am still amazed at the abuse I put my Rebel 2000 through. It has a nice light body, a great auto feature, and easy-enough to use manual functions. And because of the popularity (and rightly so) of digital these days, you can pick one up for a fantastic price, even brand spanking new 
I have had this camera for about 4 yrs now - I take it on all my business travels. Whenever I get a chance to go out on on the weekends, I take this camera and my Sony camcorder in my backpack, roam the streets of the new city and shoot pictures. The pictures that I shoot from this camera are just awesome - no matter whatever experiment I do with it. Most useful features: 1. Aperture control with Depth of field preview - Lets to focus the foreground and blur the background 2. Shutter speed control upto infinity - Lets you control the amount of time for which the shutter can be kept open 3. It is pretty rugged, dont try dropping it :) I have used it to shoot pics from 'Maid of the mist' in Niagara falls and I almost thought that I was going to lose it. But it worked liked a charm Negatives - Bulky, but you will get used to it, it always gets attention - Cost of developing film - What I do these days is to just get the photos on a CD, then develop only those photographs that are good. Why is this camera better than a Digital Camera ? - If you are spending $200 on a Digital Camera, I feel that the SLR is way far too ahead of any Digital camera in that price range - If you are spending $1000 on a Digital Camera, a Digital SLRs are very mature today - worth buying. Ideally, I would buy this SLR, take this whenever I really want to take good photographs, then I would also want to have a $100 Kodak Digital Camera for casual shots. This would mean an ideal combination. If you are buying this SLR, you can also consider buying a Film/Photo scanners (available for less than $150 now) - which lets you scan the negatives/positives without even going for a cheap CD print. From the reviews what I read on amazon, these scanners must be amazing 
I bought this camera for my wife for Christmas 04' I thought I ordered it too late for it to arrive on time for Christmas, but these people are great! they got it to me on time and we love this camera we use it all the time - we have several accs. item for it and the quality of the picture are wonderful . Thanks Mark Christian 
I started off with a fully manual camera that I used for my photography classes a few years ago. Once I was ready to upgrade, I came across this camera and fell in love with it. There are enough manual settings to keep me challenged, but the easy automatic settings make this camera perfect for all of my everyday shots. I have taken wonderful, professional quality shots without even changing the settings, and my 14 year old sister found the camera easy to use even though she has almost no knowledge of cameras. This camera is great for photographers in all stages and learning levels, because the pictures turn out great every time and it has enough range to get a great shot no matter what mode you use it in. I really don't think I could ever say enough about this camera to acurately describe it, so my best advice is GO OUT AND GET ONE! You will not regret it 
I am a ameture photographer and I love my new camera, I also enjoy my low price Amazon Your the Best! Im so happy that I finally found a price I can Afford!! Thank You! 
Item was exactly as described. Works perfectly and helped make some great shots at Yosemite 
ive used this product about twice and dont really have any major complaints. my pictures came out great. i used it at a drag strip and needed it for taking pictures of the cars flying by at nighttime and i was able to capture them nicely due to no camera shake (using a tripod of course as well). the only thing i dont particularly like is that it goes into the lock position quite easily taking extra pictures that arent needed, and also the small hole for the wire to be inserted in for packing doesnt really hold it that well and the wire just kinda unravels, but i would recommend it to anyone who has a need for it 
I don't know how I ever did without this little item. Its indispensable for taking pictures with a tripod. It works easily and efficiently exactly as describe 
Worked well while I took pictures of fireworks over Lake Tahoe on the 4th of July. Only wish camera accessories with Canon logo weren't so expensive. 
Using photoshop, and being a big fan of bulb exposures the RS60 E3 is a must have accesory. You can use it just as you would the shutter button on the Digital rebel, as well as lock the shutter open, which is very good for painting with a small flashlight, etc. My only qualm with the switch is the shortness of the cord, but if you're trying to take a self portrait with the remote, then you need to get the Infrared remote. The two of those combined makes for a perfect pair of tools for any remote picture taking needs 
It does what it says it'll do, and while it's pricey for a couple of contact switches in a plastic handle, considering the cost of parts and my time to make something similar, it's a bargain. I would have liked more heavy duty construction, and the contacts to have more definite tactile feedback for the focus vs shoot position, but it works just fine, and it lets me take pictures while talking more easily to the subject, in addition to the obvious vibration reduction 
I purchased this Canon Remote Switch about 4 months ago and I use it almost constantly. This is one of the most useful camera accessories that I have purchased. Every photographer should have one in his/her toolbox. A remote switch is essential if you do photos in low light or macro photography. The slightest movement of your camera when you press the shutter release could cause your photo to be ruined. This switch eliminates "camera shake." Before I purchased this switch, I had to use the self-timer feature on my camera and the time delay was very inconvenient. There have been a few reviews saying that the Canon Remote Switch is over-priced and cheaply made. I don't think that is true at all! I would definitely buy this accessory again. 
The Canon EF 85mm f1.2L lens has earned ample praise from photographers and critics alike as one of the finest portrait (medium telephoto) lenses available. It is the only one currently produced with a maxium aperture of f1.2 (About a decade ago Carl Zeiss introduced a special, limited edition 85mm f1.2 Planar for its Contax manual focus 35mm SLR system; this lens is alleged to be optically superior to Canon's.). This new improved version of the 85mm f1.2 can autofocus 1.8x faster than its predecessor, via a USM motor for relatively whisper-quiet operation. A fine optic for working under low-light conditions, the lens is now better due to its improved optical design and faster autofocusing. Without question it has been one of the finest L series Canon lenses available; these new improvements will only enhance its reputation. If I owned Canon equipment and had to choose between the Canon EF 85mm f1.2L II USM lens or its illustrious predecessor, then without question I would be willing to acquire this fine new lens 
I bought this lens as I was walking out to Africa for a month and a half safari. I didn't own a true wide angle lens and I had just spent most of my budget on a 70-200mm USM "L" lens and a 1.4x extension. I wanted to get the widest lens I could get but I didn't have the big bucks to get the 16-35L or the 14mm L so I got this lens figuring I could correct in Photoshop CS2 later. This is what I found: 1) I have a 20D and it doesn't barrel distort anywhere near as bad as I had thought it would....I imagine it distorts quite a bit more on a 5D or other full frame sensor but on the 20D, 10D, 30D, or Rebel it is not that bad. 2) It does distort enough even on the 20D that its noticable on every single inside shot and on many panoramic shots....to the experienced professional, you'd notice it even in panoramas. 3) For the computer person: I find it very easy to correct the barrel distortion in Photoshop CS2 very easily....I use a plugin (there are several on the web) 4) I tend to like the barrel distortion look on some of my pictures. Pros 1) Image Quality is superb. For not being an L lens, this lens has some amazing color, sharpness, and saturation. They spared very little in grinding this lens. Some of my best African pictures, daytime and nightime were taken with this lens and they were fabulous. 2) Build pretty well, metal mount, metal integrated hood...but not up to L standards by any means....to its credit, it survived 14 days by vibration ridden truck treking across the Kalahari desert with all its dust, mokoro canoeing in the okavango delta for over a week, hiking, elephant riding, and the five diamond resort at victoria falls (the last one was easy for the fisheye)... 3) It is a Fisheye lens and if used properly, it can create some amazing pictures and views...for example In Botswana in the Okavango, I knelt down next to a Gigantic Baobab tree and pointed it up towards the sky, The fisheye captured not only Rex the guide standing next to the tree but the entire massive trunk of the Baobab AND ALL of the canopy of the tree way above. Everything! I know of few lenses that would let me do that. It was an amazing shot only possible with a Fisheye. 4) It focuses to about 12inches. 5) f/2.8 makes it very good in low light situation. 6) The integrated hood comes complete with a nice metal cover. Cons 1) Its not built like an L: a) no USM motor so you can hear the whir as it tries to focus b) no moisture seals etc c) It does have a metal mount 2) It is a fisheye lens -- I found out after a month and a half what this meant....it doesn't stay on my camera much. I take it out when I need a certain effect or when I plan to retouch in Photoshop. It distorts visibly on a 20D and I imagine quite a bit more on a full frame. 3) Integrated Hood...can't put screw on filters...but it does have a gel filter holder. 4) No bag. My veredict: 1) I've purchased a 16-35mm Canon "L" and that lens stays in camera most of the time when I want wide-angle but when I need a special look or I really want to capture everything, I bring out my 15mm Fisheye. I won't sell it, I don't regret buying it. I learned what a specialty Fisheye lens is and its staying in my arsenal for those special shots. 2) I can't compare against non-canon lenses but I can say that Canon quality here is extraordinary. I would knock them on the construction but the lens is built well enough and the "glass" itself is spectacular so 5 stars. 3) I ordered from Amazon 3 days before my trip --- it arrived the next day. Great Service. Thx Amazon. 
For anyone who wants to make their photos different, this is the lens! With 180 degree capacity and fabulous auto focus capability, this lens takes an ordinary photo and turns it into something extraoridinary. I shoot for magazines and many of the photos that are selected for publication are taken with the lens. It's an expensive toy, but worth the money when you see the results. I highly recommend it 
Let me first start off by saying - long time canon user. I own 6 or 7 lenses, including three L series lenses, and this is by far one of my favorites - if not my absolute favorite. I shoot mostly glamour and erotica type work on a 20D. So right there, this lens is not a true 15mm for me - but 1.6x15mm. It's sharp as a tack. It's light weight. It's very short (I call it the nub lens). And it's autofocus is amazing. Very little barrel distortion... and highly recommended. This lens is probably as sharp (if not sharper) than my 24-70 2.8L or my 17-40 4.0L lens. 
First, let me cover the most important point: Does it work? Yes. The praise that most users express for this item is well merited. I purchased this because, like everyone else, normal batteries just did not last. Ten or fifteen photos in, especially if you used flash, and they'd be ready for a change; even the so-called "Heavy Duty" or those marketed as "Digital Camera" didn't make a difference. Well, both of those terms should be reserved for these power cells; they really are less like a battery and more like a power pack. On my first charge up, which took only 3 hours and 6 minutes - I timed it - I wanted to actually test how many photos one could get. On my smaller camera, a 3MP Fujifilm Finepix S3100, I got 52 photos, some with flash, most without. Not random snaps to see how many it could record, but actually taking the time to frame them, select composition, etc. The camera stayed on the entire time using the full LCD rather than viewfinder, took all photos on highest-resolution setting, transferred between auto, manual, and situational modes, charged full flash about 8 times, and went into preview mode. Three hours, 47 minutes later, I got a "low battery" warning - not depleted - low. I stopped then, sure that I had not overpaid. **Note: These power cells will likely last much longer than 3h47m. Lower resolution may result in more photos. These numbers simply represent an unscientific but strenuous personal test to see what the product would do. Other notes about the product: - All parts except for door are made of hard, impact resistant plastic. - Fold away plug in back makes charger easier to store. - Red and Green LEDs are very bright, no mistake between charge and full mode. - Has two "channels", A and B. Seems to charge sets of batteries best; this may have been an issue with another reviewer who reported issues with using one battery at a time. - Black (body back), silver (body front) and blue (door) looks nice. I have one complaint, though perhaps it's only one founded in pure puzzlement. The door flips open...to the right. When holding the unit in your hand, with the Monster logo at the top and the LED at the bottom, the door flips open to the right. My guess is that this decision was made so that the door didn't close on your hand when loading, because most people will tilt it in their left hand so that it's facing away from them at about 45 degrees; I know I do. My final review: 5 out of 5 
Monster is a little pricey, as everyone knows, but it's good stuff. This unit is attractive, works well and is nicely designed. Only one very small drawback: unless you have small pointy fingers, the first battery is a little hard to remove. I use a little plastic relay tool to lever it out, which I store right in the charger. But I stayed with 5 stars for this one 
The charger unit or the batteries (or both) don't work right: I use the batteries one at a time, in rotation to power my Zen MP3 player. Sometimes I put discharged batteries in the charger, plug it in, the light blinks red, then goes off. Only supposed to show either red (discharged, charging) or green (fully charged.) This morning 3 batteries show fully charged, I take one out, it is discharged. All these problems happened with a first unit, I returned it to Monster and after they took their sweet time, got a replacement which works just as erratically. Monster's stuff looks good, but it is the last time I am going to buy their brand 
After reading the reviews, just bought the charger. The first charge took about 3 hours, then the led turned green. I accidentally disconnected the power, when I plug it again, the led turns orange, and start charging again. Will this hurt the battery 
Compact Design....bought it since 2002.....still going strong...went to soo many trips wit me...and easily fit in ur luggage.... now i use that for my Travel only and use Powerex MH-C204 F for my daily use... can take at least 2 hours of pics wit my Minolta Z 
When I bought a digital camera, I already knew that I would need rechargeable batteries for it. What I didn't realize was how quickly the camera would eat the supplied alkalines. I had taken barely a dozen pictures before they were drained to the point where the camera would no longer operate! So I looked for a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger and quickly settled on this one because of previous experience with Monster Cable's products. It performs better than advertised. The initial charge may have taken 3 hours, but subsequent charges have been much quicker. I have yet to drain these batteries to the point where they won't operate the camera. The charger itself is an attractive unit for an appliance, and has an LED indicator that lights up red for charging and changes to green to indicate fully charged. It is compact enough to fit comfortably in the camera bag and the plug folds into the back of it. I have had good service from it and can highly recommend this charger 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
I bought one of these for my Canon SD-800 and can recommend it. For many years now, I've carried Canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the Canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose. My only criticism of the Canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media. I was hoping that with the tiny size of SD cards Canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases, but they haven't. On the plus side, the case retains the superior leather construction, uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of Velcro or a snap, and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body. The package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera. Incidentally, the SD-800 is well matched to the case, fitting quite securely 
The leather, design, craftmanship all exceed my expectation. Instead of velcro, it replaced with magnetic button, which is a plus. It also included a matching leather wrist strap with Canon logo, another plus. My Canon sd40 can also fit into nicely, although leave some room on the side 
Very impressed with the prompt service and delivery of said product. It is perfect for our new canon camera. Congratulations 
I'm the owner of Canon SD630.This case fit very good to my camera and it is very good kind of leather 
Quality leather case is great for the Canon Elph digital cameras. The only negative is that there is no place to store extra battery or memory card 
I have the cannon SD600 and i've been pleased with my carrying case, it takes a beating but protects my camera nicely. Highly recommend both the camera and this case 
I received case quickly and love it! It is a perfect fit for the sd700IS and protects it nicely. It is also a nice quality leather that looks nice as well 
I had originally bought a case from walmart but it just wasnt working out. What a difference this one made. Fits like a glove and well worth the few extra dollars this one cost in comparison to the ill fitting one. I highly recomend this for your canon sd630 Plus the service and delivery were excellent 
Excellent case, no question about it. It is stylish and well-put together. This can not be worn on a belt, though, it must go in a pocket, purse, or in your hand. The main thing is that it keeps the awesome camera safe and sound, and it looks good doing it. 
Case is pretty much what you see...I have no complaints. =) The case protects my camera very well

This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. I use this filter on my 50mm f/1.8D lens and on my 18-55mm lens. 
Just what I needed with out having to spend a fortune on a glass filter to protect my expensive Nikon Lenses. I bought one for each of my different lenses because I would rather break the filter than the glass on the lens 
This filter is an excellent cost efficient way to protect your valuable lenses. 
A basic protection item you should have. Does not appear to be multi-coated, as the more expensive Hoya filters are, but clearly worth it. Fits the Nikon 18-55mm ED perfectly and allows the Nikon lens hood to fit well 
The filter is decent. I paid only $3 with free shipping so im not expecting much out of this filter. I bought it for protection and it does that perfectly. Not the best for night shots obviously but overall a good buy 
Great product for people that want more out of their digital camera. Not so easy to operate at the beginning, but learning is quick and the results are extremely satisfying. With a little dedication, you will be able manipulate the secrets of high end photography. Best buy for the buck 
As an early adopter of digital, dating from 1999 and the Agfa ePhoto 1280 and 1680 to the current iteration of the Nikon family, I can attest that this camera is as flexible as any of my film cameras that I use for studio and location work. Fujifilm has migrated the best features of a mecanical film camera over to this model. From a hot shoe for external mounted flash and a sync terminal for off camera flash, to the cable release socket on the shutter button, Fuji has melded the best of the analog with the best of the digital. With 9 mega pixel resolution, ISO from 80 to 1600, shutter speeds from 30 seconds to 1/4000, a 1.6 inch CCD sensor, Fujinon 28 to 300 mm (135 equivalent) zoom, tilting LCD monitor (if you use those things), RAW file format support, real time histogram display, eleven shooting modes, movie recording, AF assist illuminator and full manual control when needed, Nikon, Canon, Olympus, et al have a lot of catching up to do. No need to change lenses means a sealed camera and that equates to the sensor staying spring time fresh in the body. No dust getting in every time a lens is swapped (although, I still miss all that Nikon glass). All this for less than $ 600.0 
I bought this camera based on several online reviews, including Steve's Digicams, and couldn't be more pleased. I've been using it since last Christmas (bought it as a present to myself after six months of looking at various brands and models). Aside from image quality (which it has plenty of) I insisted on at least an LCD viewfinder (EVF) as well as screen, a real filter ring (no adapters, please!) easy basic controls, long optical zoom, CF card, hot shoe and the ability to use ordinary AA batteries in a pinch. Also had to fit my hand and feel natural. This had all that, plus an actual cable release socket in the shutter button! (Thus I can easily use my cable and bulb releases, as well as a long-duration timer I have in my 35mm kit.) It also has a standard pc socket for more flash options than the built in flash or hot shoe. The heft is good, but not very heavy. You can carry it for a long time without fatigue, but it has enough mass to steady your hand, and enough size for easy gripping. I find it very instinctive to point and shoot with it. Most of the basic control locations are convenient and easily remembered. (Zoom is manual only, but that suits me. I don't like waiting for motorized zooms to get where I want, especially with a zoom range this long.) I'll leave it to the pro reviewers to discuss the image merits, but I will say that for me they seem perfectly sharp with very good color even at the default settings. In addition, I've gotten very good results shooting at night with very long exposures. (Starry sky, clouds backlit by the moon, streets under moonlight and streetlamps, etc.) Much less noise and "grain" than I've experienced with other cameras. So far it's the closest to film I've found in such situations - at any price I can afford, at least. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is bright and sharp and performs well in low light. I don't miss an optical viewfinder much at all. There's a diopter adjustment to accomodate most people's visiion. (Stops just short of enough for my worst eye - comes closer than most, though - but I find I can use the EFV with my glasses on if I want). One accessory I strongly recommend is a soft rubber, wide angle, lens shade (for a 58mm filter ring). They can be found cheap (I paid $7 at a local store) and will protect the rim of the lens when you set down the camera in addition to shading the lens. There is an included hard-plastic lens shade that clips on the outside of the lens's rim, but t's "notched" and I worry about catching it on things - I like the soft rubber ones better (they look more "pro" too). It may interfere with the supplemental illumination lamp for focussing, so you'll want to remove it when shooting close to mid-range photos in dim light 
I spent a lot of time reading reviews and posts, finally I bought it, it is the best camera I have used, I went from an old Konica 35mm film camera to a Sony Cybershot 2 mp and then to not having a camera for a while later I had a Kodak P850 (great camera also, but slow to my taste) and finally this S9000, belive me this is a great choice it is the only camera that I have found that is positivly compared to DLSR and still being a prosumer camera, that tells a lot. The lack of picture stabilization is not a big deal, it has the anti blur mode which is almost the same, and have a full array of controls and manual settings that will help and please from amateurs to not so ameteurs. It also has the first steps os face detection in it's multifocus mode, which focuses most of the times in subjects faces where ever they are on the frame (not necesary centered), I have to mention it has its limitations and you have to know how to compose your shot. The User guide is easy to read, understand and follow, you don't have to know nothing about photografy with this manul you will use most of the functions in a few hours with easy. Summary: 5 of 5!!! Nice camera 
Many of the options on this camera are mechanically on the body of the camera rather than on an internal menu so wanting a change in focusing method etc is easy! Shaking is no problem with the 10.7x optical zoom and warning icons appear if it may be a problem. Icons appear if the subject isn't focused warning you to change the focusing method. Automatic power turnoff to save batteries after two or five minutes, your choice. You can set the camera to take instant pictures; again, your choice. This camera allows you to set your options rather than have the camera go to default after power off and having to change it back to your option. That was a problem I had with my previous camera. Maybe a little pricey, but the results are great! 
(Wife of account holder)I knew before I bought this camera it was just what I needed! I am a semi-pro-am that does photography as a hobby and a job. I knew I didn't need the $5K camera we have at work, but wanted something more than my $200 point and shoot. This is it! Out of the box, it took about 15 min to take my first pic. Hardest part was threading the camera strap with the lens cap holder - a nice little detail. The main selling point for me was the "Natural Light" mode. Tried with flash and without in N mode and the quality is amazing. My little P didn't do any good in low light without flash, this camera gets an A+. A few minor notes I wanted to make before I was lovestruck: The LCD screen has no protection, just kind of out there in the open. A cover or even just that little plastic stick-on most low end cameras come with would be enough to make me feel like it isn't going to bust. The viewfinder is really just a mini-LCD screen, which I imagine does a bit of a number on the batteries, though not as much as the full size LCD on the back. The menu looks pretty extensive, but fairly easy to navigate once it becomes a little more familiar. So far, I love it, but took off one star because of the LCD issue. Maybe I can find a cover or something for it to help me feel better about it. Other than that, I can already tell this camera will do everything I need to take great pics and get creative with some manual settings and exposure manipulation. Love that it takes xD and CF cards - and both can be in the camera at the same time! Save movies to one, pics to the other! It feels pretty solid, and takes super inexpensive AA batteries - another selling point for me, as were the hot shoe and sync capabilities. If you are looking to go SLR, but can't fork out the dough, this is a perfect alternative. (Though check around for price - with [...] rebate, I got mine for less than [...]!! 
Good price for a 9MP camera with 10x zoom. Image quality is good. I'm still shooting mainly on the 3MP and 5MP with good results. The spot metering works really well, especially while shooting on a bright day with the objects sitting under an umbrella. The Macro works nicely. I still yet to find a good use for the Super Macro. The camera recycles between shots pretty quick. The anti-blur mode (using higher ISO rate) works well. Controls/menu make sense. Although I wish the memory switch feature is not buried too deep in the menu. That's another good feature. You can have 2 memory cards in the camera and with the xD being so cheap. You can combined the capacity instead of having to buy a bigger and more expensive card. I especially like how the menu is displayed even inside the viewfinder (it's an exact copy of the LCD). That way, I don't have to take my eyes off of my object while cycling through the menu. I wish the battery life could be better. In effort to conserve battery power, I shoot mainly using the viewfinder and avoid using the flash by using the anti-blur mode. But on the bright side, one can just carry more high-capacity, rechargeable AA's. It just takes a while to get used to the battery consumption rate. I carry a 2 sets of backups where the third one is Alkaline 
I paid $225 out the door for this camera and it competes with cameras almost twice that price! On the automatic setting, it takes incredible photos, but has the capability to go manual if you are so inclined. For the price, there is nothing on the market that comes close. The macro on this camera is great and the close ups I have taken even on the automatic setting are unbelievable. If you are looking for something that is SLR like, but not the SLR price, this comes close. Of course, the SLR's will take better photos if you are an expert, but if you are an amateur or intermediate photographer and want something that gets the job done, put this one on your list...taking the price into consideration this thing doesnt disappoint. You will be glad you purchased this one! 
I am pleased with this camera. Its pretty easy to use. I have virtually no camera experience, save for breaking them. This camera is easy to operate and is pretty fun to fool around with. I have used the aperture setting several times to get different focus points on the pics. The instructions were easy to comprehend. I have taken quite a bit of Sports photos and I have noticed its extremely difficult to get shots inside a gymnasium. The shots are usually very blurry and the color just isn't right most of the time. Fluorescent modes on the camera are helpful, but do not fix the problem. It could just be me though 
i like this camera very much is easy to use and gets good result 
Reviewed most digital cameras on the market today to replace a worn Olympus. Decided that this camera fitted my needs even though I had never purchased a Fuji camera before. I bought it before I made a two-week vacation to Greece. WOW. I was stunned by the quality of my pictures. Colors were unbelievably true to nature. I love to take low level lighting pictures like at sunset, sunrise, etc. I couldn't believe the outcome. It gave me some of the most beautiful shots I have ever made with high priced film cameras. And I did this on automatic. No more worries about f stops, speed, etc. for me 
I gave this to my wife for her birthday, and so far no complaints at all. The camera has plenty of functions that you can play with, but it can also work in point and shoot situations. Good quality pictures, and it looks and feels top notch 
I'm using it for a few months now; I haven't found a single problem so far. Earlier, I was using an old FinePix and the optic/sensor sensitivity was not very good; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment. This is not a problem any more. Also, I was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom. In general, I was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out :-). Sure, there are better cameras on the market; however, considering the price it is just a great deal 
I went from taking the camera out of its packing to taking professional quality pictures in twenty minutes. It's amazing 
These cameras are as simple to use as any I have ever seen and the quality of the pictures are as good or better than cameras costing 3 times as much. Great Buy 
The quality is definitely great. When attached to the S3 IS, it makes your camera look serious about taking good shots. If you are attaching the hood and doing flash photography, I suggest you use a slave flash to eliminate the shadow caused by the hood 
The black color of the adapter and hood are a nice match for the gunmetal finish of the S3. The fit is good and they do what they are supposed to. I noticed that the hood tends to "lock" to the adapter if you accidently squeeze it when unscrewing it -- probably because the plastic bends a little. Use a lighter touch and it unscrews right off. The one off-putting thing to me is the price of these two inexpensive pieces of plastic. I know they may be precision-engineered plastic with a nice finish, but please, over 15 dollars each for the two pieces? They're plastic! I know corporations supposedly owe it to stockholders to maximize profits, but perhaps these could have been included with S2/S3 as standard equipment. Or sold for a price more in line with the construction material 
I purchased this for my S2 IS instead of a third-party adapter. The only issue I have is that it's black instead of silver (doesn't match the camera). I also had to make sure I purchased the correct camera bag to hold the camera with the lens adapter attached 
Very important to shade the camera lenses and avoid flairs. It doesn't fit in the carrier bag designed for Canon S2, S3, though, which is a big time bummer. However, I would recommend it anyways, because the quality of the pictures and the protection of your lenses are worth carrying a different bag for the rest of your stuff 
It is a great camera. It has a small size, good optical zoom and Excellent quality. I love it too much and I take it anywhere and carrying it in it's Nikon small case 
I bought this camera because of the small size, megapixles and zoom + digital zoom. I wanted something to take outdoors into the wilderness and not worry about hurting it. Price wise I feel this camera offers pleanty of featrues at a very reasonable price 
What a wonderful camera. The photos come out sharp and clear. The small size makes it very handy to carry around with you at all times. The photos load very quickly on to the computer. For the price I would rate this a "best buy". I found only one drawback which I feel is minor. In very bright sunlight it is difficult to see the object on the screen unless it is shaded by a hand or a piece of paper or cardboard. But this minor problem would not stop me from purchasing a second Coolpix L4. You can purchase a 512 or l Meg memory card for very little money. Check Amazon for Kingston or SanDisk. I have both and they are great. 
I am not a photographer, but the pictures I take look great. It feels great to know that I can capture memories in vivid color too. (that's the setting I always use.) On the other hand though, there is a long wait time to use the camera again after a picture was taken using the camera flash. I don't quite know why but it seems that if you have to take many pictures in quick succession then using the cameras's flash is not the best way to go! All in all, for the price i paid the quality is quite suitable. If you don't have any experience in photography, buy this one 
This is an excellent pocket camera and it lives up to the Nikon reputation for quality. While it lacks some controls seen on more sophisticated models the pictures will please the most demanding for this class camera. I liked it so well I bought two, one for myself and one as a gift to a budding photographer 
I simply love this camera, it's very tiny in size and takes great pictures and you can buy rechargable batteries or regular batteries if you should choose. it is simple to use, didn't even have to read the manuel. for a starter camera or advance user, get this one, you will love it !!! 
The Coolpix L4 is a great camara. Love the night modes, portrait. Takes great pictures, took it on our honeymoon, and all pictures came out great. It also takes very good movies, I thought it wouldn't and that is why I didn't go for the one with speaker, but seeing the cuality of both pictures and video, I should have gone for the one with mic, that's the L3 
This camera is worth every penny. I just recieved it today and so far I like it a lot. Seems to be well made, has a nice size LCD screen, and takes good pictures from what I have seen so far. Battery life seems good. It has 15 scene modes which you would not expect with a camera in it's price range. Macro mode is excellent! The only downsides really is the time it takes from when you take a picture to the time you can take the next, it takes a second for the flash to charge. The camera only comes with 10mb internal memory, so unless you are going to invest in a bigger memory card, you will only be able to take about 6 pictures. The video mode is good, but does not have any sound. Overall I give it a 4.5. Price paid: $11 
I use my Canon 10d mainly for Astrophotography. Most of the time, it involves keeping the camera shutter open for long periods of time, anywhere from a few minutes to tens of minutes. This ACK-E2 adapter takes my worries away from monitoring battery status or a drained one, while i control the camera remotely sitting inside my house. Continuous power also ensures worry free writes to its flash storage. The package included several AC power connectors which is very useful while travelling. Amazon provides a wide range of items to choose from. 
If your camera spends any amount of time connected to your computer--either copying pictures, or using the remote capture program--you should have this AC adapter. It is also obviously handy to have if you do a lot of shooting from a fixed location--for instance: a tripod. The adaptor is an ingenious little contraption. There is the normal AC line that runs to the power adapter, but instead of running the DC output to a dedicated jack on the camera body, the connector is in the shape of the normal battery pack. If you look closely at your camera, you will see a little grove at the bottom of the battery compartment providing enough room for a wire to exit. Now for the surprise. I'm planning a trip to Europe. I knew the battery charger that came with the camera, and this AC adapter both support 100-240 volts AC, 50-60 Hz input. Which covers all the worlds power supplies. But the battery charger included with the camera only came with the US power cord. I've been looking for various European cords that would fit the charger so I could keep my batteries topped off overseas. What should I find when I open the box to this adaptor? A complete collection of all the worlds cords, which also happen to fit the charger. What a win, now I can run my camera on AC, and stay charged while I'm on vacation 
Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shaped one and three quarters inch long offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Being so shallow and petal shaped, even this type of protection is limited. Even if the protection is limited, replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing an expensive L lens. This hood is manufactured for the Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L EF and normally comes included with the lens when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. This lens isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem. While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. PROS: Improves contrast and image quality Reduces lens flare problems Offers limited protection to the lens CONS: Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens 
Pros: - Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element. - Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile 
I'm using this hood for the Canon EF-S 10-22mm lens on a 20D. It's a bit shocking how big this hood is until you realize it's really necessary for the very wide field of view. On the Canon 20D, the lens is equivalent to the EF 16-35mm f2.8, only it's f3.5-4.5. Bottom line is that it does the trick and is made to the same good quality as the rest of Canon's stuff 
Using either on EF 16-35mm lenses or EF-S 10-22mm lenses (on 20D or Rebel bodies with 1.6x crop factor) this hood helps to eliminate (I mean reduce a lot) the flare on sunny days or certain lightning conditions..... highly recommended for those who like to shot at the lower end (16mm) of these lenses. 
This is a fabulous and reliable camera. Feels solid. Fantastic pictures. Easy to operate. A new D40 has been announced over the past few days, but its lack of an LCD display and buttons to manage basic camera controls (to reduce weight and make it more user friendly) would still make this my recommended Nikon DSLR. Expect prices to fall as the D40 becomes available 
I am not a photographer, but I enjoy taking good pictures. I never had a digital SLR before; the camera I had before the D50 was a Nikon Coolpix (a compact one). I thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro. I realized that it was even better than what I expected (maybe because I was coming from a Nikon Coolpix). The colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good. The D50 is among the cheapest digital SLR's, and, at the same time, it is a very serious product. I don't think the D50 is much inferior to the Canon Rebel, even if the Canon has 2 more megapixels of resolution. I used both the D50 (which I own) and the Rebel (at my school) and I think the D50 feels much more like a "pro camera" when you hold it in your hands, while the Rebel feels more like a toy. The lenses provided in the package are good, but are basic. According to me the 18-55 is better than the 28-80, but I think I should have bought the 55-200 as well: 18 to 200 covers most of the pictures that you can take. Also the 18-135 that Nikon sells with the D80 looks good to me, but they don't make a kit with those lenses for the D50. The last thing that really amazes me is the .NEF format (Nikon's RAW format). It is impressive how quickly you can improve a .NEF picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse. If you want a good camera, and you don't want to spend too much money for it I think this is the best choice 
As an amatuer photographer this gives me the what I need at a price I can afford. It has many features that I am still learning how to use. The difference between the pictures that the D50 takes as a DSLR compared to cheap digital camera is like night and day. I am really happy with this camera and the lens combination I purchased. I can do anything from a macro of a spider to a zoom-in of a squirrel sitting in a tree. The battery has a good life span and I rarely have to change it for my spare while shooting. Remember to puchase seperately your memory card as it is not part of the purchase. I'd recommend at least a 2GB card, which can also be purchased at amazon. I was able to catch a squirrel jumping between trees because of the number of frames you can take each second. It is also so easy to take photos indoors without using flash and being obtrusive during the event you are photographing. I also recommend purchasing 52mm lens filters, to keep your nikkor lenses free of fingerprints, etc. 
Nikon D50 is an absolutely fantastic camera. If you are moving from point and Shoot, you will jump to a completely new leage of photography. Pros: 1. Noise extremely low at ISO 800, and highly usable at 1600. 2. Camera control is good, you get 2.5 frame per second, more than enough for non-professionals. 3. Flash sync is 1/500 sec, one of the best in market. 4. Image quality (IQ) is excellent. Cons: 1. LCD screen is small. 2. Top LCD has no back light. 3. No depth of field review button. Regards, csoura 
I felt the price was very competitive and it was received within the time frame the seller told me it would be. The camera is very easy to handle and has so far taken wonderful shots. It was just what I was hoping it would be 
As a long time film person, I really wanted to find a digital slr that could surpase the feel and quality of film without the guess. other digital cameras were basically point and shoot versions. with two children in athletics year round, the d50 does it all. we've shot over 3000 pictures in the past three months just of soccer and softball. the nikon software makes converting and storing a breeze. the only thing missing was a protector for the viewfinder, it's standard on the d70 and now the d80. there is an aftermarket available that does fine in that dept. I have recommended the d70 to so many people that nikon must put me on their marketing team 
The Nikon D50 is my fourth digital camera, and my first SLR camera. I don't know why I didn't try SLR earlier, but now I have decided that I will never go back to non-SLR cameras (well, I still have my other 3 point and shoot digital cameras which sometime is more convenient to carry.) I guess I'm just trying to show how much I like the SLR camera. Now back about the D50. Unless you are shooting sports/actions professionaly (which then you will want to buy the D2H or D2X for faster focusing processor, faster frames per second and larger memory buffer), the D50 is pretty much all you will need (equipped with several lenses of course). The D50 has all the pre-configured settings for the casual photographers ("child" mode is also added for the D50, night landscape mode is not available), and it has the usual P,S,A,M mode for the more serious/advance photographer. I have stopped using the pre-set mode now and strictly uses the aperture priority and the shutter priority mode (as far as the manual mode, I'm not there yet). This shows that this camera is versatile and suitable for all ranges of skills. Comparing with its siblings (D70s, D80, D200), I think whichever you want to buy is fine. They are all great cameras. It comes down to your budget. And comparing to other brand like the canon (Rebel XT or the 30D),or pentax or sony, it will be just brand preference (and what lenses that you already have). Moreover, If you come from a point and shoot camera user, any SLR brand you buy I don't think you will be dissapointed (just the fact that SLR performs better in most important aspect of photography) Image quality of the D50 is good which is #1 factor that I look for in a digital camera. Here are the pros and cons of the D50 in my opinion: Pros: 1. Nice out of the camera result picture quality (on Auto setting, and pre-programmed setting) 2. Fit perfectly on my hand (grip nicely) 3. Instant on and can take picture right away 4. 2.5 frames per second 5. large 2 inch LCD 6. Battery life (will take 400-2000 shots on a single charge depend on how often you use the full power flash) 7. Uses SD card 8. Fast USB2 connection 9. capability to copy and re-size pictures to small size (great for email) 10. repeating #1 again. Great image quality Cons (which are mostly minor): 1. No backlight on top panel 2. No Black and White picture mode 3. No night landscape mode 4. No ISO 100 (and on ISO 1600 the picture is grainy though still usable) 5. No depth-of-field preview button 6. No front command dial 7. 1/4000 max shutter speed I started using this camera for landscape and portrait, but later on I started shooting sports/action and night (low light) settings, hence I added the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 AF-D which is a great prime lens and I'm recommending to everyone to get this "fast" lens. I'm also recommending you to get the Nikon 70-300M f/4-5.6 AF G, which is a nice (for the price) zoom lens. If you have the budget then go for the Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 VR AF-S which I think the best zoom lens that nikon currently have. (The VR really works especially for stationary object. If the object you want to photograph is moving and in low light situation/indoor then you will need a "fast" lens, i.e. lens with large aperture such as f/2.8, f/1.8, or f/1.4 etc) Happy Photographing! 
I am very happy with this camera. It takes very good photos in automatic mode, but all the extra features make you want to learn how to take amazing photos. Also, I have big hands so the camera feels a lot nicer in my hands than the Canon Digital Rebel XT. The only improvements I would make to the camera are: 1 - I am a big guy so the strap doesn't seem to be quite long enough. Eventually I'll pick up a new one. 2 - The battery charger setup is very bulky. I'm not quite sure why they chose to put a 5 foot electric cable onto the charger instead of making it plug directly into the outlet. 3 - After being used to the Canon camera software, the Nikon preview mode zoom feature seems cumbersome. Otherwise this camera is great. I'm looking forward to learning more and picking up another lense 
My first digicam, bought it 2 years ago. Simple to use, great pictures, and a year ago (and hundreds of pictures ago) I dropped it (no in its case) on a cobblestone road - no damage. Have never seen the need to replace it. I like the common batteries it uses and the SD memory 
I've had my Canon A510 for over a year and I still love it. I've taken it on vacation with me several times, including one trip to Yellowstone Park, where I took about 1000 pictures. It's great. It's small and light and I like the way it fits my hand. It's fast. I never have to spend time waiting on it. It takes great pictures! It uses 2 batteries and the batteries last longer than my last camera lasted using 4. The only problem I've had is that occassionally the lens cover will stick and not completely open. I can just barely touch it with my finger and it unsticks and opens the rest of the way so that's not a major issue 
My mom I have each have one of these cameras. Neither, one of us has had any problems until recently. I dropped mine while taking pictures with the timer. The drop on my tile floor smashed the telescoping lens out of alignment and wouldn't close and gave a E8 error on the screen. I contacted the canon US website then, I sent it into the canon repair center in IL. It cost $87 to have it repaired and shipped back. It took about a week and a half to have it returned to me. The only thing I would improve about this camera is the speed, I had trouble taking pictures of my son on the merry go round(but it could be that I need to change settings). It has many features on it and accessories to add on. Since, I am learning more about digital photography this is a great little starter camera to have with many features that canon is known for. Also recently I've been looking at some of the newer canon models, their casing/ bodies look/feel really cheap to me. It may make them lighter but it makes me really afraid that I would break them 
I've had the A510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2M camera. After six months the lens and cover have jammed and I noticed that many Amazon reviewers have had the same issue. One evening I took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate. I'm hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers. 
I own this hood and Canon Digital Rebel XT. I like the hood. It works well limiting stray light as well as protecting the lens. As you will hear from many experienced photographers (I'm an amateur), they would never shoot pictures without the hood on the lens so why would you? All hoods are expensive for what they are, a piece of plastic, but they serve a necessary function. Get the hood if you want the best from your lenses, including this lens the 50mm f1.8 II. I would give it 5 stars but it is pricey 
It works great with my EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens. The price of this hood with ring seems pricy compare to the lens price, but it does the job when it's really needed. 
My existing battery aged and I started to look forward a replacement. After I read several reviews, I preferred to choose the original one, because of heating and performance problems. Therefore, I found a good bundle price If I'd selected the cord, battery and case for my sd100 camera. By the way, I did not have a good case as this new one. I rated 4 stars, because I preferred to stay with the original cord 
It would cost you more to buy these separately. The battery alone could cost this much. The rest of the accessories have come in handy. I originally wanted this only for the battery, but now, I have options. Great value. Buy it 
I am am very happy with this package. The only issue, the thick stainless steel neck strap. I had no use for it and I have never seen anyone using it. I would prefer to have another extra battery or have the existing battery be an extended life one. Overall, for the price you cannot get a leather case and battery combo from somewhere else for the same price at Amazon. I consider the neck strap an unnecessary component as the one that comes with the camera is lighter and more flexible. it is also more elegant. 
If you've bought the Sd550, this is a great addition, the case has saved my camera a couple of times already from scratches and dings (especially with little kids around), the extra camera chord is long and durable (coated metal link chain) and the extra battery of course is invaluable. I'd give it 5 stars, if I didn't feel that these items should come standard with the camera. : 
After researching numerous websites looking for a Canon fitted case for my new camera, I again turned to Amazon and found just what I was looking for at the lowest price. The leather case fits well and isn't bulky, just protective. Now I don't have to worry about damaging the camera by dumping it in my purse with everything else so it can always be handy for impromptu shots. The neat, comfortable neck strap was just an added bonus 
I rated accessory kit 3 as well. Gave Kit 3 a 3 star. I gave kit 2 to my mom who just got a SD550. Great camera from what I can tell. This kit however needs major improvements. Going from the best about kit 2, to the worst about it, we will be starting with a review of the battery pack. Battery... Uhhh, not much to say here. Spare battery that to use as a hot spare out there if your running low after taking too many shots. Mine from kit 3 is great and I still use it to this day. I swap the active battery each time I charge. This is what gave this product as many stars as I have given it. Final decision (Battery): WONDERFUL Neck Strap... (Taken from Kit 3 and added improvements) If your moving around this thing is WAY to long or way to short. It's too short to strap across you chest. It's way to long because if it hangs in front of you, your precious camera you just paid a couple to a few hundred for is now freely bouncing around. NOT good. My mom is really short and this is just too short for her to use as well. Not as much of a bouncing issue as me but still not useful enough for her. Her comment was, "This strap is either too short or too long. Doesn't fit me at all." Cracks me up because I never told her my personal opinion of the matter and she came up with the same results. Final Decision (Neck Strap): use it for a jump drive that you use often or anything else. Just not your precious camera. Case... They screwed up on Kit 3, and this kit is still screwed up (managed to be even worse than kit 3). Velcro is fine for most usage so I can't knock that. Belt clip is fine and dandy. Case is pretty darn good at keeping the camera safe from outside elements and harm. Hole in center is useless as heck just like kit 3 (mom came to same conclusion). Here's where they REALLY screwed up. Stitching in this case is worse than kit 3. In kit 3, you only had to worry about stitching screwing up your screen in the back of the case. In this case, you have stiching in the back AND the front. Unlike kit 3 which had a magnetic clasp where the stitching or any attachment to the case was hidden behind a soft cloth, this one is velcro and the stitching for that is on the inside front. The belt clasp has stiching on the other side. No escape in this kit. I HIGHLY advise for you to get a screen protector if using this case. Poor design and shame on the people who manufacture this case. Final Decision (Case): "Move along people... nothing to see here." Seriously... don't bother using this case without a screen protector. COMPLETE DECISION: I wouldn't buy this kit again at all. It's great that there's an extra battery but I don't think anything else is worth a penny more in this kit. Better off buying everything seprate. Going to lower my rating to 2 stars 
I've had my D2H for 9 months now. I've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it..skin tones on my unit are great. It seems this issue plagued a minority of users. Camera is very fast, exposes well and delivers results. It's primarily designed to be a sports and Photojournalism camera -- for situations where speed counts. It's a 4 megapixel wonder -- it's true it only has 4 megapixels, but they are 4 GREAT megapixels. Images upsize wonderfully. I love my unit, and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup, or wait for the D2X. The price of the D2x is making that decision a bit easier and I'm leaning toward another D2H. 
I ordered this camera in December, have had it since then, and it an amazing camera. First time I have ever had professional camera, and it takes time to learn how to use it. It is not a point and shoot camera. If you want large pictures and like to crop, this may not be the camera for you. However if you want the ability to take great pictures, and learn how to use a professional camera at a great price this is the one to buy. Ability to have custom curves, which means to have predetermined parameters for different conditions. Ability to chage ISO at random for different conditions. You can pay five thousand dollars for its successor, the Dx2, however for $2000 this is a bargin that you will never find again. Jim Comfor 
I bought the battery grip, based on the fact that my Rebel XT is a small camera, when using it at my last model shoot, someone mentioned it looked like a ï¿½tourist cameraï¿½which is pretty depressing, since adding the grip not only do I have more than enough battery life to my camera , it also has that pro look that people recognize, and even though I still believe that it's not the camera, it's the eye behind it that counts, having a good looking camera is always welcome 
I tried this product out at local camera store before I was sold on the idea. The two main things I was concerned about were how does it attach and does it add too much weight to the camera. The attaching to the camera was a little concerning, I was worried that it may damage the camera. But, after watching the guy at our local camera shop put one on a Rebel I was sold. Basically you remove the door to the battery compartment. Which comes off a lot easier than I anticipated. The grip slides in like a battery and you screw it on the bottom of the camera. Don't worry their is another hole on the bottom of the grip for the tripod. The grip does add weight but its not that significant and I noticed it adds a lot of stability while holding it. Since the grip adds height to the camera its easier to hold the camera in one hand. Much like holding one of the more expensive models. It also adds battery life since the grip holds two batteries. If you hold the new grip to take pictures with the camera on its side. You will be pleasantly surprised to see a duplicate set of buttons and the scroll wheel added on the new grip just for that purpose. It is now a permanent attachment and I am glad I decided to buy it. The buttons work just as well as the camera even at 3fps. Another note is that the quality of the Canon grip is much better than the cheaper version. 
Don't be mislead, this is an ab-so-lu-te-ly great product REGARDLESS if you have big or small hands. And it fits the new Rebel XTi (400D) too!! My hands are small, but before the BG-E3 grip I had no real use for the fifth and fourth fingers (except tucking them underneath the XT's small body.) With the BG-E3, the hand grip is firm and the whole hand grabs the camera. This gives you an extra feeling of pleasing assurance, not an unnecessary sensation. Better still, the front panel of the BG-E3 is rubberized so the bottom half of your hand won't slip away (Canon should have covered the camera's own grip with that material instead of using the average plastic that makes the body mould.) Having a little extra weight is NOT a problem, rather it always comes handy as a counterbalance for you zoom lenses (say in the 300mm range). In short, this accessory gives the Rebel camera user a welcome feeling of overall control and the sensation of having a more professional gear in your hand. The extra slot for a second battery, of course is a plus. I'm selling my XT as soon as the new XTi is available, and it's nice to know the investment I made not long ago with this Grip, will prove to be useful when I switch. Now, if only the future 40D (who knows) were to have the same compatibility... 
I bought this for a trip and not only did it fit my purpose but it makes the camera look even cooler than it already looks. I had several people stop me and ask me what it was so I got a chance to explain how it benefited me 
I've used a battery grip on almost every Canon camera I've owned since 1980. This Rebal XT battery life seems to be almost forever and with the battery grip, that gets doubled. The grip also allows you to use regular batteries so you could use them should the rechargables ever die on you and need to keep shooting. It adds another shutter release button for turning the camera 90 degrees. Larger hands would probably find the camera more comfortable with more grip area. It adds more mass which can be a pro (a little more stability) or a con (heavier to carry around). It would have been nice if Canon could have slightly remolded it to stand the camera up. As it is, the camera will lean forward on it lense. Bottom Line: I'm glad I purchased but think it could have been much cheaper. When you consider (way back when) these types of devices added a motor winder (standard on modern film SLRs and not used on digital cameras) along with added battery capacity. All this adds is additonal battery capacity. The price is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Of course most businesses don't care as long as people are buying. Mark 
A neccesary add to the Cannon Rebel. A Good product. Too bad it doesn't come with the camera 
I took the plunge and bought the BG-E3 Battery Grip from Canon. After reading the reviews of the off-brand model and deciding that I didn't want any 'button' problems, I got the Canon. I'm VERY happy with it, (not from the standpoint of having the extra battery capacity because I have 2 batteries at all times anyway) but because I like the 'look and feel' of having the additional weight and fit for my large male hands. I felt that without it, I might drop the camera at any time and while it's safely suspended about my neck, I don't like that feeling. I also like being able to spin the camera for portrait or landscape shots very quickly and cleanly and having that extra set of buttons available to change the Tv and Av settings for various effects. I got some exceptionally nice photos of a waterfall and this made it easy to use. If you're thinking about buying it, it's worth every hard-earned penny and should significantly enhance both professional and amateur uses 
If you're serious about photography, get this accessory. With the second battery, I get plenty of juice for any event (even with my zoom lens using Image Stabilization). Gives a solid grip for taking vertical (portrait) pictures while still having access to the controls you need. I can't imagine being without it now (in spite of the additional weight). 
I had no investment in a DSLR but narrowed my choices to the Canon 30D and the Nikon D200. I had always wanted a Nikon. The D200 is definitely a joy to hold and it did take good pictures (I tried both at a camera store before I bought the 30D). I did a lot of research (more than I care to admit!) and there was no conclusive evidence that one camera had a clear edge over the other. Depending on your specific needs, one camera may be "slightly better" than the other. After trying out both cameras, I was convinced the 30D was as good a fit for my needs as the D200. For "value for money" the 30D was a clear winner over the D200 (I got mine when Canon had the Cash in with Canon promotion going). Also, as a beginner to SLR I found the 30D with its fully automatic and scene modes easy to start out with. I don't expect to use the scene modes or the full auto mode after a week or two. I expect to quickly graduate to the creative control zones. But to use as a family camera, the quick scene modes are very helpful. If you expect to use it more on a professional basis it'd probably not matter. Additionally, when I checked it out at the store, I noticed the Canon 30D focused sharply almost every time. The D200 did not at least a few times. I'd take this with a grain of salt though since it was a brief trial at a store. But I thought I'd share my experience. It may have just been an anomaly with the actual equipment I tried out. Do I still find the Nikon D200 to be a great camera? Absolutely! Do I regret having bought a Canon 30D? Absolutely not! The decision swinger in my case was really the "money factor". I was more than willing to spend up to $300 more for the Nikon D200. But when the difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable for my Christmas gift to myself:-) My purchases included the Canon 30D [...], Canon 17-85mm EF-S IS USM lens [...], and a SanDisk Extreme III 2GB compact flash card [...] I plan to add an external flash to this soon, and will consider eventual lenses after I determine that the camera is a long-term keeper. 
I compared a number of pro-sumer cameras and became firmly convinced this was the best camera for the money. Although Nikon at one time was considered the premier camera for the professional, they now take second stage to Canon not only for engineering, but for the quality of the lens, innovative and user-friendly design, and overall quality. I have used the camera for approximately one month and have been delighted. Having talken pictures for over 35 years - including professional - and always using Minolta equipment for all of those years, I am truly enamored with this Canon camera 
I am so pleased with this camera! There's really nothing negative I can think to say about it! I also own the Cannon XT. I use both for wedding photography as well as family portraits and I am so impressed with the color quality of the D30! Well done CANNON 
This camera is incredible. I ordered it for my husbands birthday and he is just begining to figure it all out. There are so many great features. One of the best is how quickly you can take digital pictures. Our other digital cameras have a lag time between shots, but not this one. The pictures are crisp and it is easy for even a novice like me to use. I highly recommend this camera if you want to take digital photography to the next level. It is one of the best 
I have had my Canon Eos 30D for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations I am completely addicted to photography. I bought the 17-85mm Canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in RAW. I also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound. I bought the Camera through Dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there! Strongly recommend. Pay the extra $$$ and get this over the Rebel XTI. You won't be disappointed 
For those who truly know digital cameras, having more than perhaps 8 megapixels is important only if you plan on blowing your images up to "poster size", or if you are a pro who knows how to use all those pixels. And truthfully, how many of you really plan to do that type of stuff? To say that the Rebel XTi is better than the 30D because it "has more megapixels" and is "smaller" is not the best advice. Any Canon DSLR is going to give you great images, if know how to use it. For those of you who are trying to decide which camera to buy, you really need to go to a camera store and ask to handle each camera. While you're at it, ask yourself how it feels in your hands. Is it too bulky? Is it too small and hard to handle? Does it have the features you want such as spot metering, which the Rebel XTi does not have? The 30D is a terrific DSLR. It has all the features 99% of us need. There is a reason why it costs more than the Rebel. The 30D is a better camera overall. 
This was a great purchase at $150. I bought it to shoot amateur pictures of family at youth football games. The images are sharp across the football field on a sunny day, I use the Canon monopod and recommend it. It's 75-300mm so I have to switch out lenses to take pictures of people standing close to me. There was a 28-200mm lens but it was much more expensive and I like having the extra zoom 
This lens works very well for two amateur photographers like my wife and I. We take photos of our kids in their sports activities. Even though the lens is a little on the heavy side and feels like we are shaking a little when we snap a picture, none of our shots have come out blurry. I am pleasantly surprised by this. We feel it was well worth the price we paid.(under $100 
This lens is a wonderful starter lens. A professional might want a little upgrade, but this is just right for someone starting out. 
The Canon EF 75-300mm is a Excellent product, I own the expensive USM version and this lense doesn't have nothing to be jealous about it, it's speed to focus is excellent,the main reason i bougth it is for my wildlife photography while kayaking, I wouln't take the USM version on my kayak, to expensive to get it wet, they both perform excellent, but the cheap price of this lense make it affordable and risk proof for your pocket, it's a little noisy but nothing that will affect it's use, plus it is a intimidating peace of equipment, that will make any person think you are a professional photographe 
A exceptional portrait lens for both digital and film, the Nikkor 85mm f/1.8D is usably sharp wide open and tack sharp by the time you stop down even just a bit. Relatively small and very light, it feels just right in my hand. Steve McCurry is one of my favorite photographers and I was happy to discover that many of his great shots were taken with this lens. Also, if you shoot on a manual focus body like the F3, you'll like the solid but smooth feel of the focus ring. The 85mm comes with a metal, screw-on hood. My preference is the plastic bayonet mounts, but I find that I don't need the hood that often since this lens doesn't tend to flare. Two minor complaints about this lens: first, the bokeh is not exceptional. That's OK; I'm not a bokeh hound. But when I see the creamy out of focus specular highlights that the 85mm f/1.4 produces, sometimes I dream about spending the extra money. Second, I wish it were AF-S. But even without AF-S, it focuses faster than you'd expect. Finally, the construction is solid. I've used it heavily for two years in deserts, jungles, and glaciers (ok, and in less glamorous places like around the apartment) and it still looks brand new. In short, my favorite lens. Absolutely worth every penny 
I bought this lens when I purchased my Nikon D70s in February. I have to admit I have not used it too much. However, when I have used it, I am pleased with the results. Mostly, as I have been walking around town practicing taking photos, I have little use for the 85mm, because it's not good for "point-and-shoot" scenes. When I have taken portrait shots, however, the 85mm is very clear and creates great depth of field, which I find important. I hope this was helpful 
I have a D200 and while all the hype is around the 18-200 and others, this is one awesome lens for portraits and other closer up type photos. I read a few things that I had to research and thought I'd pass on my experience: - How is this with a D200? (ans: great. fast auto-focus. no compatibility issues) - Do you really get crisp photos and cool bokeh? (ans: absolutely) - Is 1.8 ok or do you need 1.4? (ans: I don't have a 1.4 but the 1.8 is so competent for the price and I get the crispness and shallow DOF I was looking for) - Is the shooting distance for an 85mm acceptable or do you need a 55mm so you can be closer to the subject? (ans: I really like the shooting distance for the 85mm. I really would not less distance between me and the subject) Enjoy 
If you don't need the speed or can't afford the expensive 85mm f1.4 Nikkor lens or both, then this lens may be the right one for you. It took Nikon a while to produce a superb compact 85mm lens, but this time they finally got it right. Without a doubt, this is a fine portrait lens for photographing head-and-shoulder portraits (The only lens which is optically better is Nikon's legendary 105mm f2.5 Nikkor lens, and its close optical twin, the 105mm f2.8 Micro Nikkor.). Since the 105mm f2.5 Nikkor lens doesn't have an autofocus version, then this might be the perfect moderate telephoto lens for owners of Nikon autofocus SLR cameras. Regardless, this lens has a well-earned reputation for excellent contrast and resolution 
It's very sharp lens. You will be wised to use it extensively on little children, they have such clear faces. Be careful when you use this lens with middle age women. It could show imperfecton in thousand fold. Again very sharp, very fast Af focusing on my Nikon F80. Ecxelent portrature lens, but be careful-women will hate you for unflattering portrature. My advise use black and white film-you will see less imperfection in prints with the same rasor sharp focus 
The battery charger is original equipment. I have used it for Canon Batteries and two different no name batteries rated as NB2L. All charged properly and were useable in my Canon ZR500. The charger is small and easy to travel with making it unnecessary to cary large quantities of batteries 
This is original equipment battery charger manufactered by Canon. The performance of the charger is excellent as are most Canon products. The price paid was comparible to non-sale priced items puchased via internet sites. The item was recieved in original packaging, 3 days after placing the order, was new (not reconditioned with a new appearance). I am extremely pleased with the entire purchase process experienced, from the information given at the site to ease of ordering and fast shipping 
Could not be any simpler to use. Have used it a few times since it arrived and it works flawlessly. +++ Recommended for all users. Quicker and easier than the built in charger in the ZR700 camcorder 
Slightly smaller than the charger that comes with the S(40,45,50,...) series cameras and the digital rebel series cameras. Seems to charge in about the same time. Feels a bit more substantial, but that's not saying much as the chargers that come with those cameras seem pretty flimsy. I can't give it 5 stars because it does nothing more than the chargers that come with the cameras (which I lost) 
I bought this lens to go with my Canon Digital Rebel XT. I absolutely love this lens. I got it to try some insect and other macro shots and it has served this purpose very well. With some practice this lens will produce fantastic macros with some great bokeh to boot. I read the other reviews and must say that I have never scared an insect away with the noise as mentioned before. And I have taken countless insect shots with this lens. It is a bit louder than the other lenses I have but I don't see it to be a problem. The one problem I do encounter is when using the autofocus in a busy closeup scene it often will focus on the background instead of say a closer insect on a flower. When this happens I just flip it to manual and focus that way. No big deal. Overall, great lens for an even greater price. Definitely worth it. (I submitted a photo of a bee that I took a couple of days ago with this lens as an example.) 
I purchased this lens back in March of 2005 to shoot static "Warhammer models" with my 10D. I found that longer lenses such as the Sigma 105mm, the Canon EF 100mm, and the Tamron SP Autofocus 90mm all were "too long" with the 10D's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what I had room for to get the shot. The Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10D for this purpose. Its small, its compact, and its short focal length do not require that I be standing three feet away from the model I'm shooting. As far as shooting at non-static objects, such as insects, the lens is slow to focus and loud, in both noise and vibration, which results in "startled" subjects and missed shots. The same also applies for non-macro shots as well. Its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography, and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well 
I really like this lens but my results are not consistent. I think though this is more of a function of my limited skill of photography. The focal range seems very narrow but when you hit it the results are outstanding. I occasionally get images that are out of focus but again I think this is my fault. I bought this for macro work but I use it as a prime lens most of the time 
First I do not have this lens yet but I am buying it. It is reportedly an excellent lens with very little distortion along the edges (which is why I'm buying it). I will update this review after I have the lens, however, I feel that people should be warned about a big error in another well received review because it will only lead to frustration. Do not listen to John Kwok's suggestion to buy the Canon 60mm macro lens UNLESS you you own the 20d, 300d, or 350d/Rebel XT. The lens is an EF-S lens and as of September, 2005 it will ONLY fit those cameras - it has NOT been optimized for all Canon DSLR's as he states. On the other hand, the 50mm macro here will fit all Canon 35mm film cameras and all digital SLR's. 
The Canon EF 50mm f2.5 macro lens is yet another example of Canon doing a fine job catching up with the likes of Nikon, Zeiss and Leica with respect to optical design; optically it may be the best 50mm macro lens currently available for 35mm SLR film photography. I am impressed that a lens as cheap as this counts at least one aspheric lens element and an apochromatic lens design; unfortunately it is not nearly as durable a lens as the celebrated L series lens line or the Canon EF 100mm macro lens. Unless you are constantly working out in the field taking close-up photography, then the durability of this lens's lens mount and barrel should not be an issue. More importantly for the user is the quality of its images, and having read some test reports on this lens, I have no doubt that it is a capable performer. Those interested in digital macro photography may choose to look instead at the new 60mm macro lens, which is optimized for use with Canon digital SLR cameras 
I never thought a $250 lens could be so good. I have been trying to buy lenses that are light-weight for my 20D, due to a neck injury problem, and this 50mm fits the bill. Great in low light, and agree also, the bokeh is sweet. I do alot of bee chasing and manage some great macros with bees in flight with this one. All hand held. Can also take great indoor shots without flash, with a steady hand.I chose it also because it was one of the least expensive high rated canon 50mm's. It goes well with another inexpensive canon lens, the 55-200mm ef f4.5-5.6 II, which also does well outdoors, including macro. I am very pleased with both, and wouldn't part with them 
Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid conical three and three quarters inch long offers some protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. There is nothing more irritating than reviewing your images to find dust spots or other flaws. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing an expensive L lens. This hood is manufactured for the Canon 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L EF lens and normally comes included with the lens when sold new. There is no need to buy one with the lens as Amazon often suggests. Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. Fortunately Canon provides a storage case with the lens that can be used in addition to your camera bag. While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. PROS: Improves contrast and image quality Offers limited protection to the lens CONS: Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the len 
This hood comes with the 100-400, so don't buy it separately. Pros: - Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element. - Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile 
I picked up the Canon 350d while I was in Italy. I was thinking to upgrade the camera to another Canon that didn't have the built in flash. This flash is great, I've only used it a few times, but I am more than impressed by it's functionality. In the title, I only said "oops" because I think it's more flash than I really need, at least for this camera. Overall, I am more than impressed with this flash 
Super easy to use and significantly extends your flash photo distance over in-camera flashes. Versatile flash direction accommodates multiple scenarios and moods 
This is a very powerful flash unit that works as a master to other Canon flash units. You can get very nice results with a small amount of experimentation. It does what it suppose to. I used it with the 420EX I've had for several years and it worked fine. Mounted on the camera it's a larger version of the built in popup on the 30d with some extra niceties and lots more power. Thinking of the 430EX? Cough up the few extra bucks for this baby, you'll be glad you did. It's a one shot deal, [no pun intended], you'll be using it for years to come. I bought the 420EX for my Elan II E about 6 years ago. It's been a great unit. This one recharges faster and has gobs more power. You'll love it! Don't let all the dials and switches scare you, read the instruction manual 
I bought this flash for my Canon 30D because of the numerous promises Canon makes for how it performs with all of the 30D's automatic and manual functions...and they are RIGHT! In spite of it's relatively small size, it is THE most powerful flash I've used of any brand. Having replaced a non-Canon brand flash that was supposed to work with the 30D but didn't, I could not be more delighted with the 580X. Whether you're shooting in AV, TV, P, or M modes, you will not be disappointed with its performance. It's expensive; but it's worth the price if you rely on your flash to perform to your camera's capabilities 
I didn't have a ton of time to research this flash. I've used it now on several occasions with my Canon 5D and couldn't be happier with it. It's great for shooting portraits. I can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up. I would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser - get's rid of the typical flash harsh light 
I hesitated for a year to upgrade from the 550 to the 580 because, on paper, I did not see much advantage. In fact, the 580 is a worthwhile upgrade. I like the new dial on the back for adjusting exposure compensation, etc. and the catchlight screen is a nice touch but the biggest advantages are the incredibly fast recycling time and smailler size. I can machine gun my 1Ds2 and this flash keeps up. The 550 could not. It is small enough not to overwhelm my little Rebel too. I did note that there is some vignetting at 24mm with a direct flash unless I drop the wide lens screen. The manual says ths will not happen but it does. Not a big deal since I use a Gary Fong diffuser or bounce flash almost always 
Like most every Canon accessory, the 580EX is well made and very expensive. I cheaped out when I bought my Digital Rebel and bought the Sigma EF-500 DG, which was represented as being "almost as good as" the Canon 580EX. That appears to be true. The problem is that "almost" leaves me with no master/slave lighting. So when I picked up a EOS 30D, I bit the bullet and paid the big bucks for the Canon. It works as advertised and nicely makes the Sigma the slave it was really born to be 
I'll spare the technical review of the 580ex Flash for now. I've been using this new flash for on-the-go shootings and find it very helpful especially with the capabilities of using multi flash units and off-shoe mode. It's great on hard to reach places where I want to produce more light or fast moving subjects, i.e. wedding guests and fast pets. I do plan to pick up at least 2 more of these units for it's compatibility on the most part. Not only that I can get good light coverage on the subjects, but the possibilities of making a more interesting artistic photographs that defines my work. Still nothing beats the use of the higher end lighting kits like Profoto Acute systems. But that's alot to lug around. 
I'm very happy with my Speedlite 580EX, is a new dimension for my photographic hobb 
The 580EX is a wonderful flash and I would not hesitate to buy it again. In fact I might even buy a second one. There are however a couple of issues that you should be aware of. 1. The battery compartment door takes a little getting used to. You may feel like you are going to snap it off at first. Not really a big deal though. 2. (and in my opinion this IS a big deal). The `Auto Focus Assist' is completely useless. Its just an LED pointed through a rather bad `lens'. It won't do anything past a couple of feet. A laser diode with diffraction grating would have made it work far past the useable flash distance and at this price Canon should know better. All told however it is a wonderful flash. The circular command dial make adjusting the flash exposure easy (dial in more or less flash relative to ambient light). If you do not have an external flash get one. It makes a huge difference. And this is a great offering. 
I love this camera. It's my second Canon and, at 7MP, the best value for the money I've seen. I took it to France this summer and loved the fact that I could recharge the battery overnight while my friends were constantly changing their batteries (and searching for places to buy them!). My favorite option is the "Scene" button. I don't think I'll ever try the "underwater" option, but the "night shot" and "inside shot" work fantastically. It also seems as though you can take movies until the card or battery fail - which is a huge improvement over my older Canon. Unlike a lot of newer cameras, this one has a viewfinder. A friend of mine has a Nikon that has no viewfinder and it was extremely hard to use in bright sunshine. I carried my camera in my purse without a case a few days ago in New Orleans without a problem - it worked like a charm. I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants an easy-to-use model that produces fabulous results. 
This is a great camera that takes the place of an earlier Canon Digital Elph that I lost several years ago. The 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality and the 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures. In fact the digital zoom also works great - just make sure the camera is steady (I purchased a nice compact monopod and the results were awesome). Although the image stabilization feature on the newer models would have been great to have, you can't beat the price and overall quality of this camera and the pictures it takes. The Canon SD500 is a great little camera 
I'm by no means an expert! This is the first digital I have owned. It took me a long time because I was so used to my film camera. But I searched long and hard to find what I thought I wanted. And so far I am not disappointed. At first the size threw me because everyone else had a bigger camera and I felt it would be hard to handle to take good pics. But that's not the case. I like the feel, the size...I like to be able to throw it in my purse...It takes great pictures to use for my e-bay, and sending to family and friends. I haven't had any pictures printed from it yet, so I don't know how exactly they will come out, but I'm thinking they should be okay since my online pics have been great. I haven't had a single blurry pic, both regular and close up. The video works well...it has lots of little options I don't use..like sounds for each function, but I can change those if I want. Overall I have no complaints 
I bought this camera in February, and it really did a great job in so many different situations. Unfortunately, I lost it this past September and have been kicking myself ever since. I will be purchasing the exact same camera again. Excellent features include: easy to use small good quality (as long as they aren't EXTREMELY close) pictures I like the software that came with the camera good accessories, esp. the camera case clear LCD screen great options for picture taking Good features include: fast shutter speed, although not quite fast enough. I'd like to take more pictures at a faster repetition but cannot with this camera I recommended this camera to my best friend who is a lighting designer for retail spaces (Dolce Gabbana, for instance) and he gives it an excellent review as well, so I know it is good in all types of light and for professional purposes 
I LOVE THIS CAMERA! I bought it to keep in my diaper bag so I always have a camera with me. It's small, easy to use and takes great pictures. I recently sent a few in to have them developed and they came out great. The only recommendation I have is to purchase a larger memory card - the one it comes with only hold a few pictures 
hi i am surendranadha reddy i purchaged a CANON SD500 7.1MP . It is verygood digital camara. previously i used pantex that is also good, but in this photos are very natural and realistic. One more the Amazon price also good. Thank you surendr 
I like the picture quality and features of this camera at this price point so much, its the third one I've purchased. My family seems to be hard on cameras such that this model only seems to last for about a year or so. At that point its been banged around in my wifes purse or accidentally dropped by the kids that the telescoping mechanism for the lens stops working. In doing web research it seems to be a common problem. So if you're typically more gentle than me and my family seem to be, this is a great and easy picture taker 
I bought this camera for $249 new which marked down from the $499 retail. This was an older model as the new models had just come out. For the money this is a good camera, but I am very particular and was not blown away. The images are good, but I was expecting more vibrance. Colors are a bit weak. It will not take a focused shot indoors unless the flash is on, and the flash is way to bright for closer shots. The image is often over exposed, and I find myself placing a piece of paper over the flash to get more of a correct shot. I upgraded from a Canon A40 2 megapixel camera (AMAZING CAMERA!), and the images are very similar in quality, except the new SD500 captures them bigger, having the 7 megapixel chip, hence a little better detail. I do like the small size, and the battery lasts a long time between charges. Holds lots of pictures with the 1 gig card I purchased seperatly. The video quality is quite good for a still camera. 
First Amazon thanks for the great service in delivering our item. It works fantastic. We are very satisfied with it. 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
This is my lens for handheld images of birds in flight. It's sharp and exhibits no color fringing or other chromatic aberration. By comparison, my Leitz 400mm f/6.8 Telyt shows a fair amount of color fringing outside the center region. To be fair, the Telyt is a much simpler design. The Telyt does have higher contrast than the EF 400mm f/4 DO IS, but a levels layer in Photoshop can fix that. The 400mm f/4 DO IS is much lighter than any 400mm f/4 lens with conventional optics. DO lenses have a diffraction element that compensates for the color dispersion of spherical lens elements. It also reduces optical complexity and size. The f/4 speed makes autofocus faster, and allows even better isolation of subjects using narrow depth of field. While bigger and heavier than Canon's 400mm f/5.6L, the f/4 lens is light enough at 4.3 pounds that it's still easy to carry. I've used mine on hikes above 10,000 feet to photograph bighorn sheep. IS definitely makes a difference handheld, and on a tripod below 1/125 second. Canon's 400mm f/5.6L is a non-stabilized lens. I've taken some of my sharpest wildlife images with this lens - you can see every feather in some bird shots. Highly recommended if you can afford one. 
I do not have take more than one bags. This bag is big enough for everything. 
Good quality and very configurable. Fits body plus 2-3 lenses easily. Even fits my camera with a telephoto lens attached and a second backup lens 
My kit includes a Canon D60 DSLR, Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8, Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 macro USM, Sigma 100-300mm f/4, 420 EX Speedlite flash, 4 assorted filters, AAA batteries, 2 extra batteries for the D60 tripod collar. First few times I tried to fit everything in, my Sigma 100-300 did not find space. I was about to return this bag, but tonight, decided to give it another try (10th attempt). And surprise, surprise... the best configuration just came to me all of a sudden. With the Sigma lens on the bottom, stretched out to occupy the width of the bag, the 100mm and the flash fits perfectly on the remaining part of the bag's bottom. Then, a divider on top, to prevent scratching, place the D60 and the Tamron lens attached on top, and the height of the bag makes it easily possible to fit everything in, and close the hood, without stretching the bag at all. My 4 filters (jn their think cases go into the front pouch. The generous side-pockets fit my tripod collar for the 100-300, 2 spare batteries, a new and a box of 12 AAA batteries .... this means my entire kit fits perfectly, without the bag being stretched uncomfortably. I'm glad I gave it this one try 
I bought this bag to use with my Canon Elura 100 Camcorder. Camcorder's these days are as small as camera, but I knew I'd need a lot of room for accessories and this bag fit the bill. I have in this bag right now: Camcorder, 5 MiniDV Tapes, Extra Battery, Head Cleaner, Extra Wide Angle Lens, External Mic, L-Bracket for mounting Mic, Lens Cleaning Kit, Remote Control, All Wires, Lens Filters. And I still have room for quite a bit more! What I love about this bag is that it's really a BIG bag that doesn't at all feel like a BIG bag - and that's a great thing to me! The inside is super configurable which is great 'cause you can set it up the way that is best for the accessories you have so that everything fits, but doesn't move around. This same bag cost almost double at Best Buy and other retail stores so it's a steal here at Amazon! I LOVE it 
This camera bag is just as I expected. What was written as a description fits it perfectly. Nice bag! Great response time in delivery. Thanks 
I have had this bag now for over 9 months and can honestly say it has more then surpassed my expectations. It stores everything I need when out with family or friends to catch all the action in one convenient place. In the center of the bag I have the following: 1. Rebel XT body 2. Canon 430EX Flash 3. 17mm-85mm Lens 4. 75mm-300mm Lens 5. Sony Handycam Video Recorder 6. Power plug for charging Video Recorder On the sides I store the Battery Chargers and Batteries for Flash, Camera and Video Camera, plus Tapes for the Video Camera. The front holds all the manuals for everything and a few extra Memory Cards and lens covers. Even after this, there is still space in the bag for other things. The bag has held up very well and can see no signs of wear or tear after dragging this bag all over the place for the last 9 months. 
Pros: - Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element. - Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile. 
Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shaped one and three quarters inch long offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Being so shallow and petal shaped, even this type of protection is limited. Even if the protection is limited, replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing an expensive L lens. This hood is manufactured for the Canon 24-105mm f/4.0L EF and normally comes included with the lens when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. This lens isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem. While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. PROS: Improves contrast and image quality Reduces lens flare problems Offers limited protection to the lens CONS: Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens High price for a molded piece of plasti 
I enjoy that I can get a closer shot now. Its quality is good. I am happy with the purchas 
Jim K. made a great review.....I just wanted to let you know that I agree. This is great. It is very light weight. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is that you need to zoom a bit or else you get a burnout effect (a circle where the corners are dark because it is getting the inside of the lens). That is annoying, and forces you to remove the extender when you want to take closer photos. At a distance though, it is great. Pictures come out great. I highly recommend this.....I would have given it 4.5 stars if it were an option 
Question: The Canon S2 has only 1 color - silver. I believe this telephoto converter came in only black, doesn't it look silly to have a silver camera with a long black nose? I was going to get this adaptor but I am holding back because of it's color. Instead, I am looking to find a adaptor and converter kit that comes in silver instead of black. Although I don't have this converter. Assuming that I am satisfied with its quality and featuers, I would only give it only 4.5 stars because of it's color. Anyone has any ideas 
I was surprised at the heft of this tele converter when it arrived. It comes in a pullstring pouch that offers reasonable protection in a camera bag, purse, or other similar carying case and will hold the lens while attached to the required adapter. It also comes with a lens cap for each end. The converter has a high quality look and feel throughout, and as with the lens hood included in the inexpensive adapter kit (required), the mounting threads are cut accurately enough that the lettering on the lens and hood all line up perfectly at the top of the assembly. It looks as I would expect from Canon, which is to say, instrument quality. OK, looks don't make good pictures, so here is the rest of the story. The body is made of tough, lightweight materials (FRP?, polycarbonate?), so what you feel when you take the lens out of the case is the weight of several glass elements. The glass coating is well done, as pictures are nice and contrasty. Flare and distortion are minimal, and on par with a quality SLR offering. The base lens on the S2 is fairly fast, and doesn't suffer from defects at maximum telephoto, so this converter was built to complement that quality, and it does a fine job. As a matter of fact, the converter lens is optimized to supplement only the telephoto portion of the main camera lens range, At less than moderate telephoto settings, you end up with a view of the back end of the converter lens, and not much else. Used as intended, it gives you the ability to use your 5 mp sensor to take spectacular 650 mm telephoto shots with incredible sharpness, color, and detail. There is no comparison to digital zoom at all. This lens alows you to "reach out and touch someone" while using every pixel your sensor has available, and without adding eyeball noticable distortion at all. On top of that, the image stabilizer in the camera lets you shoot 650 mm telephoto pictures handheld in reasonable lighting conditions. Check out the price of a 600 mm image stabilized lens for an SLR and get back to me after you recover. Sure, having a $5,000 SLR body/lens combo will win the comparison at a lab bench, and might be a stop faster (only on the high end though), but the S2/teleconverter combo lets you take far better and more creative pics than the classic 35 mm with a mirror tele lens can ever offer. Further cropping the photos on your computer later will simply amaze you. For the price, it's a must have item. It also catches the action on the field in movie mode from the nosebleed seats at the stadium. It is a big lens, and will make your S2 look as though it must be an SLR, but the combination of S2 and teleconverter is light enough (compared to an SLR) to carry all day long in a desert without a problem. It offers the digicam prosumer quality glass reach that used to be reserved for higher end SLR's. For what it adds to your photographic range, it's cheap, too. One suggestion. The lens adapter/lens hood combo you need to mount any of the three converter lenses Canon offers is dirt cheap. The combo sells for around 26 bucks everywhere. The adapter attaches to the camera with a push button release bayonet mount, is quick to change, and feels very secure. The adapter also takes 58 mm filters of all kinds, and I like to keep a UV filter mounted on my camera for the improvement in contrast it offers, and to protect the camera lens from damage (I dropped my S2 this past weekend, and the Hoya UV filter took the fall. It dented, but didn't break). Anyway, because they are so cheap, I suggest getting one for the S2, and each converter lens you buy. That way, you can switch lenses in an instant, and keep the front of each lens protected with it's own UV filter and/or hood. Oh yes. A good circular polorizer filter really kills glare, and brings out contrast with any lens under many typical shooting conditions. The tele-converter lens does not have front threads to mount filters (most don't), but I made an adapter by mounting a 72 mm UV filter to a 7/16" long cardboard masking tape core with an inside diamerter that slipped snugly over the end of the tele-converter. Prior to gluing the UV filter to the tube section, I painted the tube flat black. Now, the circular polorizer (or any other 72 mm filter attaches to the adapter, looks like it belongs there, and works perfectly. I think you will enjoy this converter as much as I do. Good shooting.

This hood does a more than adequate job at controlling flare on the EF 100mm f/2. Additionally, the hood can provide protection to those who 1) do not adorne their lenses with UV/SKY filters, or 2) do so adorne them! The lens is already a capable performer; it is moreso with the hood. The price is a bit steep, but that does not effect its performance. Thus, my rating stands 
It's easy to attach -- and detach -- and works well with most (but not all) of my 58mm lens. It does cut down on glare, and let's face it, the hood makes your lens look a bit more dynamic, while also protecting it from the elements

There is nothing more irritating than reviewing your images to find dust spots or other flaws. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing or replacing a lens. This hood is manufactured for the Canon 85 f/1.8 USM EF, 100 f/2.0 USM EF, 135 f/2.8 USM EF, 100-300 f/4.5-5.6 USM EF lenses and normally is not included with the lens when sold new.

This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. Fortunately Canon provides a storage case with the lens that can be used in addition to your camera bag. While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited.

I bought this hood for Canon's 85mmf1.8 lens, one incredible lens. Years ago I went to a lecture by Ernst Wilde, MR. Hasseblad himself, where he showed the difference that a lens hood would make on a Hasseblad lens. Since then I have always used them faithfully on every lens I own. The longer the lens, the more efective the lens hood can be if it is specifically designed for that lens. This is the hood Canon has for their medium telephoto lenses, the 85f1.8, 100usm macro, and 135mmf2.8 lenses. The hood will protect your lens from dust, scratches, damage, while at the same time preserving the maximum contrast your lens can deliver. This differs from a filter, that will take away from the inherit lens sharpness and contrast. A analogy is wearing a baseball cap which will improve your vision and protect your eyes from cataracts, while not distorting your vision like sunglasses will 
I bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 Mark I (the version with the metal mount and distance scale) that I purchased recently. Canon specs the discontinued ES-65 hood for this lens. The great thing about this ET-65III is that it is longer, so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs. The interior on this mark III version is also flocked, providing a bit more light absorption. I've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college, but this hood is definitely worth the investment: well built, fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera), and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep). Note that this will NOT fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 Mark II version (all plastic mount with no distance scale) 
What a great little piece of kit. It's great with my EF 70-200mm f/4L. The only drawback is you've no AF. You are forced to use manual focus. Now this isn't a big problem, unless you're photographing wildlife or moving objects. Well worth the price though and very useful 
Just received Canon EF 2X II from Adorama. Paid $279.95 plus $17.95 shipping. Len has been previously used and placed back in the pouch and sold as new. Len cap is marred with several scratches. Looks to have been handled rough. My advice is bypass Adorama as a third party vendor and buy directly from Amazon. Adorama refunds within 14 days less shipping. Thats $17.95 for me to return a used product sold as new. Won't go there again 
This high quality extender is a great addition to my Canon EF 70-200 L f/4 !! With a top-notch build quality and a tough, weather resistant design equal to that of their highly respected line of L lenses, Canon has produced a great product for its unbeatable zoom lens !! Although the 2X extender renders the A/F function useless on many Canon cameras, I found this to be a Very small drawback overall ( I prefer to manually focus under many of my shooting conditions). This extender is more suited for a low f/number lens due to the 2-stop change in brightness, but it is still VERY effective with my f/4 in normal lighting. A lightweight and fairly inexpensive way to double your focal length, while maintaining the incredible optical quality of the main lens...My backpack will always contain my 2X and 1.4X extenders ! 
The POWER-2000 XP-333 charges batteries in pairs, with one LED per pair, not as described. The XP-555 charges each battery independently and slightly faster (3 vs 4 hours). The XP-333 charger is very lightweight, the XP-555 is slightly heavier. They work on 110 or 220 V and includes plug adaptors for round European type plugs. I have used the XP-333 in the USA and overseas. POWER-2000 makes several other charger models as well. The XP-333 and 555 AAs are 2500 mAh, and there are XP-33327 and XP-55527 versions now available with 2700 mAh batteries. AAA batteries charge faster as they hold less charge. AAAs from Power-2000 currently come in 850 and 1000 mAh capacities. I believe that these capacities for AA and AAA from POWER-2000 and other NiMH makers are twice as great or maybe more than alkalines. As I recall, some years ago Duracell copper top AAs have 1100 mAh. I have not found recent figures on the web, but got the old figure by calling the 800 number on the Duracell packages. Duracell Ultras appear to have a bit higher mAh figure, but I do not know that that is. The 1.2 V for NiMH vs 1.5 V for alkalines seems to make no practical difference as I am told, and I believe it is correct, that alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 V after initial use while I understand that the NiMH holds its 1.2 V value for some time. 
The Kodak PH160 Media Cartridge Kit is the best bargain around! You get 4 cartridges plus paper in each pack. I have used more paper than ink! Thank you Kodak for such a money saving kit 
Very convenient. Easy to use. Paper and cartridge matched up for quantities is a smart idea. Sometimes the printer jams but easy to clear. I find the colors a bit dark and skin tones not balanced to be the most attractive. If they can work on these items this would be a fantastic device and I would probably keep several for office, home, garage, travel...and use a lot of media cartridges too. I am one of those that takes 800-1000 pictures on a two week vacation so I really would use the heck out of these cartridges if the image quality were better. I usually make 3 or 4 copies of each print to mail to friends that are in the pictures 
I find these PH160 packages of toner cartridges and photo paper to be the best deal for me. I take a LOT of pictures and print them off to send as postcards to friends all over the USA. This way I have plenty of the photo paper on hand and a good supply of the toner cartridges and don't have to constantly run to the store to buy a single toner cartridge and package of photo paper. I do wish however that you could just buy the toner cartridges without the photo paper as I always have more paper than what I can use with the number of toner cartridges 
This product works really well, and the price was great. I am always pleased with the quality of Kodak 
We love this product.Took me minutes to hook up. So easy to use. I understand total cost of printing is few Cents more than what you can get in Costco.But.its the ease of use AT HOME!Specially if U have guests at home....and you wanna give instant photos...hmm....Cosco/Walmart....going on a Christmas day.....I dont think so!!!! My guests love it....when we give them photos....right after the party! Everybody gets a kick out of it! Amazon.....GOOG SERVICE!ON TIME!!! N 
I can't believe how advanced things have become. The quality of the pictures that are printed on the Kodak Easy share media cartridge. 
Kodak has made printing pictues as simple as 123. The paper cartridge snaps in place quite easily. It can be removed quickly and stored out of the way because the paper is protected in its own tray with convenient lid. This is high quality paper and has a protective coating that is applied to the photo to give it many years of durability. I thought the price was competative with other methods of printing with photo paper 
I won the Kodak printer at a scrapbook convention then went on the hunt to find the refills at a reasonable price. Purchasing the 160 count made the price per print the lowest beat out anything I could find in the local stores. It is a great convenience to be able to whip out a 4x6 print instead of having to download it to a store's website, wait a few days, go there pick it up, etc. Great value 
I love this product, because I love the camera and the printing dock. I have been using them for 2 years. My daughter-in -law and son got theirs a little earlier because of the arrival of their first child. I saw it and had to have one of these marvelous things that I could do by myself at home. I think she discovered your site and that you sold the product. We have both purchased from you a few times. Thanks for the reasonable film prices that have allowed me to take more pictures and copy for my friends and relatives 
The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry. 
I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05). Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect. There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly 
I almost didn't buy this camera simply because of the plastic body (I'm used to a Praktica MTL3 film camera, which is built like a tank). However, I'm glad I overlooked that because the camera is top-notch in terms of robust features and the quality it provides. Startup time is very quick and making adjustments to shutter speed and aperture is intuitive. If you get the bundle with the kit lens, I highly recommend complimenting it with the very affordable Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens, especially if you are a big fan of DOF and do a lot of available-light / low-light photography. 
I am new to SLRs and I cant belive how good this camera is. This camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces. I always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent, but looking back, they look terrible compared to this. 
This Camera is excellent one!! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category, I'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles.. Highly recommended 
It is extremely easy to use. Hard to figure out the menu, but once that is done there is no problem. Takes beautiful pictures. Great for action shots as well. Seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in 
When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery. They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes. Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice. So I said no. So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots. Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase. Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button. So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine. as for the quality of photos.....i love them 
I had 2 Rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses. While I had owned other digitals I keep going back to my old Rebel, until now. We got the back up battery pack. My husband and I love it 
It's not the best looking remote you'll ever find but the design is made practical to fit the strap. You'll never lose this remote and it works like a charm 
I decided to get this after buying the Rebel XTi and already owning the Rebel XT (this works with both.) I already had the corded shutter release which was nice when doing long exposures or macro work where even a little camera shake can make a huge difference. But this goes to a new level, you can set the camera up get everything in focus and then step back and take as many shots as you want without any risk of touching the camera. Make sure to cover the eyepiece when using this so stray light doesn't ruin your exposure. This is also handy when you want to take pictures with you in them. I have even used it with two cameras at once to get multiple angles of the same shot. I am thinking about setting up a blind and setting up the camera on a tripod to try to get some close up pictures of wildlife that would not be possible otherwise. Basically if you ever have a need to take pictures without holding the camera this is your solution 
I bought the remote control so that I could trip the shutter while my camera was on a tripod. Mostly landscape stuff. It works great for my intended use. The only minor problem is that you have to point the remote control at the front of the camera. I have found that it works fine if I hold the remote in front of, and below the lens (out of view of the lens) 
My photography does not have much call for a wireless remote but this was too easy to pass up. It delivered as advertised and I am finding that I am using it in place of a wired remote for ultra close up and low light photagraphy when using a tripod. It is very small so it is easy to pack away anywhere 
good remote. Can be finnicky at times if not lined up correctly with the camera 
I bought this remote for canon digital rebel XT. Pretty much programs itself. Great asset that it clips to camera strap. Works from good distance. Highly recommen 
I like using a tripod with my long zoom lens, and this device has really added to my hobby. The remote is perfect for taking pictures of birds in my birdbath and squirrels and other critters in my yard. I personally don't like cables, I don't like dealing with them. This is just right for my purposes. The remote is also better for taking pics of people. It is much better than a timer in my opinion since I can move people in and out easier and more efficiently, taking pictures more quickly. This gives me so much more control than using a timer. 
Got it. worked as per described. value for money. works both from front and behind for rabel XT(somebody wrote here it doesn't work from the back side of the camera) 
I am lifelong photographer and I purchased this camera in January. I have taken it on several major trips. It is an wonderful performer. I have many 11x14 enlargements that I have received terrific feedback on. The quality of this camera and the Cannon optics will not disappoint. The price is right now that the replacement is out. 
Wonderful camera. Very flexiable, very versitile. Can be the most wonderful creation device in someone whom is capable. Def a good buy now that the 30D is out. I've had this camera for over a year and I STILL love it 
Excellent Camera with high end capabilities. Easy to use and intuitive system controls 
I am just a hobbyist. This was a big purchase and a big step for me to get into this level of camera. I still haven't mastered using it yet, and I've had it for a few months. It does a wonderful job of taking pictures. If you have the right lenses, it can take some of the most beautiful pictures you've ever seen. Again, I'm just a hobbyist/enthusiast. I use it to take pictures for work, too. I highly recommend getting a couple of VERY good lenses to go with it. Don't go with the cheap lenses that Canon, Tamron, Sigma, etc. make for this camera. Do yourself a favor and get a nice zoom - spend some bucks. You'll be happy you did. The camera itself is pretty easy to use if you leave it on auto, but that's like buying a race car and never shifting out of first gear. The auto settings are great, and they do a wonderful job, but you can do so much more if you learn to use the camera in Manual, Av, Tv, or P mode. It allows you so much more creativity that you'll be amazed at the difference. The 30D came out right before I bought the 20D, and I would probably buy it for the price now, but I'm very happy with my 20D 
This camera is really great. I knew I liked it before, but I immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when I ended up with a Rebel XT as a "loaner" while my 20d was in repair. Not that the XT is a bad camera, it just doesn't really compare to the 20d. The 20d has a nice feel to it; it is fairly large, which is great since I have somewhat large hands. The features are great too. And the image quality is awesome. I don't really need to go into all of the details, as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job. Let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars. The only complaint I have about the camera is that it doesn't have spot metering. The ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d. 
Impressive feature list wih affordable price, for the serious ameteur. i've been using the 20D with 18-55, 50mm 1.8, 35-80, 80-200 and 500/1000mm lenses. i am not disappointed. i am planning to upgrade to the L series lenses but slowly. i do not mean to be over entusiastic about canon, but i am yet to see a Nikon camera with the same specs at the same or ever a near equal price. i've got the FM10 for film photography. i love both my cameras. Impressive features include: Mirror lockup ISO 3200 with noise reduction 18 custom functions accepts the entire series of canon lens. heavy metal body (no cheap plastic feel 
This camera is amazing, I couldn't have asked for more. Just be warned that the manual is pretty terrible. It's best to just play around with the camera until you figure it out, rather than wasting time trying to decipher the manual 
My kids are in competitive Tae Kwon Do. I have now used the camera my wife gave me one year ago at several tournaments. It is able to stop action and take great shots even in low lighting. Now, we tried it when we went skiing and it also worked great in the glare conditions of the snow. I bought a monopod that worked real well to stabalize and I use software called PhotoFinale to crop and share the photos. One year into the usage I am still looking forward to each chance I get to play with this "toy". Next options: battery grip, flash diffuser, extra remote flash.. 
I bought this camera about 2 months before my son was born. I knew little about Digital SLRs, but after research I found that this was the one for me. This camera is well constructed and durable. The pictures are excellent. I have blown a few of my pictures up to 11X17 without any problem. Also, if you are going to be doing any editing of photos on your computer, this camera would be great. I would recommend purchasing the newest version of Photoshop or Photoshop elements (when I bought mine it only came with Elements 2.0 and 3.0 was already on the market). Also, if you want your pictures to turn out, you MUST purchase a larger flash. The onboard flash is weak, will leave shadows and it does not allow you to do any type of "bounce" flash. On the whole, this is the best camera I have ever had in my life and it would be great for anyone who has previous experience with SLR cameras. 
This is my first L lens. As an amateur, this really makes you see the difference in lenses. I use this as a general lens and have basically put away the lens that came in the kit. I am also planning to purchase the 100-400mm IS for better wildlife and family sports photography. Wish it came with a better lens hood. 
The walkaround lens. This very topic leads to a heated discussion among DSLR photographers. First, determine your budget, focal length, and aperture needs. If you frequently find yourself zooming out to get everything in a frame, you will want a wide angle lens such as this. If you frequently find yourself zooming in, this is not the lens for you. On a full frame body such as Canon EOS 5D, this lens becomes ULTRA wide angle. On an APS-C crop body such as Digital Rebel XTi (which I used for this review), it becomes MEDIUM wide angle. But thanks to 1.6x crop factor, this lens expands to more usable 35mm equivalent focal length of 27 to 64mm. Second, audition the lens if you can. By definition, a walkaround lens should be relatively portable. At 1.1 lbs., Canon's EF 17-40mm f/4L USM is neither super light nor neck breakingly heavy. In fact, it weighs almost the same as Digital Rebel XTi -- really nice balance. The lens feels very solid with supreme build quality that only L-series lenses offer. Although this lens is weather proof and therefore sealed against liquid and dust, I strongly recommend getting a 77mm filter to protect the front lens element. With it, this lens is made to last. In terms of looks and feel, it doesn't get much better. Its rubberized full-time inner focus manual ring USM focuses smoothly, quietly, and quickly. Since it's inner focus, the lens will not extend beyond its metal casing whether you zoom in or out. The focus window shows focusing distance from 0.28 meter (0.92 feet) to infinity. The focal length marker indicates 17, 20, 24, 28, 35, and 40mm. The lens exudes quality from tip to tip. You may tolerate heavier lens or may not mind lesser build quality of cheaper lenses. A walkaround lens will be used very often, so make sure you will be comfortable with it. This lens is famous for saturated color and deep contrast. Its images are simply stunning. At 17mm wide angle, barrel distortion is noticeable but relatively mild. From 24mm to 40mm, its images are distortion free and perfectly suited at capturing people. Vignetting (corner darkness) is minimal with mild chroma abberrations (color shadows). At f/4 aperture, details become noticeably softer toward the edges. The center region is very sharp and at f/5.6, edges remain fairy sharp. Thanks to 7 diaphragm blades, this lens can produce very nice bokeh at 40mm (blur effects). One of the most cited weaknesses is the f/4 aperture. In my experience, a bump in the ISO speed and steady hands are all you need to take well focused images indoor. On the other hand, if you are shooting with very little amount of light, you might wish for f/2.8 or image stabilizer. Although the difference between f/4 and f/2.8 is just 1 stop, my other lens, Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM (too heavy to be my walkaround lens) easily outperforms in such challenging situations. But by and large, I was not handicapped by the f/4 aperture. Some of the main competitions (sorted by price): - Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 EX DC: Arguably the best wide angle lens for limited budget. The focus mechanism is a bit slow, corner is very soft, chroma abberrations can be a bit of an issue, and the lens is highly prone to flare. Works only with EF-S mount. - Sigma AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC macro: A bit more expensive than Sigma 18-50mm, but has wider focal range with macro capability. - Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM: This "traveler's lens" has a wider focal range than most wide angle lenses (widest among Canon) and is equipped with an image stabilizer. But the lens is famous for extreme barrel distortion at 17mm and chroma abberrations. Works only with EF-S mount. - Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 Di II LD Aspherical (IF): This is the most direct competitor. It takes sharper images with faster aperture while costing less. Both the build and focus mechanism are significantly worse, but should be good enough for many. Works only with EF-S mount. - Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM: This is THE reference, if you can afford it. Its images have razor sharp details and great performance all around (minus vignetting, which is typical of EF-S lenses). The build quality is worse than L-series but not too shabby. Works only with EF-S mount. This is the best EF-S lens hands down. - Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L USM: One of the most expensive wide angle zoom lenses. It's larger and heavier, but has f/2.8 aperture. This is how Canon EF 17-40mm f/4 USM stacks up. Pros: - Among the very best build quality. - Excellent, buttery smooth, super fast front-focus system. - Top notch color and contrast. Very sharp center resolution. - Almost non-existent vignetting, generally low distortion, and well controlled chroma abberrations. - Ideal weight and size for walkaround purpose Cons: - Edge softness at f/4 aperture. - Narrower focal length than most competing lenses. - Slower than some third party lenses. All in all, this is an excellent wide angle walkaround lens. It may not offer the most bang for the buck, but if you value full frame compatibility (EF lens mount) and excellent build quality, this is the default choice. This lens comes with a nice pouch and a lens hood. I find the hood to be somewhat ridiculously shaped and because the lens is resistant to flare, I do not use it often when shooting outdoor 
This is a great lens. I use it on full-frame film and digital SLRs, and love getting ultrawide shots. However, if you have the cash, you'll probably be happier with the 16-35/2.8 lens, as f4 can be pretty slow indoors 
This lens produces magical images. I am stunned by its sharpness, contrast and color saturation. Simply amazing! This is a great option as a standard zoom for APS-C cameras and a great wide-angle option for full-frame. For APS-C ussers, I have sold my EF-S 17-85 IS USM because this is just miles better. I simply love this lens! I am now so sold on the difference an L makes, that I have also sold my telephoto lens for a 70-200 f4 L. I believe this is a great investment because: * Canon lenses lose very little of their value * Should Canon abandon the APS-C sized sensor for full-frame 35mm, then the EF lens range will make your kit far more future-proof * Once the initial sting of the price has receded, you will never regret the quality of the images you take with this lens Just try it - it's awesome! Some reviewers call this a slow lens - I would disagree. Many zooms are f3.5-5.6, or perhaps f3.5-4.5 in the pro-sumer range. There is virtually nothing between f3.5 and f4, and a constant f-stop is an advantage. f4 is not fast, but it's certainly not slow, either 
I am really glad that I bought this lens. It comes with hood which can be reversed when not in use so it is very useful. Leather pouch, front cap, and back cap is included. Focusing is super fast with USM. 
Having owned the distortion-prone Nikkor AFS 17-35 f2.8D for six years, it was time to switch over to Canon's EF 17-40 mm f4L USM. Canon's version was over a $1000 cheaper, optically superior and lighter in weight. For me, an outstanding standard lens when coupled with the Canon 5D. Vignetting at f4 is minimal. Adobe Photoshop CS2's vignetting tool can correct the vignetting. Distortion at 17mm is minimal. Less than Canon's EF 16-35 mm f2.8L USM set at 16 mm. With the 5D pointed at a blue sky, the EF 17-40 hunted for a focus point while the EF 16-35 didn't. Flaring is minimal when compared to the EF 16-35. Portraits taken at 40 mm produced better results than the EF 16-35 and AFS 17-35 at 35 mm. Images produced at f4 are sharp. At f8, the images are very sharp. This lens is a definite keeper. 
This is a magnificent lens deserving of high praise. In general, I tend to shoot "available light" and towards wide angle, and EF 17-40 F4L is one perfect lens for someone like me. On an APS size sensor camera (mine is Rebel XT), it works approximately like a 28-70 mm zoom--a perfect walk-around lens, giving you decent wide angle and at the tele end, a pleasing perspective on faces you expect from a moderate telephoto. I spent two weeks with EF 17-40 on the coast shooting nature and street stuff in small towns. It performed perfectly. But I only realized what a real treasure I have when I began having second thoughts about it on the eve of a long overseas journey. I asked myself whether I would not have done better buying EF-S 17-85 F4-5.6 IS. After all, it gives you better reach - an equivalent of 28-135 mm zoom on a 35 mm camera. Would it not be a perfect lens on an overseas trip? A dilemma worhty of Hamlet. So I decided to order it from Amazon while I still had time to return EF 17-40. As soon as EF-S 17-85 came, I did some tests taking pictures of still life, flowers and a portrait at similar focal lengths and at full zoom. The results put 17-85 to shame. Color and light were flat and paled next to 17-40. But there was still the problem of reach. I took a portrait at full zoom of the same person (40 mm or 65 mm equivalent and 85 mm or 135 equivalent), cut out the critical focus area from both pix and equalized the two crops in terms of pixel numbers. Unprocessed, 17-85 produced a perfectly focused picture, the 17-40 crop was visibly softer, but in terms of tonality and richness of gradations, it was way ahead of its rival. Photoshop to the rescue! After I fiddled with sharpening and contrast in CS2, the focus softness in 17-40 was gone, and the result was a better all-around picture of the same portrait detail. In other words, if you wish to take a picture, say, of a building's detail or a monkey mug shot in a zoo--a situation calling for a telephoto of 135 mm that 17-85 is capable of--EF 17-40 F4 can do the job, in fact a better job in terms of textures and tonality--and focus, too, if you do a little post-processing in SC2. I am returning EF-S 17-85 and will stick with EF 17-40, taking it on my overseas trip. Unlike EF-S 17-85 F4-5.6, which is a feels like a decent consumer zoom, EF 17-40 F4L is built like a tank and has weather sealing. It should also come in handy if and when I decide to switch to a full-frame camera (EF-S lenses work only with the APS-size sensors). 
I also have the SB-600 and this product, the SB-800, is much better - and worth the extra $100. It is much easier to use since it has a simple menu structure and not the wierd button combo selections of the SB-600. The flash output is better, the recycle time is better and you can use the flash as a commander for other wireless flashes. Also the extra battery holder for a fifth battery reduces recycle time further and never comes off my unit. The diffusion head is also included so you don't have to buy a separate one from Stofen... works great 
I purchased this Speedlight for my D70s. It is easy to take out of the box and fire up. But it's capable of a lot more than your standard portraiture and vacation shots. I have been using this unit for in-store photography and it's worked wonders. The included filters help balance out the horrific fluorescent lighting found in most stores. While it's highly intuitive, I can also control it's output. This is an essential part of any Nikon package 
I would not be able to imagine shooting without the SB-800, it's just so integral to my photography. My only gripe is the TTL preflashes which can cause some people to blink of half-blink by the time the main flash goes off. But you can easily get around this by using FV lock. Fill flash is perhaps the most excellent function of the SB-800. I usually stop it down about by -1.3EV to -1.7EV to get imperceptable results 
Nikon designed this unit to exploit the possibilities of their latest digital SLRs while still being compatble with their oldest F-series cameras. The SB-800 is more expensive than the SB-600, but it gives you more control and more light. You may find more light to be critical if you want to use bounce flash to soften shadows. I would have given the SB-800 five stars if the user manual had been a little better. Nikon obviously tried very hard to provide good documentation, and to make the user interface as intuitive as possible. But, a unit with so many features and modes inevitably will require effort to learn, and will present cases where you are working against the built in automation. Expect to make a large number of experimental shots if you really want to learn how to use this unit. My chief plea to Nikon would be for a more straight forward explanation that cameras like the D50 DO NOT HAVE TTL FLASH. The so called i-TTL uses pre flashes and computation to set up a calculated flash rather than a real time measurement during the exposure to quench the flash. One would normally expect the same result, but not if a slave flash is used. One of the beauties of the SB-800, however, is that it can be used as a slave unit using its own sensor to determine when the master unit is firing, even if (as in the case of a D50 using its built in flash) the camera and the SB-800 are not communicating i-TTL info via IR pulses 
Here is my point. When you buy a digital SLR, most likely in a couple years there will a newer model available with some better features for the same price. But lenses as well as flashes a not changing that fast and keep value much longer. So from a purely financial prospective, it's always better to invest more in the long lasting lenses and flashes and less in the DSLR body. Another point. Most people don't need all advanced feature of the modern flashes and can probably easily survive without them. But also almost everyone sooner or later finds him/herself in a situation, when the place is just too dark and too big. So it's more likely you'll need just more raw power then any of the advanced features. So the bottom line, since a general purpose flash is usually a long term investment, if you have a choice, try to get the most powerful one 
Bought it together with the D50, 6 month ago. Simply the best choice for digital Nikon SLR, superior compared to the high-end flashes for the analog Nikon cameras. Within a range of up to 60feet this flash will brighten very smooth, no red eyes, the press will focus perfectly. But you need the 5th battery, and you better spent the money for high-end batteries, don't use "consumer-type" rechargeable ones. They will last for a very short time only, not enough to fill a 1GB card! 
For those of you who have the D200 and are wondering if you need this flash consider this. That with the D200's built in flash acting as commander you can use the SB800 off camera. Just set it up on it's included stand and coordinate the flash and the camera conrols and you now have the ability to capture portraits that look professional. Set it up behind your subject, off to the side, angle bounce for anywhere. I am sure you get the idea. Just one more reason why the Nikon is a great value. Think about what it would cost you to have similiar capability with your Canon. This flash may seem high priced but it is the most sophisticated unit on the market in my opinion. Good luck! 
I do have to say, being a semi-pro photographer, this one item has made a vast difference in many of my shots. It has allowed me to get studio like shots (to an extent) without having to use those giant studio flashes that cost thousands of dollars. I was able to just set up a few hot lights and use the SB-800 off camera thanks to that amazingly wonderfull wireless feature and got great quality shots for what I needed to do. Also, being a concert photographer, in low light areas this works great especially since most tour managers don't take to highly of Flash use, it allows me to be farther back and get a great shot since I know have a little more fill light to work with. The SB-800 I do have to say is by far one of the few products that you won't regret paying a high price for. I had originally thought of getting the 600 and decided to go all out and get the 800 after reading all the featuers it has that the SB-600 doesnt. This product, coupled with my D70 and DR-6 right angle viewfinder (another great investment you should all look into) give me so many great shots, I do have to say the only design flaw about the SB-800 is that I can't use the DR-6 while the flash is on the camera unless I buy a bracketing system. Most of the time though, When I am useing the DR-6 I am at an angle where the pop-up works just fine but there have been a few times that I wish I could use the 800 as well. So for those who are unsure between this and the SB-600, go with this product. Now all I have to do is find a better lens then my Sigma 28-300 and I am all set. Anyone know where to find a good deal on the 18-200mm Nikor Lens? If so someone (if there is a way) please email or contact me I have a myspace search my company Hope this helps at least one person Brad Premier Image 
Just bought my first SLR (D50) and my first external flash (SB-800 AF). I didn't know what to expect, but I was amazed! I could take the flash into a very dark (mostly candle lit) and large (40'x65') room and take a shot that looked like daylight. As far as the speed, its amazing - I can shoot off 12 shots in continuous mode on my camera and the flash will keep up (sometimes it will miss a shot or two - still trying to figure that one out). So far, I couldn't be more pleased 
Nice intermediate level flash, works great within its perameters 
I'm an amateur photographer, with mediocre skills. This flash makes all my photos look better vs the built-in, with little to no intervention on my part. I use it with a Digital Rebel. I like that the flash varies in intensity, depending on ambient. Time between flashes is reasonably quick (particularly when ambient doesn't require a full flash). To avoid washed out faces, I'd always gotten accustomed to bouncing the flash off walls/ceiling (on my old camera setup). I've learned that I don't need to do that with the 420EX, and almost always keep it directly pointed at subjects (unless I'm trying to purposely create shadows across people's faces). I also seem to get much less redeye vs built in 
I bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my Rebel XT. Amazingly, I find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit. I find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance (8-10 feet) to be under-exposed unless I correct the exposure using the menu. Would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430EX are better, but I cannot recommend this one 
All my life I have seen myself and especially babies for some reason be a victim of redeye. I bought this right before my son was born and have taken nothing but beautiful pictures ever since and haven't had a single red eye no matter how light someone's eyes are. Another great benefit/feature is to be able to bounce the flash off of the ceiling or wall to avoid ghost face (to go along with the devil eye) It takes BEAUTIFUL pictures even in dimly lit rooms without a smidge of graininess. (see one of the two pictures of my son indoors in the customer images for this product) We use this with the Canon digital Rebel XT 
This flash is working great for me. It has an amazing recycle time. I have been able to easily fire off multiple shots indoors in low light without missing a beat. I have also used it in a completely dark room, and all worked great. I don't like the locks on the bounce head, it is necessary to press the release on the side prior to tilting. Just a minor annoyance 
First off, this lens works wonderfully with Canon's 20D, 30D and 5D. The image stabilization gives the photographer a serious edge. In my experience, when the IS is active, I'm able to shoot at a much lower speed, without having any blurring. Throughout the range of the lens, image sharpness is excellent, although a little soft when you zoom near 300. Otherwise, from 75 to 280 aprox. image quality is astonishing. I have shot at weddings, sport events, low-light conditions and very in cold climate conditions and the lens performed flawlessly. The ability of focussing manually is a plus. Automatic focus is always accurate. Just a few times in more than 3000 shots has the lens slowed a bit when focusing, but I must say that the objets were moving. The weight of the lens is ok, not too heavy, construction seems according to Canon standards. When shooting in particular situations, the silent USM mechanism is really a welcome feature. Overall, a very nice lens for the serious and amateur photographer 
I get frustrated by all the negative reviews this lens gets on the web. Yes, the AF is slow and the IS is first generation. Yes, it's not totally sharp and it's slow at the long end. But what other $440 (inc shipping) 300mm lenses with IS is there? * The DO costs $1100 and is shorter but heavier and the optics are not much better. * The 100-400L costs $1400, is much larger and just as slow. * The 70-200/4L is 50% more expensive, only 200mm and lacks IS. * The new 70-300 IS that replaces this lens will probably be a better lens than this version but it costs 50% more and currently (Oct 05) is still not available in the US. The 75-300mm IS is my zoo lens so I don't use it nearly as much as my standard zoom for everyday photography. On my Digital Rebel with its 1.6x crop factor this lens is the equivalent of 120-480mm in 35mm terms, and with the image stabilization feature it makes for some exotic optics. Play to this lens' strengths (middle of the aperture range [don't be afraid of higher ISO settings to achieve this] and not the extreme long end) and your images will be able to be printed at 8x10 without an issue. You're not going to be able to easily track a speeding cheetah with this lens but that is not what this lens is for. It's also unfair to compare this lens to L series alternatives - if you can afford L series lenses then use them but don't cut those of us down without your disposable income just for enjoying this lens. If you own this lens and you want to improve the quality of your images remember to always use a lens hood. Also, the IS is amazing but there are limits; a monopod will improve image sharpness no end. But both these tips apply equally to most lenses both cheaper and more expensive. This lens has earned a permanent place in my camera bag. It's cheap enough and light enough to carry just in case you might need a strong telephoto. The IS really works and is really useful on a telephoto with this kind of zoom range. Don't be put off or intimidated by lens snobs and line counters. This lens also holds its value well; buy it, and use it, now while you're saving for your L dream telephoto and you will be able to sell it for not much less than you paid for it when the time comes to upgrade. When that time comes you just might decide that you want to keep the 75-300mm IS around as well. This lens is great value and very useable even if it is not a great lens. 
Yes due to be released in Sept 05 is an updated NEW version of this lens. It will be a 70-300mm f/4-5.6 lens with a new IS set up which can be viewed at the Canon Website. The Canon item number is 0345B002. The MSRP of the NEW VERSION LENS is $649.99 I have the older version 75-300mm III USM w/out IS and I have had nothing but good things to say about that lens! (I only paid $189.99 for it) Can't wait for this new version to come out 
For anyone considering this lens, according to Canon's site, there will be a newer model to supersede this one which will out perform it. Item # 0345B002 will be a 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens available at sometime in 9/05 
This lens has gotten some bad reviews, I think, partly because it is starting to show it's age. This was the first USM IS lens, and the technology has REALLY grown since then. If Canon were to come along with an updated 75-300 USM IS lens, man, it would blow everything away. That being said, yes, this lens IS a little slow to focus. But, if you are not using it for work like one of the professional sports photographers you see on the sidelines at baseball games, you should be okay. It also could use an extra stop (or two, or three!) because when you are handholding, you need that aperture to be as open as it can be. All of this aside, I really have gotten some gems of pictures out of this lens. It lets you get as closer then you possibly could hope for. If you have asteady hand and plently of availible light, you can get some really nice shots. If you are in a low light situation... you will need a tripod. The IS of lens works... pretty good, but I have had a number of ever so slightly blurry pictures that wouldn't have been had there been some more aperature room to play with. All in all, its a good starter telephoto lens, especially for digital SLRS since it really extends the zoom on those. Its great for the price, and when you decide to upgrade to one of those white canon L beauties, just sell it 
I cannot help but giggle when I saw comments like "great lens for the money". It is selling for $440 at here, even on so-called clearance. However, one can easily find the same lens at least $50 cheaper at some decent online camera store, such as B, ritz camera, etc. Sad Amazon.. 
Owned 2 weeks: The only thing to cause me to stop short of 5 stars is the weight of the lens. Stabilization is great and worth every dime. Don't even think about the other 75-300mm non-IS version, it is junk - I tried it. You can hand hold this lens at 300 mm at 1/60!! No kidding. Focus is fast and accurate with my Digital Rebel - almost no hunting like on the other 75-300mm. You *must* get a skylight filter to protect the front element. I'll update this review after a few months' use. 
First of all it took me a few months to decide on what lens to buy because I did so much research. My choices were between Canon 70-200L 4, 70-200L 2.8 and the 70-200L 2.8IS. After much investigation I opted not to buy the 4.0 because I knew that I would be shooting in dim lights and needed the 2.8. So to save money I bought the 2.8 NON IS. The lens is great and I travelled to Utah with it. All was great until I tried to shoot a deer at full zoom. Every one came out blurry and could not use. Apart from that it is a fantastic lens. As a result I decided to fork out for the 2.8 IS lens and it is amaizing. It has the same optics as the non IS but handheld the IS really works great. Like on some of the reviews it does not make every shot in focus but certainly most of them and the picture quality is amaizing. Fast focus, great colours. Fantastic. If you can afford it buy it and the IS is def worth it because the lens is heavy and you do shake a bit, which is noticeable at full or close to full zoom. Hope this helps 
I shoot with a Canon 20D and have used the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 III USM lens. I've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball. I reviewed the lens lineup at the Canon website and decided on the Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L USM Lens. The 100-400mm is a great lens, but it can be a bit soft. For that reason I decided to add the Canon EF 70-200mm 2.8/f IS USM telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection. Being an L lens, there are numerous features and its manufactured with high quality materials and a higher level of dust and moisture resistance compared to the standard line of lenses. This is a pro quality lens meant for serious photographers. The construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups. The four Super UD-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration. An improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image. The Canon EF 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs/1,470 g, and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft/1.3 m. This lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x II and 2x II. Be sure to get a good quality UV haze filter to protect the front lens element. Being white, this lens looks a bit strange, but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun. Some people are concerned that being white, it attracts attention to criminals. From my experience, my 20D attracts attention regardless of what lens I put on it. In addition, I most likely have a camera bag and tripod/monopod with me to further attract attention. I personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload. I try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up. The dual IS system has two modes. Mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects. It is recommended that the IS function is not used on a tripod; however I have used it on my monopod with success. The IS helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle. While there are limitations to what the IS can do, it can give you a few extra stops. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed. This lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. There is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m/4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m/8.2ft to infinity. Included with this lens are the Tripod mount, lens hood, and storage case. The tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod. This helps to balance the load. Mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over. The case is a zippered soft case (LZ1324) that can also be purchased separately. The lens hood (ET-86) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations. Often times, Amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood, however they are normally included with the lens. The Canon EF 70-200mm is such an awesome lens, it almost fails to compare to the Canon EF 75-300mm. The Canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me, but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm IS lens is more refined. The auto-focus is quiet and quick. This lens can be used for portraits, landscape, sports or as a general walk about lens. The f/2.8L combined with the IS makes this a good option for certain low light situations. The features add creative versatility. The Canon EF 70-200mm IS lens comes at a price, but it is worth every bit of it. PROS: Incredible clarity and sharpness Quiet and quick auto-focus Features add creative versatility Dual IS system CONS: Heavy and bulky (This should be expected with these types of lenses 
It's a bit heavy but a superb lens. Interior construction has quite a bit of plastic however which is a bit of a concern. I've dropped one onto hard packed dirt/soccer field w/no damage...so it's pretty sturdy :) If you can live with 1 stop less light consider the newly released 70-200 f/4 L IS. This is the new 70-200 f/4 with IS from Canon and will save you some weight if that is a concern 
You know, I researched this lens again and again. I put it on my Christmas list. A year and a half went by and I finally just bought it. My gosh, everything is true! This is one of the world's great lenses. What a piece of glass. With the image stabilization I can take candid shots in a candlelit restaurant using available light. The lens is magical. It captures the soul of its subjects. Nature photography is phenomenal. This is an incredible tool that will take you to a new level. Just do it! No regrets. Honest. 
Nick Xu, if you can't figure out the difference between this lens, and the cheaper consumer grade lenses, by all means, stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses. After all, "Mr Magoo" of cartoon fame couldn't tell a Chevy from a Rolls Royce. All kidding aside, this lens is simply awesome in use. Having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses. Yes, it's that good. I am using a borrowed version right now, but as soon as I pay off my new 24-105 f/4 L IS USM lens (very, very awesome), I will buy my own 70-200 f/2.8 IS USM. It's as good as it gets in this lens range, but if you feel comfortable with a pinhole camera, carry on, as it's all about the end user. For everyone else, this lens is the Holy Grail of mid range telephoto lenses. It is simply the best available in it's range, and responds well to Canon tele adapters. If you can figure out a way to afford this lens, buy it, as it is all that. If you are a Nikon lover buy this lens anyway, and buy a fairly cheap 20D body to make it work. It's OK to tell your friends that you used a Nikon to take the pics, but you will end up knowing that Canon is the premeir lens crafter of the 21'st century. (Sorry, Nikon fans, but this lens stands all by it's self in the grand scheme of things. It's simply awesome.) 
Pros: Superb Retention of Color, bokeh (background blur), sharpness. Fast silent and accurate autofocus. Great Build quality. Cons: Size, weight and price. Not your everyday walkaround lens. Expensive. 
I had read the reviews on this lens and no one had anything bad to say about it. It is fast, crisp, focuses fast, quiet, solid and a bit heavy. The weight is vastly compensated for by all of the positive features. I have used it on my 20D and was just amazed. I just purchased a 5D and cannot believe my eyes. Just a great great lens 
Best camera I've ever owned.It has features found on larger SLR's such as shutter speed red-eye reduction.The several shoot modes such as portrait allows for close ups as well as a scenery mode which allows for sharp vivid photos of foilage as well as sunsets.A marvelous little camera and the size being slightly bigger than a pack of cigarettes allows you to take this anywhere without the bulk of some of the SLR's and their required lens.Too many features to list here.Try one for yourself you'll be amazed 
I love this camera! I did a lot of reading-up and price-checking before I bought this item, and I'm delighted with the quality of product and value for money. This was my first 'own camera' and I've had almost zero camera experience, so to find myself taking the most amazing photos and being able to edit/add text/e-mail them - well - WOW! I've been stunned by the results this camera has given, all within about a month of purchase. The basic handbook had me taking quality 'normal' photo's within 24 hours and, using this handbook I've progressed into some fantastic close-up stuff, and some fun stuff too - get your spouse to dress up for the sepia shots and have a good laugh!! I've had enormouse fun learning with this camera - and I've got loads more to learn and I feel that some good camera work is now within my grasp. This has required a modicom of concentration and diligence, but it's paid off, and is precisely what I had hoped for. I found the batteries that came with the camera were almost useless, but that your quality name-brand batteries give excellent life - also, if you plan on taking more than about 15 pics at a time, you will want a memory card. Oh Yeah! I'm an 'old bird' of 53 years, so if I can do this, ANYONE can :o 
I bought this camera as a gift for my 16 yr old daughter who takes lots of fun pictures of her friends.Her photos are great quality. This is a dependable camera, and takes the abuse a teenager gives it. I love it for all those reasons besides the great pics 
I just finished the first set of pics with this machine and was surprised at the amazing sharpness and the accuracy of the autofocus, not to mention the deapth of field when compared to our older Canon digital camera. Don't be fooled by the low price, however. The 16MB card is a joke, and the batteries are not rechargable. It is best to get a 1GB memory card along with a battery charger pack right away. The price is still very reasonable for such a high quality machine 
I bought this camera owning 2 more digital cameras. One Kodak and another canon (a70). Amazing product... Pro... almost everything.. Cons... no audio on video I definetly recommend the product for the price 
I bought this camera for my 10 year old daughter. She is thrilled to have her own camera and has taken may vacation pics for the family. I would reccommend for all beginning photographers. Great price range with all the options. Plus easy to use 
At the time of this writing, there is something wrong with the product shot on the Amazon site: It makes the lens look much shorter than it is in reality. It's not a large or heavy lens at all, but it's not _that_ short. I've had mine (part of a 20D kit) for about a year, during which I've taken maybe 4000 frames or so with that particular lens. The lens still appears as solid as it was on day 1, so no complaints in that department. The image stabilization (IS) feature works quite well and is surprisingly silent (far more so than the IS system on the EF 70-300mm IS). That said, for a good fraction of the focal length range, IS is a relatively minor (but still useful) benefit of this lens. Autofocus (AF) speed is okay: Better than the kit lens that came with the original Digital Rebel I used to own, but not as fast as some other lenses I have (all non-L). AF accuracy is fine on my copy. Optically, my concern is primarily sharpness. In that department, the lens seems only marginally better than the 18-55mm kit lens that came with the original Digital Rebel (and which can be bought for close to $100, I believe). It's often worth turning off IS to improve things, ironically. Still, it's not awful. I haven't found vignetting, distortion, flare, and aberrations to be significant hindrances. In part, that probably due to a workflow that includes DxO Pro for the images I care about. Overall, I think this is still a pretty good choice for a lens to keep by default on a Canon EF-S camera (30D, 20D, or a Digital Rebel variant). The optical performance over the lower-end EF-S 18-55mm lens is not _that_ great, but the feature set may justify the premium. The higher end EF-S 17-55/2.8 IS is another alternative if you're willing to double your investment and change lenses to get the longer focal range: Its imaging quality and the larger aperture are certainly desirable. Tamron and Sigma have some offerings in this range too, but I'm not at all familiar with them 
i have had so much fun with this lense and managed to take some pretty incredible pics. i use this lense for probably 95% of pics. i have 10-22mm, 28-300mm, and 100-400mm, all of which take great pics but this 17-85mm works great for general use 
The lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility. The stabilization aspect is a great help, although it doesn't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions. Highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the Canon Rebel XT 
I got this lens with my 30D and have found it to be a useful walkaround lens, able to handle just about any situation I threw at it, other than very low-light situations. Even in dim illumination it was able to function fairly well, thanks to the image stabilization, which let me shoot at shutter speeds as slow as 1/4 second hand-held. I wasn't thrilled with the barrel distortion at the wide end of the zoom range, but I was able to fix this using Photoshop's Lens Correction adjustment with no problem. It's simply an additional post processing step that's necessary 
If you are only going to buy one lens for your 10, 20 or 30D then buy this lens. I haven't seen a better general purpose lens out there. The EF-S 17-85mm takes great photos, especially in an action oriented situation where you need to run around a lot and get a variety of different shots at different distances. Some have complained that the lens is overpriced. I agree that for the price, it would have been nice to get a hood and carry bag thrown in, but I can say that Canon has impeccable warranty service. I got sand inside my lens and the autofocus quit while I was shooting photos of military helicopters landing in Iraq. I got the lens repaired and shipped back to me within 30 days - in Baghdad in the middle of a war. I was able to speak to a human tech fairly easily and they even replaced something I clearly broke through heavy use that wasn't covered under warranty. The repaired lens works perfectly. If you're looking for a reasonable alternative on a budget try this lens: Sigma Zoom Super Wide Angle AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC Macro Autofocus Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras Bear in mind that if you have issues and you're using non-Canon lenses on a Canon body, the support you can get from Canon will be limited 
This lens is very versatile, offering good wide angle to a good head-and-shoulders portrait length. It's internal focusing, which helps with speed and close-focusing performance, and has image stabilizer for better low-light performance. The IS can be of a particular benefit to those that shoot in darker open areas, like wedding photographers in churches. The IS, combined with a flash, can allow use to get more background detail for indoor events. No longer do we have to accept dark, dungeon like backgrounds! Ideally, the lens would be a little bit brighter (say, f4 at the top end), and a bit heavier built. But then again, we could have that for $1,000 more 
I got this lens to replace the kit lens that came with my Canon EOS 30D. This lens is definitely a more "substantial " lens than the kit lens. Even though the outer housing is plastic, it has a metal mount and seems very durable and sturdy. The IS really helps to improve the image quality induced by my unsteady hand. The USM is very fast and quiet. I have read accounts of this lens not being able to lock on, but I have not had any issues with it in varying (including low) lighting conditions. I know the lens supports FTM focus, but I have not tried it yet. I like the focal length range on this lens. At 17mm even with the 1.6x multiplier, the angle is very wide. The only drawback to this lens for me is at 17mm there is significant barrel distortion. My test shots my next shot was at 24mm and the distortion was completely gone at this focal length. It's not a showstopper though since it is easily corrected in Photoshop. Of all the lenses I plan to get, (Sigma 30mm 1.4, Canon EF 50mm 1.8 II, and the Canon EF 70-300mm IS USM), this will most likely be the lens I keep on the camera most of the time, using the others as opportunities warrant 
Got it two days ago, and can't say how much I love it. My camera fits perfectly, and I even put my video camera on. Although it doesn't have wheels, I can move the head around in any direction and make it stiff easily. I love the double extensions in the legs and then the neck extensions for the minor adjustments. 
I bought 2 of these to carry a camera support to be suspended over a treadmill for filming from above. I love the fact that they can extend to 70". They are very sturdy and with the hook on the central post I could hang a sandbag for additional support. Furthermore, the support beams from each leg to the central post are attached to a central ring that can tighten to change the size of the base of support as measured by the distance between legs of the tripod. This is extremely helpful when you have limited floor space and tight or cramped corners. With the addition of sandbags, this narrow base of support can still be quite stable. The additional bubble levels on the stand are enormously helpful on rough terrain. The locking mechanims on the legs are plastic, however and are thus not very good for outdoor, dusty conditions. They are very much like the Samsonite 3751 with the same camera release mechanism, locking legs, bubble levels, extendable center post, changeable size of base of support--the differences are: cheaper, greater extension, hook on center post, and carrying case 
I am 6ft tall and this is such a perfect tripod for someone who is a beginning/novice photographer for occasional to moderate use (would be my guess). My fortï¿½ is post-production, as I am a graphic designer and needed something to use with my new dig camera. I did a lot of research for tripods and this seemed to have what I needed for my usage. The plastic clips concern me somewhat with durability for the long haul, but I would love to be surprised and that is just my nerves and luck talking. How can you beat the price regardless? I am so happy with this tripod so far. I love how tall it is for me particularly and how easy it is to use. I did so much research online and found this 70" one and said "screw it" I am tired of looking and bought it. I knew I needed something that accomodated for my height and there isn't a whole lot out there for us tall folks that have decent ratings and is in the hundred and below dept. I didn't have the pesos to make another "hundred+" purchase and took a risk here when I rated the cost versus quality (in my head). I feel as though I have won this battle for now. I like the two "levels" (that i have noticed) to make sure I am squared up on this piece of equipment. Equipment has a smooth pan and I will be using it for my own photo work, video tours for my husband's realtor work and recreation/family photos. I am excited to use this more with my dig Rebel. Legs extend easily. Metal (light weight) body with plastic clips and pieces. Comes with a black bag to hold your tripod also. Easy snap-off piece to remove your digital camera and to attach. In fact I just leave it always on my camera as it expedites the process when I am in a hurry. Tripod feels quite sturdy with my Rebel attached. I think this is a really good-looking tripod. It is so SO light weight and portable. I love that it is NOT clunky and loud to assemble when pulling it straight out of the trunk/car for quickly assembly. I would've liked to seen a manual for recommended usage and ways of maximizing longevity of the product, but I am over it and the product is great so far. (revise 10-09-06) Still LOVE LOVE this tripod. I use it ALL the time. So easy to use and it is SO lightweight and I can just toss it in the trunk. So quick to set up too. Love it ... it ROCKS (from a tall gal). : 
I bought this tripod with the camera bag as a duo deal....When they say Professional, they mean professional. It's a large tripod, easy to telescope out and back again, but heavier and longer, and thicker than other tripods I've used. It does appear to be well made and very sturdy. 
I purchased this as a gift for my brother-in-law. He's over 6 ft tall and wanted a tripod that he didn't have to bend over to use. I couldn't find one locally, and was very happy to find this one online. He's very happy with his gift! Highly recommended 
I was a little hesitant to purchase this tripod because of the low price. The last cheap tripod I bought was lightweight and wobbly. I am very pleased with the performance of this tripod. I wasn't expecting Bogen type quality, but its good enough. It's lightweight, and surprisingly sturdy. I would recommend this tripod to a friend 
I bought this battery for a Canon 30D and can take around a thousand pic's on one charge. Very happy with the battery's performance 
I bought a generic Chinese "equivalent" bp-511 battery that boasted a higher milliamperage rating and a cheaper price than the original Canon battery that came with my camera. The battery worked fine for about 3 months and now only holds a charge for about 20 minutes. I have had it fail at critical times. Never ever buy some knock-off Chinese battery--read the reviews. The Chinese push out their crappy knock-offs to unsuspecting consumers (like I was) just to make a quick buck. Also, don't trust the glowing reviews from the generic sellers. They are self-generated. In my case, the seller is no longer selling under his original company name. He has a new name with the requisite (sham) glowing reviews. CHINESE PRODUCTS SUCK 
Last battery was good for almost 5 years. Easily rechargeable. Couldn't ask for more 
Okay, a lot can be said for saving money, however there can be problems with no-name or non-branded products. No matter what your "style" of photography, you will have a battery empty its charge at a critical moment. Having a back-up is essential. Having a quality back-up battery that will get you through is imperative. Knock-off brands do not hold the same charge as the branded battery meant for your camera; although their manufacture may claim it does. Get in the zone and get the shot! 
For some reason, Canon- branded batteries are better than those sold by actual battery manufacturers. Don't just look at the $$/mAh ratio, consider safety, reliability and longevity. In these categories, the Canons rock. I bought a G1 camera about five years ago, and the camera is toast, but the battery still works like a charm in my 20D. Others start out with 1400 or even 1700 mAh, but fail after six months - read the reviews here on Amazon.com 
I do not trust any batteries except Canon for my Canon cameras. I have found "compatible" batteries do not always charge in Canon charger, and do not last as long on camera 
There are many after market batteries for this camera and every review indicates they are not effective, This OEM battery by Sony delivers the goods, with extremely long lasting power to handle not only the digital picture taking but all the additional flash requirements 
This is an excellent battery that powers my Canon 5D camera very well. Although I haven't tested it against the spec for how many shots I can get from it, I've been very impressed with the longevity of it's charge 
This grip is a great value for the price paid. The batteries alone are worth the money spent. I've banged this around for a week out on the rugged Bruce Peninsula and had no problems with it. I would recommend this to anyone needing a grip. The money you save you can put towards your next lens 
I'm a loyal canon fan who only has 4 Canon branded lenses (though I had a great Sigma 70-300).. That being said, I'm a huge fan of the Opteka grip. The canon is just not worth the extra money. Excellent build quality on it, and the batteries that it came with work very well (more maH than the std battery). I had heard some complaints about how far you had to depress the shutter release on the grip -- it is further than the camera, but very usable, and since purchasing I've heard similar complaints from users of the canon grip. Save the $ on the grip, get the opteka and get other accessories... You wont regret i 
This is the same as the Canon grip, made in the same factory. I don't know how they can get away with it, but it's the consumer's gain here. Through in 2 batteries and your over a hundred bucks ahead---to spend on all those lenses you'll end up getting for the XTi/400D. 
We traded up from the original Rebel to the XTi. This was the first add-on we purchased and has been GREAT! The battery grip adds some balance and overall sturdy-feeling to the Rebel...especially, the slightly smaller XT and XTi bodies. Good stuff, no regrets 
I know it sounds too good to be true, I've read too many reviews where people say that "I never knew how I ever took pictures without this grip," but it's the truth. The first thing I noticed was the vertical handle, it's amazing. You can shoot vertical shots with one hand! All of the buttons you need are on the grip, the shutter button, wheel, and the two buttons on the top right of the XT. Installation, it's a joke, don't even read the manual. You have to charge the batteries, but in the mean time you can put in your regular Canon battery, or 6 AAs because this comes with a AA shell. Think of it this way, the XT is a baby...it's easy to hold if you have small hands; I don't, I knew the camera was small, and I decided to buy this really so I could have a better handle on it, the extra battery life was whipping on the cake. I really don't know how I could stand to hold the camera without this grip. Don't spend extra money on Canon's model, this one is perfect 
I bought the Opteka Battery Pack Grip for my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi, and was a bit leary about the considerably lower price than the Canon brand battery pack grip. I am pleased to report that the Opteka grip has met my expectations. PROS The grip fits extremely well on the Rebel XTi. It even comes with a convenient place to store the battery compartment lid (which must be removed to insert the grip into the camera. Removing the lid is an easy procedure). Attaching the grip is quick and easy, with a large, serrated wheel to tighten the grip against the camera bottom. The finish on the grip is different than that on the Canon-brand grip. The Opteka has a thin, rubbery, texturized non-slip insert layer over the front, bottom and back. The Canon grip's rubbery insert is smooth and looks more "finished." My only concern about the Opteka insert is that it shows signs that it may not stay perfectly attached to the grip, and will likely need a touch of cement in the future. Not a big deal, though. The vertical shooting buttons on the grip (exposure bracket, A-E lock, Auto Focus point selection, selector wheel and shutter release) are, as far as I can tell, identically placed like those on the Canon grip. All work like they are supposed to. The grip comes with an "On-Off" slide so you can turn off the vertical shooting buttons when they are not needed. This prevents accidentally activating one of the buttons or taking a picture if they are inadvertently pressed while shooting horizontal. The battery compartment in the grip is very easy to remove and insert batteries. Although I haven't used it yet, the optional AA battery insert looks easy to use, and is good to have in emergencies. The two NB-2LH batteries that came with the grip seem to be OK, and charged up just fine. With the battery that came with the camera, I now have 3 batteries to use. More than enough for the number of pictures I take during a typical shoot. The grip certainly improves the handling and feel of the XTi, which comes with a too-small grip for many hands. Personally, I like the additional heft and mass the Opteka grip gives the camera, although some may object to the additional weight. CONS This is a very minor point, but worth pointing out. The shutter release button on the Opteka grip is a bit "mushy." What I mean is that it is not always easy to tell when you have pressed the shutter releae halfway down to activate auto focus or metering. There is a noticable tactile difference between pressing the shutter release down on the camera, and the shutter release on the grip. It's as if the spring underneath the camera's shutter release button is a bit stiffer than the one for the grip. However, if you use the viewfinder to determine whether you have achieved focus or not, then the little bit of mush in the grip shutter release won't make no never mind. BOTTOM LINE Would I recommend this grip to a friend? Yes. Would I buy another one if the need arises? Yes 
it was shipd fast and is a verygood buy for the money look the same as the more expensive canon one plus the batterys are good brand i think but it realy up to you the buyer ihave a canon rebel and it fit verrysnug 
I read rave reviews about the Opteka battery grip being manufactured to the same specs as the Canon grip but at a fraction of the price, so I knew I couldn't go wrong with it. It came with two 3rd party batteries as well for only $20 more, so what did I have to lose? Let me start off by saying I have experience with 3rd party batteries and they are usually a waste of money as they are horrible from a performance standpoint. Not these however, I have taken a few hundred pictures with about 20% flash and the battery meter is still full. Great value overall. The grip really does balance out the small size of the Rebel XT and always stays on my camera. It does add considerable weight to the camera however, but nothing overbearing 
I have both the Canon version of the grip and this version. They are identical. I have two Rebel XTs and they work great. I like them for the feel it gives holding the camera. The camera was small in my hands and this makes it perfect. If you are thinking of buying accessories for the Rebel XT, this should be one of them. The grip holds two batteries, which gives you way more shooting time. I highly recommend this 
Well, it's Canon, so there is no doubt about the quality. The only downside -- because it doesn't have a string the cap is very easy to misplace. Always put it in your pocket everytime you remove it from the camera to shoot pictures 
I have the lens, I have the cap....and its been so long since I bought both that I don't remember if the cap came with the lens or not. SURELY it does !!!!!!! I do love my add on lenses but I will have to say that now that I've added all these other toys (macro, wide angle, telephoto, filters) I now realize I shouldve gotten a SLR digital and held out for true lenses instead of the conversion option. I love my S2IS but just think how nice a real camera would be !!!!!! sigh... 
Good quality, and perfect attach, but no cord to avoid loose it. Incredible that Canon forget it!!! So... remember to put it inside your pocket when you use your camera 
Lost your old SLR lens cap? This is what you are looking for. 
I got this lens cap when I ordered a close-up lens for my camera, a PowerShot S1 IS, because it was recommended as something people who ordered that part would also order. I, therefore, assumed that it went with the same camera, or with the lens/adapter I was ordering. However, it does not appear to fit either the camera itself or any of the attachments, so I now wish that I had done some more research to determine whether it would actually fit my equipment 
I'd be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if I said that care of lenses for SLR cameras required a decent lens cap. This one snaps into 58mm threads on the end of many lenses (Canon and otherwise), so just be sure to confirm that that it's the proper size for your lens 
My husband bought me this camera as an early Christmas gift. At first I wasn't in love with it. I was disappointed because I wanted a camera that had image stablization. This camera instead boasted about its ISO sensitivity settings and fast shutter speed. (They claimed it was similar to image stablization) When I first tried it out I was in a very low light setting and was experiencing some blur in my images which was exactly what I was trying to avoid in a new camera! I almost traded this one in for something different (A cheaper priced olympus with IS) but thankfully I gave the camera another chance first and decided to play around with all the manual settings. There are a lot of them in the menus so you can fine tune it like you wouldn't believe. This ability to change its setup is what made me stick with the Sony. However, I wouldn't say this camera is ideal for very low light situations. The two preset choices of shooting a low-light scene without flash won't give you crystal clear pictures especially if you experience a tiny bit of camera shake. But again, it goes back to the adjustments in the menus, you can make manual adjustments and get pretty decent pictures with minumal (or no) blur. But you have to take the time to find and set the right ISO and light settings. I highly suggest using the histogram that you can pop-up onto the screen for help. Unless you are willing to spend about $200 more on a camera, you won't find one that will perform great in very low light anyway. And like my husband said... "really... how often are you taking shots in the dark honey?" Hey, there's Halloween trick-or-treating and fouth of July fireworks and other night time events I retorted, but he's right. There really isn't a lot of real low-light pictures you take where you aren't using a flash. I know lots of people (me included) like to try and figure out all the menu options and settings on their own before reading a manual... but this one, if you really want super amazing shots, reading the manual will give you A LOT of insight on how powerful a camera it really is. For people that always read the manual this is probably a big "DUUUH"! But if you are like me and like to try and rush through and figure it out, you are missing out on a ton of nice options. Some great features: The camera doubles as a video camera and it is only limited to recording up to the amt of space available in your memory stick. Other cameras will only let you record a pre-set maximum number of minutes. I also like the Burst modes which allow you to take shots in fast succession. Great for action shots. But take note, when using a burst mode you cannot use the flash. (Again, watch out for low light!) I have a 3 year old daughter and the fast shutter speed (and burst) works great in a well lit situation. Just the other day I caught shots of her running around and jumping up and down that came out crystal clear. No blur at all. Every flying and bouncing hair on her head came out perfectly frozen in time. Quite neat! I gave this camera 4 stars because the camera performs wonderfully in every situation except very low light. But for the price, you can't do much better anyway. Its a great buy and I think just about anyone would be pleased to receive it as a gift. 
Just be sure to get a case along with it, because the large screen could get scratched 
I had previously owned a Kodak Easy share that died while I was on vacation. I loved the easy to learn and use features on that camera so I wanted another camera that was easy for a non-professional to use. This little camera has been great! I've had it for a few months now and LOVE THE PICTURES! It is very easy to use and is super small which makes it easy to throw in my purse to take anywhere. The pictures are crisp and clear and the battery lasts forever. My old Kodak used to take real AA batteries and I thought a camera with its own little rechargeable battery might be strange but it's actually MUCH easier and lasts way longer than the AA's did in my old Kodak. The LCD screen is huge and makes it very easy to review photos. Just one little click to go to review and back to taking photos. Only two downfalls I've found so far are that the little setting dial moves easily on its own so you have to always check it before taking a picture or it might be on some strange setting or video. The other thing is that I haven't been able to figure out if there is a way to delete all of the photos on the camera after you upload them - I've had to delete them one by one which is a slow process. Other than those two little things this camera is WONDERFUL! Highly recommended 
I am very pleased with this item. The size is right, the resolution of the photos perfect. I am enjoying using the camera 
OK -- allow me to mention that the ONLY thing I dislike is that to charge this camera's battery, you have to remove the battery and put it in a small wall charger. The battery charge seems weak and I have to charge it a lot more than the old one. My last Sony digital camera (a recent one, too) has a plug that fit into the camera and you'd charge it while it sat downloading or just "parked"... I get a bit nervous about opening and closing a battery door constantly. That's what did in a Nikon CoolPix I had. :/ Now that said, I gotta shout - I LOVE this camera. Slim to fit into my pocket or small purse, lens covers when it's off, screen I already have a plastic guard on, and the photos are quality. Hard to take a bad pic with this! I'd say "I'd buy it again!" but I already did -- a gift for my son! Two thumbs up for ease of use, quality pics, and, GREAT price 
I bought this camera two weeks ago, have taken about 100 pics, and my battery is still nearly fully charged. I thought I'd have to buy another battery when I decided to buy this camera, but I'm glad I held off, because it's not necessary (unless you're going on a two-week excursion in the bush with no access to electricity...) No problems with red-eye, no blurry pictures when taken inside with low light, and outstanding battery life. I am getting more than I expected when I purchased this camera. I would recommend it (and show it off!) to anyone 
This is a outstanding camera for it's size. Easy to use, easy to carry and produces great pictures. Would recommend to anyone who is ready to give up film and go digital 
I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05). Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect. There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly 
I almost didn't buy this camera simply because of the plastic body (I'm used to a Praktica MTL3 film camera, which is built like a tank). However, I'm glad I overlooked that because the camera is top-notch in terms of robust features and the quality it provides. Startup time is very quick and making adjustments to shutter speed and aperture is intuitive. If you get the bundle with the kit lens, I highly recommend complimenting it with the very affordable Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens, especially if you are a big fan of DOF and do a lot of available-light / low-light photography. 
I am new to SLRs and I cant belive how good this camera is. This camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces. I always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent, but looking back, they look terrible compared to this. 
This Camera is excellent one!! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category, I'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles.. Highly recommended 
I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin. I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working. The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory. The photos, however, are wonderful. Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable. (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos. 
It is extremely easy to use. Hard to figure out the menu, but once that is done there is no problem. Takes beautiful pictures. Great for action shots as well. Seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in 
When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery. They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes. Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice. So I said no. So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots. Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase. Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button. So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine. as for the quality of photos.....i love them 
I had 2 Rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses. While I had owned other digitals I keep going back to my old Rebel, until now. We got the back up battery pack. My husband and I love it 
This is a great product. I have a rather large lens and it helps stabilize it so that I don't blur my pictures when I'm taking pictures of the kids playing soccer. However, people think I'm a professional photographer from the local newspaper when I use it at the grandkids' games. 
Strong and rigid, easy to control on the head so that you can have it loose for free movement but tight enough that the camera doesn't flop over. Opens and closes very easily. It's kind of expensive for $50 but its probably worth the money 
Solid design, quick and easy to adj height. Great way to steady camera. Doubles as walking stick 
I gave this monopod to my boyfriend, as a gift, and it's been perfect for his use. He videotapes his kids's baseball and softball games, and was tired of holding the camcorder for so long. He didn't want to deal with a bulky tripod when he was getting up and down, so a monopod seemed like a great idea. He has LOVED it!! He says it keeps the camera very steady and it's very easy to change the height so he can use it sitting or standing. He's no professional, but he uses his camcorder a lot, and he'll be happily using the monopod for a long time 
It works fine, but the Canon S2 IS digital camera sometimes feels a little heavy for the monopod. 
I was very pleased with Amazons quick delivery of my new Canon monopod. The monopod is very easy to adjust and use. It's the ideal ridgid support you would want for your camera. It even doubles as a great walking stick, sometime need, on those long treks you make to get a good photo 
This monopod is exactly what I expected at a good price. It extends very smoothly, and the stops hold the leg firmly at the height I set. Easy to set up and adjust with one hand so I can change height with the camera attached 
I love this monopod! I'm a person who uses my camera nearly every day (Canon EOS Elan 7 35mm). This item is one of my favorite accessories for the camera -- so much easier to travel with than a tripod! It's sturdy, but lightweight, easy to use and is very portable. I am mostly using the monopod to support my camera with an enormous, extremely heavy 500mm telephoto lens attached. I'm actually able to hold that huge lens steady with just the monopod -- not one blurry photo! I've dragged it all over the Bluegrass of Kentucky ... across fields of horse farms, and even to the racetrack. I've taken it out into the wilderness to photograph elk. I had to keep closing it down and extending it out every time we got in and out of the vehicle, which was often. Also recently traveled all over Arizona with it to the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Canyon De Chelley, etc. I was constantly opening and closing it, taking literally hundreds of photos (about 14 rolls) with no problems at all. I'm wondering if the other reviewer just got a defective one. I wish I'd bought one of these years ago! I highly recommend it 
If you've found these reviews, you already know this lens is one of the best Canon products out there. I did not bite on the IS version, and I have not found myself ever wishing I did; this lens is everything it's hyped up to be and performs well in low-light/indoor situations. I don't think it's weight is that big a deal. I really don't have any problem carrying this lens around for a day -- in my hands or in a bag -- even with a 1.4 extender attached. It can feel a bit heavy but I don't mind, and neither will you when you see the results later on. I've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it's landed me front page ink several times. In my mind, I could get the 1.4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70-280 range, which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography, considering the 300 f/2.8 and it's friends are much, much more expensive. The lens works basically just as fast and sharp, in my opinion, with the 1.4 at f/4, although some may debate this. Flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro. If you can swing the price, enjoy it! My advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products, although I found most everyone agreed, this is one of the finest lens around. It's one that makes people stop and stare and wonder who you are 
...there are two things that you should know. The first is that the f/2.8 version of this lens is big and heavy. The second is that the f/2.8 version of this lens is the more versatile and, therefore, the more useful of the two choices. Why is the f/2.8 more useful? It allows you to use Canon's outstanding extenders and still have a sharp and practical lens. With the 1.4x, you will have a very, very good 98-280mm f/4 lens. With the 2x, you will have a good 140-400mm f/5.6 lens. In both cases the lens will autofocus--very well with the 1.4x and adequately with the 2x. The use of the Canon extenders also allows the 70-200 to make a pretty nice close-up lens. The original close focus of the lens is maintained with the extenders, giving you both 280mm and 400mm focal lengths that focus closer than most prime lenses of the same focal lengths. While you can use the extenders on the f/4 version, it makes for some pretty slow lenses with limited applications. There's not much you can say about this lens that hasn't already been said. It's one of the sharpest zooms around with a look that, while certainly subjective, is highly appealing. I have a preference for prime lenses over zooms but I still rank this as one of my sharpest lenses. Is there any reason to choose the 70-200 f/4 lens over this one? Cost aside, I can see a valid argument being made for the f/4. Carrying around the f/2.8 in a full camera bag is no fun unless you're putting it to use. Since I mostly use shorter focal length prime lenses, sometimes the f/2.8 is a pain in the neck for me--literally. Unless I know I will need it, I have taken to leaving it behind in favor of a lighter, smaller and less sharp Canon 100-300. So I can see the utility of the smaller 70-200. Maybe I can talk myself into owning both. Nah, that's a little too excessive. 
I forgot my wife's birthday and she subsequently hinted that she wanted a telephoto lens... I started by looking at the cheap ones, but decided, that I might as well do it right if I were going to do it at all. When it arrived, my wife took it out of the box and we were both stunned by how massive this lense was. It's heavier than you might think as well (which means that the mounting ring that come packaged with this lens is an absolute God-send). The first thing we did was go out and buy a Mono-pod for it. Next we took it camping and then water-skiing and ended up with some of the most incredible, crystal clear shots we've ever seen. The autofocus was incredibly fast - I was able to hold down the button and snap through multiple exposures while speeding across the waves. Most of the time - the thing was right on. We then mounted it on a tri-pod and shot family portraits. This was the first time we had all the kids and grandkids together in six years and once again - the lens didn't let us down and the photos were fantastic. I don't have any real training with a camera (I use the Cannon Rebel and auto-focus most of the time) but this lens was worth every dime. ...It also worked to get me out of the dog-house with my wife.. 
I have a few 'L' lens, and this is by far my favorite. Reviews saying this is their favorite lens are not kidding. There are plenty of other reviews going over all the features, but I would like to add to the IS v Non-IS. I purchased the NON-IS version because I did not want to fork over the extra million-dollars for IS. If I knew I was to like this lens so much and it would become my favorite lens, I would have splurged for IS. Somewhere on the great-big-internet I read a comparison between the two versions. The IS version clearly shows less sharpness, but it was not clear if that is only when IS is on. And I'm not sure if it would be noticeable on Digital 
I don't personally subscribe to the notion that the big brand manufacturers always make the best lenses out there, but this is one instance where they really, honestly do. This thing is lightning fast, sharp as a tack, the bokeh is much better than Sigma's equivalent, and you'll have a hard time finding a use for your raw processor's chromatic aberration correcting sliders when coupled with a digital body (you CAN still get some purple fringing around backlit subjects, but genuine CA bad enough to show up in a print has so far proven non-existent for me at any focal length or aperture). The weight is a serious downside, but it's one I can live with. If you're a nature photographer who really has a problem holding still or if you plan on using extension tubes, the IS version might be worth the extra $700 to you, but if you're doing event photography where the subjects are the ones jumping around like rabbits, save your money and your battery power; ain't a thing wrong with this lesser model 
This is probably Canon's best value in a mid/long zoom. I got this the same day I purchased my 30D...along with the EF-S 10-22 and the EF 24-70 2.8L. Talk about pleased! No regrets whatsoever. This lens just screams quality. Images just pop out at you. If you're considering the f/4 model...take a hard look at this one. Add a hood (cha-ching) and (yikes) the $100+ tripod ring and the value of this lens really shows. It's a bit larger heavier but look what you gain! If you're one of those that considers the sweet spot of a lens to be stopped down a step or two just look at where that puts you on the f/4 compared to this one. And the focus speed is nothing short of "holy mackerel that's fast!" Sure, you could spend a few more bucks and get the IS version...but frankly, to me at least, if it's that important I'll be using a tripod anyway. Hmmm, just took the shakes out of the equation. All in all, a great lens at a decent price 
This lens is fantastic very fast .colors that will blow you away.2.8f stop can set very fast sutter speeds .I put this lens on my reble xt and I dont want to take it off. Love it Amazon great......... 
I keep it short and sweet. Very Sharp - quick autofocus. I use it with my Canon 20D. 
my cousin's wife is a professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses to me for clothing / lifestyle photoshoots (I've been pretty active in this area for some time, just now starting to go full digital), and I've used the f/2.8L about four or five times and this is one of the best lenses I've used. period. shooting wide open allows you to retain high shutter speeds for night shots, as well as get very interesting and vibrant long shutter shots (of crowds, the freeway at night, etc). when shooting action shots, the tripod mount can get in the way of zooming and focusing, but it can be removed easily enough. I personally just purchased the f/4.0L, which, coupled with a relatively wide max aperture and shooting at either 1600 or 3200 on my 20D, should do nicely, but I still rate the 2.8 high up on my list 
Good quality product which actually measured slightly larger than indicated providing room for a good sized zoom lens. As usual Amazon shopping beat all others for pricing 
I'm not sure why "rkm001" had so many issues with this product. I have owned one for about two months now and use it very heavily. It cuts a straight line for me everytime and I have never had something "stick" to the cutting strip. I actually bought this one to replace a very worn (and more expensive trimmer/cutter) I had for years, and wish I had done it sooner 
It performs as you'd expect. The bar holds the paper in place, and the cutter cuts the paper. I also got the perforating and scoring blades, and those also work very well. Using the cutter and perforator, I've made several custom-size notebooks with tear-out pages 
Excellent product, easy to use, great for edging cards and making trims for cards and craftwork. I can't wait to experiment with it 
Clearly "rkm001" has had some difficulty in using this equipment. I have one that I used as part of my job. I have probably cut over 1000 photos/labels/etc. Other people in the office have cut more than 2000 photos. It does exactly what it is supposed to do - it cuts a straight line along the edge of the guide. Where this problem arises is when the cutting surface, underneath the cutting wheel, becomes worn from use. I grove will slowly develop and since the cutting surface is not fixed in position and can slide from side to side, the grove will not be straight nor will it be parallel to the cutting guide. To solve this problem, you should not use extreme force when cutting. Gentle pressure is adequate for cutting a photo. You can also remove the cutting surface and rotate it 90 or even flip it over. This gives you four cutting surfaces to work with. Ultimately you will need to replace it. Carl makes those too. For $20, it works well and unless you plan to cut thousands of times a month, it is fine for home or light office use 
When digital cameras first came out, I, like many people swore I'd always be loyal to film. Digital could never take the place of film. I'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely. There's still something I love about putting a roll of film in the camera, shooting away, sending the film to be processed, and seeing the results. I also know it's a bit expensive. I know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion, but digital cameras are improving in this regard, and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving, we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital SLR and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera. So I figured now is the time to get a digital SLR. I have been a loyal Nikon user for nearly ten years, and have owned the Nikon N60, N70, and N80. My first love was, and still is the N70 (I've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought I was the only person who loved the N70). I purchased the N80 only after my N70 cost too much to repair, but I've enjoyed the way my various Nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if I don't have the time to use specific controls, but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes. My Nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes, wildlife shots and all sorts of other things I can't resist to capture forever. I decided to purchase the D70 since it was close to what I've already experienced with Nikon. In many ways it works in a similar way to the N70 and 80, except it's a digital rather than film version. Like the film versions of the midrange Nikon SLR's, it has a dial that allows an automatic setting, portrait, landscape, sports, close-up, nightscape, and night portrait modes, the ability to select aperture, shutter speed or manual controls. The camera has auto and manual focus abilities. Photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires. The controls are easy to use, though it takes practice to be comfortable. On a personal level, the camera has passed the Halloween test, niece's birthday test, and fall foliage in New England test and favorite scenic spots test. The only real difficulty I've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting. Auto focus has not worked at all and I'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots, but at this point I'm sure it's the photographer and not the camera. I do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera. The manual is very confusing. It uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else. I've had luck with the "Magic Lantern Guides" with my other cameras, but have not as of yet used it for this camera. I did purchase the NIKON D70 FIELD GUIDE (David Busch, Wiley Publishing) which has been helpful. It can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with Nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography. 
I've had my D70s for about a year now, haven't regretted it for a second. The controls are laid out logically, with everything to hand. The dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate. I personally love the optional grid overlay, I have no excuses for horizons that aren't horizontal. The wireless flash system is great, though you have to buy an SB-600 or SB-800 to get the full benefit. This camera is bigger and heavier than the D50 and D80, which in my opinion is a positive thing. 
I am a professional photographer, and I have owned this camera for nearly two years. I also have a D70 for backup. The batteries go forever, it is very quick to respond, the images are beautiful, and it has the typical Nikon durability and reliability. If you are already a Nikon user, the controls will fall easily to hand. That having been said, the computer software with this camera is a joke. For the best image quality shoot RAW files, color balance with a grey card, and render the images with software like Capture One LE. The uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars. Come on, Nikon, be real!!! Shortly after I got my first D70, I shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog. I got an ugly feeling in my gut when I was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure, cropped to the head and shoulders, and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog. By the time I found out, it was already at the printer. As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great. After that incident, I have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results. This camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button. In resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera. It is imperative to shoot RAW and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera. I can't wait to try the D80 
I do weddings, portrait, and outdoor photography and I don't see any reason why I'd ever switch from the D70 (other than the D80 :). This camera is professional grade at the consumer price point. Don't be scared by the 6.1 MP. I print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems. I'd recommend reading Thom Hogans manual 
The D70s is a minor update of the original D70 introduced in 2004, with a few new features and a slightly larger LCD. It's still a great camera, but expect it to be replaced by the new D80, which has 40 percent more pixels, a 2.5-inch LCD, and additional useful features at the old price of the D70s. So, you can probably save a little money and still purchase a sophisticated digital SLR if you wait until prices of the D70s stabilize at a new, lower level. At, say, $600, this camera would be an incredible bargain. The D70s has shined as one of the best cameras in its class since its introduction. For example, it has a 1/500th second flash synch speed (found in no other camera but the D50) so you can keep ambient light under control and avoid ghost images. Its autofocus is fast and accurate, and features both single-autofocus, continuous-autofocus (for tracking action), and a novel "automatic" autofocus mode that switches between AF-S and AF-C as required. If you have no Nikon lenses, get this camera with the 18-70mm kit lens, which is very sharp and versatile, rather than the more limited 18-55 lens. You won't regret it 
Excellent camera kit. Versatile. I have a lot to learn about the camera, though, as it is no simple point-and-shoot. However, in Auto mode, it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. I look forward to learning how to use it fully. Lenses came with warranty cards, but the camera itself did not. I bought the SB-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 GB compact flash cards to round out the kit. Camera with lens attached is large, which I underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. Great camera, though. Price was the best I could find anywhere 
It has a learning curve, that's for sure, but WOW! This camera is worht every penny, far more stable then the comparable Canon Rebel, and the product comes with better lenses. The quality of glass DOES matter 
I bought this grip a year ago after shooting homecoming weekend at my school, Central Michigan University. The pain it saved my wrist being able to shoot sports vertically without having to hang my hand over the top of my camera was a HUGE relief. Recently though, after a year of solid use, I've been having problems with it. There will be days that my camera will suddenly say my batteries are dry - after charging them the day before. I've checked, and my grip is not part of the series that was recalled for a similar problem. I have to actually removed the grip, and the batteries, and restart the camera to correct the problem. --this is a big problem in the middle of a sports match-- However, the grip is a great addition to the 20D/30D models. It's not the same feel as using a 1D, but it's as close are you're going to get. And for $150, you can't go wrong with the vertical shooting and doubled battery life. It also simply evens out the weight of the camera, especially with the heavier L-glass lenses on your camera 
I appreciate the difference in balance the battery grip provides for long lenses. The E-1 hand strap that can be attached with this addition provides a very solid, secure grip. Also, the BGE2 comes with a carrier for 6 AA cell batteries for those instant dead battery emergencies 
I just received the Canon BGE2 Battery Grip yesterday and already have it attached to my EOS 30D (nice). The unit fits very well and is very secure. I had no trouble aligning and tightening the Grip to the Camera Body. I also found the additional shutter release very handy. In addition, the shape of the unit allows a solid "grip" in the Vertical orientation as well. I too already had an extra battery pack, as TWO Batteries are required. Please note that the unit COMES WITH the Canon BGM-E2 Battery Holder, which allows you to use AA batteries. There is NO NEED to buy this as an accessory (unless you want a second AA battery magazine). One accessory that compliments the Battery Grip very well is the Canon Hand Strap E1. This Strap is designed to work with the neck strap yet provides added security and control with the Battery Grip (and well worth the $25-$30) 
I had the similar battery grip for my Dig Rebel, and I never took it off the camera. So as soon as I bought the 30D, I immediately ordered this. The dual batteries allow me to do an entire wedding (close to 1000 shots) without ever having to switch batteries. Plus it really improves the grip of the camera with heavier/longer lenses. It has worked very well for me, and is a breeze to install 
I just attached my battery grip to my 300d for the first time today, and the difference was amazing. I already had an extra battery pack, so I charged them both up and slid them in right away. The added weight is a very nice addition to the 300d's small body, and I can already see an improvement in my ability to hold the camera still. It also makes the camera feel much sturdier. I have seen a few reviews that complain about the fitting. I have not had that problem. The connection is seemless for me, and there is no shimmy what-so-ever when I have a 70-300 lens attached with the camera on a tripod. So maybe this accessory was optimized for the XT? I love the extra shutter button as well, it makes taking picture in the portrait orientation EXTREMELY comfortable and easy. The buttom is almost exactly the same as the actual shutter on the camera as well, which makes it easy to go from button to button. After reading all the hype on this accessory, I forced myself to buy it, and I was not dissapointed! I recommend it to anyone using the XT. Buy it now or else 
Although people had problems with the first generation of this grip, I've been completely satisfied with mine. Recently, I've been shooting with a 300 2.8L, and it would be much more difficult without the extra length the grip ads to the body. Similarly, the second set of buttons for vertical shooting makes a big difference, too. (One note: when shooting vertical, it is hard to actuate the thumb wheel and impossible to use the joy stick--which I do frequently to change focus points--without moving my right hand.) By holding two batteries, the grip also keeps me from worrying about running out of juice during high volume shooting sessions. The grip still has a little flex in it, but I've never had any of the power problems that I've read about here and elsewhere 
I recently purchased this for use with my 550EX. If you use alot of flash for event photography, you will want this in your kit. It is expensive, but I think it is worth every penny. It will keep you from changing AAs in your strobe and it quickens the recycle times to nearly instant. You can shoot bursts and still get the proper flash exposure. You can attach a strap to sling it over your shoulder or slip it on your belt. Mounting on my 20D was just not comfortable. It gets in the way of the hand-grip 
I'm very happy with the product and would recommend it to my friends. Your service is also excellent 
Recycle times fantastic. Batteries seem to last forever. Much less expensive than the alternatives 
Yes, it's overpriced, just like any specialty item. And yes, the screw attachment to the bottom of the camera is useless. But when you need fast recycle times or hundreds of flashes at a go, the CP-E3 is invaluable. You can strap the case to a light stand or flash bracket, and the coiled cord length is adequate for these uses. I use the elegantly compact Really Right Stuff flash bracket which has no place to attach the CP-E3, so the battery back without its case slips into my shirt or pants pocket. The case could also be strapped to your belt. The unit is a little weighty with 8 rechargeable AA batteries aboard, and I'd hate to see how many pieces this plastic gizmo would break into if I dropped it on a hard surface. On the top is a tunnel for a strap to hang it from something, and a strap should have been included. I made a loop from some hiking boot shoelaces (from which I also make zipper pulls) and I hang it from a knob on a light stand when shooting with a studio set-up. Without the short recycle times the CP-E3 allows, my 580EX flash would have gotten only one shot of my daughter bowing after playing her piece at a piano recital. Instead, I got three. Decide for yourself how important that kind of thing is 
Got this for my 580EX flashes for shooting weddings. Works great and recycle times are excellent. It will last an entire event filled with 2500mAH batteries 
I'm using the CPE3 with my 20D and 580EZ. I'm shooting over 500 wedding flash shots before I notice any slow down in the recyle time. Recycle is about 3 seconds after a full discharge and hardley noticeable for anything less. I am using "Digital" brand 2200 mAh NI-MH batteries. The Pack uses 8 batteries to recharge the flash capicitor while the 4 batteries in the flash are running the flash electronics. I am very happy this combination. By the way I'm using the Stroboframe Pro-RL flash bracket and it great. The battery pack of the CPE3 straps right to the bracket 
I bought this because I needed top recycle speed from my 550EX flash unit without spending a huge bundle. I shoot karate demos with my EOS Rebel digital, lots of fast action in a rather large space (meaning many full power flashes). With the digital Rebel set to ISO800 mode and the flash set to +1 stop exposure I can adequately cover the action in a basketball court sized gymnasium. Using this battery pack with 2000MaH AA sized batteries (about 6.50 for a set of 4 at walmart) I've taken over 400 pictures with no slow down in cycle speed. This particular pack uses 8 AA cells and is compatible with Lithium ion cells. The older version of this unit used 6 cells I believe, and was not compatible with Lithium ion batteries. The unit is very simple. A box with a light on it, a space for a strap (though none is included) a slide out battery tray with locking button and of course the connector with a coiled cord that hooks into the side of the flash unit. I'm sure they do it for reasons of resistance, but the cord is kinda short, thus limiting you to where you can hang the battery package. If your tripod socket is free they do include a screw designed to mount the battery package to the bottom of the camera (kinda useless if you ask me). The battery box comes with a fairly nice padded nylon case that includes a velcro strap, this is what I use to hang the battery package from a camera or bag strap and it works fine. Eventually I'll get around to finding something I can use for a strap as that will worry me less (with 8 batteries in this thing it's a bit heavy to be trusted to velcro if you ask me). The unit works the way it's intended but I think the price is exhorbitant for a hunk of plastic, the price should be about half what it is. If you can't go all-out and buy the top end with the rechargeable battery or a true professional (what they used to call 512) battery package then this is enough for most of us 
I am not a professional photographer, but I wanted high quality lenses to go with my Canon 10D (which I may upgrade soon). I researched for over a month before purchasing this lens, and I have not been disappointed. I only wanted to carry around two lenses, so I purchased this one, and the Canon-EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultrawide Zoom Lens. I have found this combination works very well for me. My uses include photographing landscapes, wildlife, sports events, and my family. The speed and quietness of the autofocus is outstanding, and the zoom doesn't compromise the quality of the prints. Even though the price is high, you really do get what you pay for in lenses. 
I love EF 70-200 f/4L USM Telephoto Zoom lens. The price is right, super quality of pictures in color and contrast. It is light weight about 1.5 pounds in comparing with its siblings, 70-200 f/2.8 with or without IS (about 3.5 pounds). I am think about to buy the new model 70-200 f/4L with IS. With IS, I can take pictures in lower light conditions, which I could not do it with my 70-200 f/4L. 
My first L lens. Very sharp and solid build. With Canon DR and Amazon GC, you can get it in lower $400!! 
At first, I had a selection of third-party lenses. Nothing bad, just none that were spectacular. I was somewhat disappointed in the shots I got. Then I bought the 85/1.8 and saw the contrast and colors I was expecting. Since then, I've bought several Canon lenses and this one is my latest. Like the title says, WOW. My first shots were in the house and around it and at all apertures and zoom lengths, the shots are simply incredible. Just fantastic sharpness - no PS USM needed! The colors are real and vibrant and the contrast is sharp and clear. This (and my 24-105/4L) is what lenses SHOULD be. Well built, solid and great glass. Sure, you do pay more. And you could enhance your shots with PS. But to see the results from these lenses vs the cheaper alternatives, you'll see what you spent all that money for! I'm sold on Canon 
This is a great lens, amazingly sharp. Only thing I would say is if I had the money the 2.8 IS version would be even better and certainly something I'll consider as an upgrade in the future. Use a fast shutter speed or mono/tripod with this thing. Anything below 250/sec gets to be a problem at 200mm 
Like the Canon EF 17-40 f4L USM, this is it's sister and $100 cheaper to boot! Excellent images at f4! Outstanding images at f9. A lightweight combination with the Canon 5D. An even lighter and more compact combination with the Canon Digital Rebel XT. The only gripe I have is having to purchase the optional and expensive tripod collar ring. The ring does add a bit of noticeable weight. Since I am not a steady shooter, I will be upgrading to the Canon EF 70-200 f4L IS USM when it is available in November this year. At least the tripod collar ring should fit on the newer weathersealed lens. 
Like many people my decision on a telephoto zoom lens came down to buying the Canon 70-200mm f/4L or the Canon 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM. The trade offs seemed clear at first. The former performs slightly better (see Canon website for MTF data), is better designed built, is faster and has the "L" lens status. User comments and ratings (at more than one site) are slightly more favorable for the L lens. The 70-300mm has an improved IS and of course a longer focal length. Both cost about the same so money was not a factor in my decision. I eventually decided on the L lens and was initially disappointed. Photos ranged from wonderful to not very good at all. In fact, I almost returned the lens. Eventually I figured out the problem. My yard is heavily shaded so most of the initial photo's were taken in low light and I had selected shutter speeds that were too slow. To avoid camera shake you need to shoot at the reciprocal of the focal length or faster. Sounds simple but with the Digital Rebel XT (which I was using) you need to consider the camera's 1.6 multiplication factor. So at 200mm you need a shutter speed of 1/320 or faster not 1/200 like I initially thought. Once I made the speed adjustment things changed for the better. Still I have some mixed feelings about my decision. When the light is good this is a fantastic lens but with the IS feature offered on the 70-300mm I would probably get photos that I will miss with this lens.  I can't fault the performance of this lens for its limitations and I have given it 5 stars. In other words it does what it is supposed to do very well but my message to other buyers is to consider where you are most likely to use the lens before buying. Remember IS becomes increasingly important as you extend the focal length. If your camera is already extending it by a factor of 1.6 you may find IS a very attractive feature. (Note the 70-300mm has a recall on certain model numbers because of problems when using the lens in a portrait position.) By the way, I purchased from Amazon and it was a flawless transaction 
I agree with the previous review. The deluxe blower brush just left more dirt in the camera because the hair of the brush is falling out 
This is the lens I use most often. It is unbeatable for portraits and low-light photos indoors etc. It is very sharp and relatively light and small. I have also found it useful for aerial photography. I used to have the 50 mm 1.8 but upgraded because I like the extra low-light power of the 1.4 (which I often use) and the one-touch USM manual focus with distance scale (which is just a nice-to-have). That said, the 1.8 is a great lens too 
This is a wonderful lens with great image quality, very fast, and very good build quality. No complaints 
What can you say, other than it's 4 times cheaper than the 50f1.2L. Not an L, but a great bright fast quiet lens, small and optically superb. On a crop camera it's a 80mm portrait lens. Super 
This lens is great. I've been doing portraits and just random snapshots and it makes every picture beautiful! The only downside is the lack of ability to zoom. Other than that it's a great lens 
After reading a number of on-line reviews, I bought this lens a few weeks ago straightly for its low-light photography capability. What I have gotten is a little more than I have bargained for. The pictures it produces have made a casual hobbyist like myself look like a pro, at least in the admiring eyes of unsuspecting acquaintances. Now only if I have the heart to mumble-jumble a few far-fetched jargons, I might have a new packing order firmly in place. When paired with my Rebel XTi, the 80mm effective focal length and wide apertures make it an ideal portrait lens. It is also compact, light-weigh and solidly built, has fast and acurate auto-focus, and most importantly, has superb optical qualities. The best part is I have gotten these without breaking the bank nor does it break my neck hauling it around. However, despite its low-light capability, the very attributes that make this lens outstanding for portraits, i.e., narrow angle of view and shallow depth of field at wide apertures, make it an odd choice for in-door group photos. Also if you are taking action shots, the 80mm focal length may not be long enough to provide a safe distance to avoid mishaps. Instead of being a distal observer, I have found myself an unwilling participant in the middle of the action ducking the camera from the ever-curious tongues of my Golden Retriever and her playmates. No wonder zoom lenses are so popular. What else is there not to like about this lens? Not much unless you are a proud owner of one mammoth of an expensive L prime lens. Well, it does come with a free hood and that wonderful soft leather pouch, doesn't it 
The lens is great! I'm using it on my EOS 20D, and the shots are beautiful. At the wide open setting (1.4), the depth of field is amazing and provides an absolutely outstanding boquet. This lens is definitely worth the difference in price over the 1.8. The boquet is much better. A little advice: avoid using the auto focus on your camera when using this lens... its too easy to catch any little thing in front or behind what you are intending to focus on, and you WILL see a difference, with just a small difference in depth. Manually, the lens will provide you with perfect shots every time! And its well worth the extra few seconds to make sure the shot is composed correctly 
The latest 50 f/1.4 EF lens is the best performing chunk of glass that any photographer can buy for anywhere near the price. Granted, the 50 1.8 lens is awesome for it's dirt cheap price, but it is outclassed by the f/1.4 in all respects. Others have already raved about the virtues of this cheap (not really) lens, so I'll just agree with with the strong points, and lay out the broad picture on an open table. First, the 50 f/1.8 is usually a fine lens. It is dirt cheap, has better quality control than anything built by Sigma, and is super light weight. That being said, it does have issues with lens to lens quality, it is "only f/1.8", has a plastic lens mount, and is pretty slow in AF. The 50 f/1.4, on the other hand, can darn near allow you to see in the dark through the viewfinder, can focus in total darkness with the right shoe mount flash, records tack sharp images at most all apertures, has great contrast, is light in weight, small in size, has a metal lens mount, and is pretty cheap to buy. It is NOT an L lens in construction, yet it offers L lens optical quality. It does have a USM, but it is the "old style" USM, and is not as fast as the modern ring type USM lenses. Still, it is very fast, it beats the speed of the throw away f/1.8 lens to death, and is pretty darn quiet. Also, despite the majority plastic build, and lack of distance data for E-TTL II flashes (the f/1.8 also lacks this feature) the f/1.4 lens does offer a very responsive full time manual focus ring that works like a charm for manual focus, or just touch up in difficult auto focus situations. This lens is all that, and everyone should own it as their first lens. Zoom lenses included in body/lens kits are just plain junk (sorry), but this lens will stay in your camera kit for decades, no matter what camera body is in your future. People who are using 1.6 crop factor cameras like the 20D, 30D, and Rebel line should bear in mind that the 50 f/1.4 lens is effectively an 80 mm f/1.4 lens when mounted on their cameras. That makes the 50 f/1.4 an awesome portrait lens, and the aperture and diaphragm design of the f/1.4 make it unbeatable for capturing shallow depth of field shots with pleasingly blurred backgrounds. As fine a lens as the 50 mm f/1.8 really is, it cannot begin to compare to the 50 mm f/1.4 lens in terms of functionality. Buy this lens today, and it will be with you until the end, no matter what Canon body you use in the future. If you use a 1.6 crop factor camera today, this lens will become a favorite, and the best 80 mm portrait lens you have ever owned. As always, use it with the factory lens hood at all times (only about twenty five bucks), and use a UV filter that is multi coated on both surfaces at all times. Anyone who suggests that you use a cheap filter is steering you down the wrong path. No matter what lens you buy, always use a UV filter that is built at least as well as your lens. Cheap filters, and filters that are not multi coated on both surfaces are just plain garbage. The shame of it is that even Canon offers garbage filters for cheap, and many people who spend hundreds of Dollars on a lens claim that "If it's good enough for Canon, it's good enough for me". Nonsense. A cheap filter is just that. A good lens with a cheap filter might impress, but a good lens with a great filter WILL impress. Don't fall into the cheap trap 
When I worked as a photojournalist many years ago, 50mm was the "standard" lens in that it came closest to a real world perspective, especially for street photography. That is no longer always true because of the field-of-view crop of many cameras. Canon's popular digital Rebel and its successors, for example, have a 1.6X view that turns a 50mm lens into an 80mm lens. The 1D MARK II has a 1.3X view that makes it a 65mm lens. So, if you're looking for a standard lens today, 35mm probably is closer to the mark on those cameras. And Canon has a couple of options there - a 35 f/1.4 that is great and expensive and a 35 f/2 that is a good value at about $250. If you're still looking for a 50mm, however, there now are four options from Canon: 50/1.2, 50/1.4, 50/1.8 and 50/2.5. Here are the pros and cons of each: 50/1.2 is the newest, fastest and the most expensive at about $1,600. It is an "L" lens, which means it is more durably constructed than any of the others. The image quality is a cut above all of the others, especially at wider apertures. If money is no object, you'll probably want this one. But most of the rest of us have to ask the question whether it's 5X better than the 1.4. 50/1.4 is maligned by some for the softness of its images at f/1.4, but for me its a good, compact, low-light lens at a terrific price ($325). And the lens gets sharp quickly as you stop it down. It's sharp at f/2 and very sharp by f/2.8 with good contrast and colors. 50/1.8 is a step down from the 1.4 in speed, image quality, build quality and the smoothness and noise of its autofocus. But it is a big step up in value - a decent lens for about $80. If you're just getting into digital photography, this is a great lens to learn on until you get a better feel for the lenses that you want/need. 50/2.5 - this is a macro lens, although you can use it for general photography, too. I wouldn't recommend it. If you're doing macro photography, spend a little more for the 100/2.8, which is a sharper lens that gives you more subject distance. If you're looking for a standard lens, you'll appreciate the wider aperture of the 1.4. All that said, of the 50mm Canon lenses, I think the 50/1.4 still offers the best mix of image quality and value. 
This is an awesome lense, especially for the money. I would still purchase this one. There is nothing second rate about it. However, Canon has a new L series version on their website as does B H photo. It is a 50 mm NORMAL EF f/1.2 L USM for 1599. 00. I heard of photographers who shoot whole weddings with this one 3 hundred dollar lens 50mm lens. 
This monopod is very sturdy and easy to set up. I was looking for a monopod that was capable of handling the weight of my large Canon lens (over 3 lbs), and this one does the job very well. I mainly use it for taking soccer pictures, and so far, I'm very pleased. I highly recomend it 
This is a very good product, the price is cheap, come with the bag which is a plus, if you are looking for a cheap but sturdy monpod, this is the right one, highly recommanded 
Sure, this isn't a pro mono pod and it doesn't have a mobile head but for the money it's great. Easily holds my Olympus E1 with 50-200mm lens. Great as a walking stick as well. Stores tight and light. Highly recommend this product. I may just get a back up 
I use this monopod for my pentax optio w20 camera and for a panasonic video camera. I use it when camping and it doubles as a sturdy walking stick. When I'm out in the wilds people think it's a walking stick until they see my small camera perched on top of it. It has really improved my ability to stay steady and blur free with my new pentax which has no optical viewfinder. I like the quick adjustment legs as opposed to screw type. I've also used this tripod to stick my video camera out of my sunroof to cruise through New England to catch the Autumnal leaves while driving which has given some interesting results. I plan to do the same thing on Rt 1 to film the big sur highway. The only thing I need to get is a ball head to adjust the angle of the camera. For the price this was a steal and a hearty deal 
The Optika MP100 Pro Photo Monopod is surprisingly sturdy, functional and well-made. It is supplied with a reasonably decent quality zippered nylon case with carrying strap. No, it is not "professional grade", but it is something every amateur photographer can use for weekend shooting. I've used it both with digital still and camcorder, where it offers respectable improvement in long-distance shots (versus trying to hold the camera still, or propping it up on the roof of the car, a not-nearby-enough fence post, and so on.) Certainly a LOT handier than the old tripod! I bought two, keeping them ready-for-action in the trunk of my cars. Highly recommended 
Price went up!!! Great value for money spent. Will be buying a "Ball" attachment for better adjustability. Got some great steady shots with 48x digital zoom with the Canon S2 I 
Good quality, particularly for the amazing price. Sturdy, well-made, and even the case is nice. Pops open in a second, collapses just as easily. Keep in mind that fully collapsed it's wider than a standard backpack, so if you lash it under a backpack it will be awkward. But the strap on the carrying case makes it easy to loop the monopod and carry it vertically 
The MP100 has served us well since getting it 2 months ago. Like other reviewers, I wasn't expected a whole lot after being disappointed by a $40 monopod made for those well under 6 feet tall. Quite stable, usable as a walking stick, easier to reset height than competition under $50 with twist-lock legs. This monopod definitely exceeded my expectations! Seems to be a niche here for a higher priced version with a pan/tilt head, but I had a 30yr old Leica table top tripod pan/tilt head and the combination works great! On balance, can't be beat even if all you order is the MP100 and pay $6 or so s/h! For use at the beach or where dirt and grit is in the air, you'll want to wipe down the legs before collapsing (cloth used for gun storage work great) or you may have grit in the legs and scratching the MP100 legs in subsequent use. 
This camera is SO user friendly and versatile! With the 8 megapixel resolution, the pics are sharp and clear! Honestly the best camera I've ever had!! A GREAT buy for the cost for all of us non-professional users 
I have to say that is an excellent purchase. I'm a fan of my P880 camera. Wide Angle Len, a feature included, allows to take great panoramic views, with no efforts. The manual optical zoom is great, gives you a control of the picture that i never had with a comercial digital camera. One of my favorites features is the zoom for reviewing the picture, is a 10X zoom and you can check detailed the picture in the LCD screen as in your PC. The 8 Megapixels, allows you to see with great precision minimal details that usually you don't see. Is a great experience, when you take a picture,return home, and the picture is better than your memory. I'm still learning about the other features, but rigth now i think that has a great performance-value relation, and most important, allow my to have photos with a professional touch,. From the South Of the World Carolina 
Great affordable camera, that takes very nice pictures. 
The Kodak P880 is a remarkable bargain that produces astonishing photos. With its 8 megapixels and zoom lens it operates like more expensive SLR's. The quality of the photos, even at the highest zoom, is astounding. For anyone interested in an easy to operate, high quality camera, this is the one 
I bought my camera a few months ago, so I have had a chance to figure out most of its features, not all lol, but I consider that a good thing (extra features means more messing around with it ^-^. Well anyways it is an excellent camera, it does all of the things I want it too, and its half the price of a Rebel. The video it takes is amazing and can record till there is no space on the SD card. For me I have a SanDisk 1g SecureMemory SD Card and I can take about 27 minutes on it which is plenty. And about 38 secounds on the 38mb internal drive. I can take about 329 pictures on the 1g SD and about 10 on the internal. The battery is great on it, I have used it countless hours and havent gotten one bar to go down, so about 2-3 days of use will run it down. So I asume about 8-10 hours. I have never had it die on me, with out me intentually letting it (I guess its better to let the battery run out and then charge it) The focus and zoom feature is fun to play with on the camera and comes in really handy (for the extra zoom there is the zoom button on the top left of the camera, so you really dont need to buy one of those cameras with the 10x) What else? Well the manual features (the biggest reason I got the camera)so play with the ap., iso, and shutter speed they are so fun to mess with, even the hue of the photo which I didnt expect to like, I actually got off really good shots with. The auto features come in handy too, just click and shoot! Macro is a neat feature, get in close its amazing and your shots will be beautiful! Screen is good to, with a crowd around me most can still see the image on the screen (I take video's of my boyfriend and friends sparing)The Mic is on top, it does its job (when its windy you can actually block the wind without even knowing because your hand while on the "on,off-shoot" button covers it (good design)Uploads pic quickly on computer and deleting picutres is extremely quick and easy. The af (auto-focus), focus, and ae are easy to get to for quick fixs other then the focus on the front of the camera. And flash does good. Well I hope my long drawn out review was helpful. I hope you enjoy your camera. I will shortly be purchasing a smaller camera for v-logs possible a canon sd630. But YES DO BUY THE KODAK P880 the mega-pix are simply amazing 
Bought by P880 about a month ago. I am a sem-pro outdoor adventure photographer and I use Nikon 35mm film equipment for the most part. I shoot slide film on my F90s Nikon. I had a 5mp Kodak digital camera but wanted to upgrade to a better digital camera but I could not justify buying a Nikon D50 or D70s as they are only 6mp. And I didn't want to drop 2 grand on a D200. So I looked in the mid-range camera lines. After doing MUCH research, I decided to buy this camera. So far I am happy I did. I have taken it hiking several times, enough that I know its a good camera but of course its a toy compared to pro Nikon film cameras. But I knew that when I bought it. I wanted to have a good camera to take lots of "documentary", "fun" and "travel" shots. For the really powerful stuff I will still shoot slide film. But its too expensive to shoot with extensively! Here's my initial impressions based on the perspective of an outdoor photosgrapher: The Good: 1) Fairly easy to hold as its tall and has an actual grip. 2) Lightweight (but of course at the expense of impact resistance I'm sure...) 3) Great set of manual controls! This is the best part. Autobracket is good as is the interval timer which is great for self-potraits. You can walk far away from the camera and get yourself in the shot (great for solo hikers). 4) Large 2.5" LCD makes it easy to check out your photos 5) Image quality seems pretty good (although not comparable to a high-res. scan of a slide). 6) The manual zoom is great! Much better than power zooms in almost all other cameras. 7) The 24mm focal length is simply amazing! Great for landscapes and outdoor adventure shots. 8) The battery life is great. Shot 250 or so pics on a full charge and that included a lot of playing around with the menus, reviewing photos, etc. I just boughta second Kodak battery on Amazon for $16! 9) Built in flash is pretty powerful and you can add a shoe mount unit as well. 10) 8mp of resolution for the price of a 6mp camera. The not so good: 1) Seems to write to the card pretty slowly. Definately not for action shots! Maybe this would improve if I bought a faster SD card. 2) The "toggle" button on the back for navigating through the menues worries me. Seems like it could break someday. I am gentle with it. Wish they would create a more durable feeling toggle. 3) The LCD viewfinder is hard to see on a bright sunny day. This is where a film camera is WAY better. Optical viewfinders cannot be beat. 4) The in screen manual focus is no good at all. Better just focus with your eyes. 5) Wish they would have made the handgrip a little grippier by adding a rubber stip or the like. Is a little slippery in the hands (always use a neck strap!) In all I highly recommend this camera. If they were to improve upon some of the items for which I have some critisism, I would easily give this camera a perfect review!! Good luck with your purchas 
This was the third 8 meg SD camera I tried - it was the only one that without using a tripod indoors gave me sharp, crisp pictures most of the time. The zoom was smaller that the Fuji or the Panasonic, but the color saturation and sharpness were heads and shoulders above the others. Excellent camera that shoots jpg, tiff and raw 
This is my second "L" lens the other being 70-200L f4 and both are exceptional. If you are looking for professional results you will need good equipment used within it's limits. 
This is my favorite lens. I could not carry the heavier long range teles, and it was a hard decision for me. In the end, I chose this because it was lighter than the zooms. Having previouly used the 75-300 IS zoom, I was leary of getting another 300mm prime, because I may miss the 70-300 range of shooting. But the clarity and colors are so true for this 300 prime, I don't look back. Easy to handle, not so bulky. Fast, impressive photos. Even when I add a 1.4 teleconverter shooting in the 500mm range on my 20D. I use the f4 alot, no problem, great clarity. Awesome lens for the price 
I got this lens for shooting architecture from a distance--an unsual application. I've also found myself using it to shoot kids soccer games. It's super sharp and very fast focusing. I haven't done formal tests at all apertures, but images appear vivid and contrasty at a range of settings. Online reviews rank this lens very highly and my own experience supports those findings. The Image Stabilization seems to work very well, although be sure to turn it off if you're using a tripod--I've found that it can reduce image quality if you forget to turn it off in that application. For shots where you'll be standing around a lot with the lens to your eye, ready for a shot, it gets kind of heavy to carry. If you're shooting sports, you might want to consider a monopod. For other applications, its weight is low enough not to be too big of a problem. It comes with a canvas-like case that includes a loop you can use to attach it to your belt. I've found this works pretty well out in the field, particularly when combined with a photo-vest. The case also can be carried with a neck strap, but this gets in the way of your camera strap and is also thin, so it kind of cuts into your shoulder. As I write this, the Amazon site has a link for 58mm filters for this lens. It takes 77mm filters 
This filter works great. I have used this filter on a Nikon 18-70mm lens and have produced excellent pictures. I have yet to experience any flare with this polarizer. Great polarizer for a great price 
Other than the months of waiting for Nikon to deliver them to Amazon for shipping, the battery itself in a good deal. They work well, charge up easy and hold their charge nicely. Priced well, they cost less than the same type battery than Canon or Sony. I bought them for a D80 and the older En-EL3a would not fit. Of course I had 10 of the older batteries for my D70s and was rather surprised when they didn't fit the D80. Basically the same size and shape, but keyed differently. I was also surprised to find the 3e WOULD fit in the D70s, meaning they are backward compatable. 
This is the real thing. It seems to be impossible to get anywhere and I got it overnight from Amazon. Wow 
This battery is backwards compatible with the D50, D70/70s, and is used in the D80 and D200. So if you have any Nikon DSLR and want a second battery, you want to get this one so that when you upgrade your camera you can use the battery. This battery has built-in circuitry that tells you the actual charge status of the battery, and it is accurate. This is a big deal; *if you are using the D200 or D80* it lets you know when your really do need to switch batteries or charge up. This is the first battery I've seen that is accurate in this regard. Kudos to Nikon. (This feature does not work in the D50/70/70s but the battery otherwise works fine) 
This review is from personal experience. I recently picked up a D200 to replace my D70. This past weekend I took the photos for my sister's wedding. I shot with full functionality using LCD review for every shot and was using the Nikon 18-200 VR lens. Over the course of the wedding and reception I took 295 photos in Fine JPEG mode and reviewed them while shooting. At the end of the afternoon, I still had battery life left and very likely could have taken 100 more photos. Given the features and capability of the D200, I have absolutely no issue with that many photos. I will pick up a second battery for a back up as soon as someone has some in stock. And I could not agree more with the previous reviewer. If you do not have personal experience with this product, there is no need to attempt to review it based on hearsay or something you might have read elsewhere 
I used my new Nikon D200 this past weekend at a Renaissance Faire in high heat, and the EL3e performed like a champ (as did the camera itself). I couldn't believe that I got through three full days of picture-taking (using fill flash after five pm or so) on one battery charge. I finally ran out of juice late on the third day, after approximately 500 exposures. (One caveat: I don't use auto-focus. At all. Ever. So, you know, YMMV. 
I have owned the Canon 10D but could never get used to the "cropped" view from the limited sensor. I barely used that camera over 3 yrs of ownership, preferring to shoot with my film Nikon. With the 5D, the full field of view is back. The "sweep" one feel in framing a picture through this camera is just marvelous. The images (with "L" lenses) are just stupendous. Arguably better than film. This is the first camera less than $6000.00 to be every bit as good as film. I highly recommend it if you are a serious amatuer or professional photographer 
This camera is amazing. I have been a canon user for many years, upgrading as I go. I can not think right now of a camera they could come out with to make me want to upgrade from the 5D. This will certainly be my camera for some time to come 
This is an excellent camera. I upgraded from the EOS 20D which was also a great camera. I upgraded for a couple of reasons. The first was the Full Frame sensor. The EOS 20D has a 1.6X crop factor which effects your lenses overall focal length. On the EOS 5D you get the true focal length of your attached lens. Just like film SLR cameras. Awesome! The one problem I've noticed with the Full Frame sensor on the EOS 5D is it is huge. When you are changing lenses this sensor picks up every little piece of dust, dirt and fibers like a vacuum. I'm constantly cleaning the sensor with a blower. I also had to bring it to a Canon service center. Just to remove some of the dust off the sensor that my blower could not remove. The Canon service center was very far from my home. (Very annoying). I never experienced this problem with the EOS 20D. But, the images you get from the full frame sensor are far superior to the smaller sensor on the EOS 20D. The other reason I upgraded was the larger LCD. The 2.5' LCD screen is a nice plus. The images look bright and sharp. Overall I love this camera. Build, features and image quality are excellent!!!  
After 3 decades as a Nikon 35mm film 'loyalist', a co-worker let me test drive his Canon 5D, Canon EF 16-35mm f2.8L USM and SanDisk Extreme III 2 GB card. Viewing the images on his LCD computer screen helped me decide to sell almost everything Nikon (I kept their SB-800 flash for wireless slave setups) and switch to the established DSLR leader, Canon. Finally, no more heavy and bulky Nikon F5 and having to pay and wait for film processing! No more scanning negatives for hours each night! I've owned the 5D, Canon EF 17-40mm f4L USM, Canon EF 70-200mm f4L USM with tripod collar and Canon Speedlite 580EX for about 3 months and have taken over a thousand RAW and large JPEG images in ISO's ranging from 50 to 3200. (Note: 4 weeks ago, a backup Canon Digital Rebel XT black body was added for the 70-200.) The 5D's image quality stunned every person I have given 4" x 6" and 8.5" x11" colour and monochrome images to. Credit must be given to Canon's Digital Photo Professional (DPP) RAW processing software, Canon's i9900 bubblejet printer, Canon paper and Canon ink. I rarely have to use Adobe Photoshop CS2 anymore because of DPP's quick-to-use tools. The above 5D and any one of the lenses with flash fits nicely into a Tamrac Velocity 7 bag. The larger Velocity 9 bag will fit the entire 2 body with lenses and flash kit. The only negative about the camera is the closed compact flash card gate moves slightly along it's hinge giving the body a less than solid feel. The Digital Rebel XT does not have this issue and therefore feels more solid. A built-in flash would have been nice but not absolutely necessary. Unlike the superb Nikon SB-800, Canon's 580EX is a bit chunky but does it's job wonderfully. The low noise images at ISO's above 800 can easily be removed with DPP or Photoshop. Photoshop goes a step further by removing colour artefacts which lowers the saturation of the image. Meaning saturation would have to be increased after noise removal. Bottom line: If you believe that it costs Canon more to manufacturer a full-frame CMOS image sensor and don't mind spending several months salary on the 5D, go for it! Also, choose your lenses carefully. Canon L lenses go well with the 5D. 
If you've been considering a digital full frame camera (and who hasn't?) this is the one that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Now that Kodak is out of the picture, your choices are the EOS 5D or the 1DS Mark II, which costs more than twice as much. You do have to give up a few things, such as a super-fast frame rate for continuous shooting, but the 5D has the resolution you need for top-quality images, and the ability to get true wide angle perspectives from your EF lenses. I happened to shoot this camera at a concert side-by-side with a vendor "N" camera, both under available light with 85mm f/1.8 lenses at a range of ISOs. I found some shots I liked from the other camera, shot at ISO 400, and comparable shots from the 5D which, to my surprise, turned out to be exposed at ISO 3200. The 5D absolutely lives up to its low noise reputation. But don't take my word for it, try one out for yourself 
THE CON: I've own this now for 6 months, i shoot weddings portraits. I did alot of tests, especially the picture modes. Well don't waste your time with these, their all bad, with the exception of the landscape. You'll just end up using the Standard mode for best all arround shooting. The venetting does accure arround the edges, mostly in low light. Worst of all is the color ballance or White ballance in Auto mode. For what ever reason it has a hard time. My D60 out performs it here big time, not sure why. So you may have to shoot a grey card to get your White ballance more accurate. THE PROS: Quality of the pic is excellent, color saturation is awsome. Blow up of 2'x3' was excellent detail, no noise. I've found the focus of mine to be real good, no problems here. Ease of use after learning curve becomes easy, just read the manuel. CONCLUSION: I would buy again except for that AWB problem. Now i have owned both the D60 and the 10D and neither seemed to have this problem as bad. I use this mode when doing weddings because I'm always on the move and go from one differn't light sorce to another inbetween shots (Tungsten to Daylight). I still think Canon is the best and will alway buy their products 
While the 5D may be less expensive than the so-called professional grade, the camera is more oriented toward the Pro end than the 20D (or 30D) with fewer of dial settings but more capability. Others have covered some other areas, so I'll try to avoid repetition. The full frame makes a great deal of difference to me. I like to print large images and I like to use L or other higher end Canon lenses (with a couple of knockoffs). There's no tradeoff in weight of consequence or compactness. The truth is that I prefer the recent glass that isn't computed for the smaller sensor. I liked the 20D, a lot, and most of my gear carries over to the 5D. I now have three cameras that take the same card and battery. The 5D if anything feels and looks more rugged that the 20D while being very compact. But the pictures? Great. The 20D was and is a first rate camera at 8.2 and its ability to use all Canon lenses, plus the EF-S for the smaller digital image. One person cited slowness over the 20D. I won't disagree with that, but it isn't a big deal to me. I typically use the drive for bracketing on the fly, but almost never for anything just to do a fast sequence, e.g. sports. I've owned motorr drives going back to my days as a pro in the 60s and 70s and they have their uses. Esssential sometimes.But they are like autofocus. On occasion, you need to be manual. Whenever possible, I prefer to single shot or on occasion, a three shot burst. I find there's less chance of missing what I'm shooting. The "Decisive Moment" too often falls between the frames on motor driving. But that's to everyone's taste. I really am impressed with the camera and having tried it, look forward to a trip with it, with the trusty 20D as the second. 
Just got the 5D..traded in my 20D...the 5D is a more solid camera with a full frame sensor...pictures are great and it is easy to use if you are familiar with the Canon system...a little pricey, but worth it!! You'll use it for years 
I switched from the Digital Rebel XT. Since I already had L-glass lenses, I didn't run into problems with the 5D "exposing" cheaper lenses. The 17-40mm really shines on the full sensor! The burst rate is simply astonishing. Missing flash doesn't bother me, heck it's a $3000 camera, I don't expect a built-in flash. I have the Speedlite 580EX, which of course is wonderful in itself. I also have the battery grip which I recommend, as well as the RS-80N3 cable release. Image quality is superb overall - the 5D REALLY shines in high ISO numbers - more so than even the 1D from what I've read. Even at 1600 there's hardly any noise. It allows you to take great, crisp photos in low light where other cameras would require a flash. The camera also is quite light while being very sturdy at the same time. The 3 fps might bother some, but I prefer the incredible burst numbers. 
I will use this lens as a standard on my Rebel XT rather than the the 18-55mm lens that came with the camera. It gives much greater flexibility in outdoor shoots when I'm capturing my grandsons in action on the soccer field. 
For the price, this is an excellent lens. On an APS sized sensor it is equivalent to 480mm at the long end. Some complain about it being a slow lense since the max aperture at full zoom is 5.6 That just means you can't use it in low light and expect great results. If you want a fast lense at that length, however, be prepared to pay a lot of money. With the USM it focuses very fast. Works well for outdoor sports. My rating is based on what you get for the money. Of course it's not as good as L glass but it's way less money 
I bought a Canon EOS 20D digital SLR and the Canon EF 75-300mm zoom lens to take photographs of my children's various sporting events. The magnification factor of this lens is perfect for a variety of sporting events including lacrosse, basketball, swimming and gymnastics. The focusing speed is very good for capturing action shots. I highly recommend this lens as an affordable general purpose zoom lens 
This lens was all I anticipated and more. The auto focus fast and accurate. I gat stunning action shots 
There are no professionals or would-be professional photographers in our house. Instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family. We're not particularly interested in birds, flowers, bugs, race cars, etc. We want to catch our kids doing what they love best; football, basketball, swimming, band, golf... My only advantage is that I am very experienced with Adobe Photoshop, which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots. This year our son is a high-school senior. Instead of buying an expensive portrait package, we voted to spend the money on a Canon Digital Rebel XT kit (with lens). We choose one extra zoom lense (the 75-300mm f4-5.6 III USM Telephoto) for up-close action sports shots. We didn't chose the IS lens because it was out of our price range. We are having great fun with this camera and lens. We have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic' sports setting on the camera (burst mode at full zoom). They are great - crisp and clear. These have been taken in full sun. We realize that we'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations. But I think we can do it. I would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots. They might not be professional quality, but they are just what we wanted 
I have just begun my interest in photography and this was the first zoom lense I have ever bought. The lense provided all that I could ever ask for. I just got back from the zoo with the kids and the photographes are excellent 
Bought this lens a few months back and shot volleyball with it, occasionally used it for football when it got dark. What can I say or add to other reviews?? F/1.8 is great, although the lens is sharper at f/2 or 2.2. I use it near the wide open edge all the time - indoor gyms simply do not have much light. The USM autofocus is great - demoing it in the store, it seemed to nearly anticipate my actions. No rotating front filter, and it doesn't protrude, either. It's got a full time manual focus ring, so I don't have to worry about killing my autofocus motor. In combination with c.Fn 4-1, this is killer. Why the four stars? Chromatic aberration at lower apertures. I do not know where it starts to go away, because I almost never shoot in good light. This was most apparent in a shot of a recent football game. Granted, the team's jerseys were white, and the background was the pitch black of an unlit parking lot, and I had to perform a 100% crop. Nevertheless, an alien-like purple halo surrounded the huddled offensive team. Oh well, you can't have it all! As for volleyball pics, this is the lens. I regularly shoot at f/2.2, ISO 1600, and 1/500, but I might change that soon because that is pushing it. The photos are pretty sharp and the USM definitely helps here. I bought this lens because my 50mm 1.8 just wasn't cutting it - I'd get shots with a tack sharp background and a beautifully bokeh'd subject - just the opposite of what it should be. Using the 85mm removed about 85% of those shots. There are still extreme instances when I swing my camera around and instantly shoot when the USM can't keep up, but there are other instances when I am amazed that it got the shot in focus. From the sidelines, 85mm is too long to get the outside hitter nearest to you, but that's why you move around! Shooting volleyball requires a strategy. The focal length is also good on my 350d for shooting events and staying a bit back from the subject. I'm overall pretty pleased with the lens. I can see what many people call this a "hidden L lens. 
I recently purchased this lens along with the 24-105mm as a part of the fall cash in with cannon rebate program. So, originally, my main reason to get this lens was because it would save me another $50 off of the other lens via doubling the rebates and make it pretty cheap. But now that I have used it for awhile, I am really happy that I got it. The 1.8 maximum aperture does two things really well, lets you take low-light handheld shots and isolates the subject. See my example photos for examples of both of these features. I use this on the Canon Rebel XT and Rebel XTi which have a 1.6X crop factor and make this lens more like a 135mm which is good and bad depending on your usage. This lens produces very sharp results and doesn't weigh much, so it is easy to carry around. If you already have a good range of zoom lenses and are looking for something that will just take really nice, sharp, handheld shots, consider this lens 
All the reviews about this lens are all true. It's a great lens. I love the quality of it. However, if you like to take in door photoes and don't have very big rooms, you might want to consider the 50mm f/1.4. I mostly find my self backed up in a corner trying to take a picture at home 
This lens changed it all for me. I was happy with my Tamrons and Tokinas - I thought. Then I bought this lens. The colors and contrast simply POPPED out from the pics. It is amazing! While there's no red ring around it, it deserves one. The difference in the shots was incredible. It's very well built, focuses (like all Canon USM lenses) fast and quiet and provides the photog with truly beautiful bokeh. For low light, it's awesome. Using an extension tube for macro, it's great. And for portraits, it's nearly unbeatable. So what's the downside? For sure there is one: you'll be sold on Canon lenses. Since this one, I've bought five more, including two "L" series. If that's a downside, so be it! Just buy the lens - you'll love it 
I am really impressed with the results I get from this lens. This is my first USM lens and 85mm is new to me. It serves me really well taking people pictures outside - fantastic background blur and fast enough for low light indoor close ups. Full time manual focus is handy too at times. With my tamron 17-50, this lens is great combo for me 
bought this for my daughters karate tournements and i am very pleased with the quality of pictures i have gotten. this baby never comes off my xt 
I recently bought this lens amid trepidation that the 85mm focal length would overwhelm the x1.6 crop factor of my Digital Rebel XL. My worries were needless: just a step or two back from the subject plus some getting used to the telephoto perspective were enough to turn this lens into the most effective portrait lens that I have. When attached to my EOS Elan 7n film camera, however, the lens really truly comes into its own, as the full frame 35mm SLR delivers the entire focal range of this lens. The focused image is incredibly crisp compared to any other non-L grade lens. And I agree that this lens deserves the red ring of courage around it, like the L lenses have. This glass is absolutely essential in a very short list of affordable lenses, and should give many of the non-affordable ones a run for their money. Solidly built too, with an old-fashioned no-nonsense look to it. I highly recommend it 
Not much to add on top of the other reviews. The only thing you should be aware of is that the depth of field at f/1.8 is paper thin, which is excellent for portraits, but requires perfect focussing. The bokeh (the structure of the background blur) is nothing short of great, easily competing with much more expensive lenses. Yes, it has "L" quality 
The answer is most likely yes; since its price make it the best value for a fast canon prime lens. But before you make the $350 plunge here are few useful things to know about how it can be used. Keep in mind that I use this lens on the Rebel XT (1.6 factor), which means it provides me with an angel of view similar to 135mm on film cameras. SHARPNESS: Yes that's one feature you can count on when buying this lens. This lens produces very sharp pictures. So much so that it will blow away your 18-55 kit lens (if you have one) and all other zoom lenses. Exception to that are the L-series zooms. The sharpness difference will be obvious even in the smallest of prints (4 by 6). If you can't envision such difference then consider this. Sharpness can be viewed as contrast between the edges of different color objects. Hence, the sharper an image the greater the contrast in the edges between such groups of color. This lens captures the contrast in such setting better than most other lenses. SPEED: This lens is blazingly fast. As such you will have the opportunity to shoot at higher shutter speeds wide open (remember the inverse relation between aperture and shutter speed). More importantly you gain the ability to shoot in low light situations (concert for example) and still maintain a decent shutter speed for handholding. Here's the best part, if you're like most new people to photography, you probably plan to take self portraits. This lens will give you that ability, as you will be able to buy few clamp on lights coupled with 100-150W bulbs and start shooting at medium ISO speeds wide open. ANGEL OF VIEW: Assuming you will be using this lens on a 1.6 digital format consider that you will be having a tight crop, more like that of a 135mm lens on a film camera (1.6*85=136). What does that translate to in practical terms? You will have to stand 6-8 feet away from your subject to be able to cover their head and shoulders at landscape orientation. SPECIAL EFFECTS: Here are two special effects you will find useful in this lens depth of field and compression. To some degree or another every lens offers depth of field, which can be summarize as having only the subject of interest in focus and the rest of the picture blurred. This lens is unique in that it creates a very shallow depth of field in which the subject is truly isolated from the whole scene. Set the aperture to 1.8 and focus correctly and you can achieve such results. More importantly the lens quality of such blur (known as bokeh) is outstanding as there are eight diaphragm blades that control the aperture opening vs. 5 or 6 in many other lenses. As for compression, since the camera is a telephoto it will compress everything in its sight closer together to fit in its sight. For example, if you are photographing a person, their face will look wider and their nose will look smaller or flatter. Keep in mind that unlike some of the longer telephoto lenses (300mm for example) the effect with this lens is subtle and pleasant SIZE AND BUILD: Its size and weight are perfect! It balances my XT very nicely. So much so, that I can take pictures at very low shutter speeds with this combination (though I don't find my self doing that that often with this fast lens). All this translates to comfort and confidence when I am shooting with this lens. The build quality is excellent, I find no inherit weakness in the design. If you plan to photograph friends and family then this is the lens. You will take sharp pictures with the right kind of effects for portraits like compression and beautiful bokeh. The lens is fast and designed excellently for maximum control and comfort. You won't miss a shot because of shake with slow shutter speeds and even if you do (that's a big if) you can put its speed to use by dialing a higher aperture. It's only draw back is that it has a pretty tight angel of view on 1.6 factor SLRs. I can't think of any other prime in the non-L canon line up that matches this lens (other than possibly the 50mm 1.4). Truly an incredible value, buy it with confidence! Ps. By no means does this review cover all the merits of this lens. To name a couple, the lens offers precise auto focus and low chromatic aberration. Rather, I covered the features that were most useful for its intended purpose; taking pictures of people. 
I decided to rave about this lens after taking about 80 portraits, or head shots, for a children's theater production. I set the aperture at 1.8 and shot away inside a temple with great indirect soft lighting. And the results were exquisite! The background, located five feet behind the subjects was a subtle blur while the subjects came to life (with single strands of hair resolution). Not bad for my first experience shooting portraits. Now the better part is that I get equal or better results with the thousands of pictures I have taken at high school basketball games. I set my ISO to 400 on my Digital Rebel XT and get shutter speeds of 1/200 to 1/1250. Again, the intended subject jumps out. And there is no red eye (or white eye) from using a flash to light the scene and freeze the action. So after much experimenting, I prefer this to my 70-200 f4/L and my 24-105 f4/L IS lenses as an indoor sports lens. I love all these lenses. This one wins in the area of price and being the fastest lens. This is my lens of choice for a majority of my current shooting situations. 
the monopod functions as i hoped and for the price was an excellent dea 
This monopod does a great job for my camera. You have the quick, easy-off, it attatches to your camera by a screw, and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly. I wanted a nice, inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense. I have a Canon 35mm, and I recently purchased a 75-300 zoom lense for it, and I needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot. If I knew then what I know now, I would buy it again. Nice product 
The Sima monopod is perfect if you're looking for something easy to carry and set up. It exends quickly and has a quick release mount that can stay attached to the camera base. Stability is good, but it does not have a sturdy feel. If you want something with a solid feel, you will have to move up the food chain, but will sacrifice compactness and light weight of this product. 
I bought this monopod after reading reviews here. It's really light-weighted. I used it to take pictures for a dance performace where tripod was not possible. I was able to use slow shutter and got great images. Cons: I saw a pro ( I knew he runs a studio) using a similar monopod which was black. So my only complain is its non-black color. Well I am not a pro anyway. 
It was everything it was reported to be. It works very well. We take it on every trip we take 
Great product for the price. However, Amazon did not specify how much it can handle. My experience is about 5 lb. Tried 8 lb on it, start to feel shaky. Still usable if you handle it carefully, but not solid for 8 lb of load 
This lens bag is a fine product but don't be fooled into adding it as an accessory to Canon's 1.4x or 2x extenders. Both of them come with this exact pouch. Amazon should remove this as a "Suggested Accessory" on the web pages for the two products above 
I am very happy with the item I ordered. Shipment was fast and the price was cheaper than retai 
FAST DELIVERY, GREAT PRICE. I WOULD BUY FROM THEM AGAIN, THANKS = 
This product served its purpose; it is the same cord for hooking up the camera to a PC as the one that came with my camera 
my mom lost her USB cable for her digital camera and Amazon always has everything I need so I order it for her 
this cable was a very essential need for me to upload my photos to the computer. i was very fortunate to find it on amazon.co 
it works just like the one that comes with the camera. Comes in a little plastic bag 
Item was just what I needed to hook my camera to my computer and start downloading photos. Had it unpacked, plugged in and working in less then a minute 
This cable is a four-point USB connector that works with some Kodak digital cameras. Be sure that your camera uses a four point connector before buying this one. Many cameras use a five point connector. These Kodak branded cables are high quality at a fair price 
This is an essential part of the digital picture taking. Can't download the pictures from your Kodak camera onto the computer without it. It should come standard with your camera purchase, but if you misplaced yours, this is the one to get. Arrived promptly as ordered and the value is great 
We received our USB cable promptly. As you know the Kodak USB cables are special in that they do not fit any other regular devices that uses a USB cable. These USB cables are for Kodak's only. The product itself turned out to be everything that it was represented as 
I got this stuff as a gift for a friend of mine. He seems to be happy using it. So I am giving this a 5 star 
The case is made of high quality material and fits my Canon powershot A700 perfectly. I would have given it 5 stars if the case had a seperate compartment for carrying an extra set of batteries. There is just enough room to carry the camera and an extra memory chip. No extra batteries. 
Why use another case when this one is built specifically for this camera? I like it, it's sleek and belt-mountable. Also has enough padding so you can throw it in a backpack, suitcase, etc 
After reviewing my options to purchase for my new Canon A540 we chose this case and I'm glad I did! Nice snug fit for the camera, extra compartments for a memory card batteries, no need for a strap, you are already provided one with the camera. 
IT GIVES THE PROTECCION AND THE HANDLING YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. BUY IT ALONG WITH THE CAMERA NO REGRETS 
Great case. Small, soft, and compact, with extra space for batteries. HOWEVER, the hole for the camera strap is in the center, which means that if your camera strap attaches anywhere OTHER than the middle of the camera, it doesn't line up with this case. Minor detail. For example, the strap of the A530 is near the top of the camera, so the strap goes out the side of the case, unless you pull it sideways to go through the case hole. 
I bought this camera when i was a sophmore in college. And now, 2 years out of college, a handfull of beautiful days, a half-dozen life changing moments, and umpteen vacations later it's still goes with me everywhere and snaps photographs. all the sticker labels on it have since been knocked off but it doesn't matter because i know what they all do. This puppy is built to last. When I eventually pass this one down in the family and buy a new one, I'll be getting another canon for sure. If you're looking for a high-value digital camera that thinks it's a tank, get the Canon s100. 
I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size. It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera. I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched. The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong! The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration). However, I do have a few things to complain about... First off, the battery. This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there. Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short. The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes. This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine. Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function. Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong! Very wrong. The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet. Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up. The flash is very weak. Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room. The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function. The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject. To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem. The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot. These are all the flaws I found in the camera, it's not my first choice in cameras, I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size. If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice. 
I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem. The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software. The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application. But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera 
I want to protect my lens. While not the most expensive, the Canon is adequate for what I nee 
I never take my UV filter off of my lens unless I am going to immediately put on a different filter. There are basically two camps out there, those that feel you should always use a UV filter to protect your lens from dirt and scratches and those that feel it is a waste of time and only degrades your image. Well, I tried going without one for awhile and then dirt started to build up on the front element of my very expense lens. And although you can clean the front element of a lens, I feel much, much safer wiping my comparatively cheap UV filter time and time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage. I think for the nearly unquantifiable loss in image quality you may suffer by having a UV filter on, it is well worth the extra piece of mind it gives me 
I'm sure there are those who'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is "much better" than another, but for my Canon EF-S 10-22mm on a 20D, I figure Canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they're willing to have branded "Canon." It fits fine, doesn't interfere with the lens hood, looks clear, seems to attenuate that nasty ultra-violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all, protects the front element. What more would one want 
This is a good, affordable UV filter for protecting your expensive lenses. I leave it on my lens all the time. This particular filter (L-39 Sharp Cut) is especially good for wide angle lenses ( 24mm focal length), because of its ultrathin profile, which prevents vignetting. I have used regular filters on wide angle lenses, with very bad results. Although this filter is NOT multi-coated, I have not found it to be a big deal in the pictures I've taken. Multi-coated UV filters can cost 2x or 3x the price of this one, which I don't think is worthwhile. All in all, I recommend this filter for Canon or non-Canon lenses 
Works as designed, performs well with intended lens, construction is plastic though 
Pros: - Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element. - Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile 
This is also the correct lens hood for the new EF 70-300mm F4-5.6 IS USM lens. 4 stars because it's $40 for a piece of plastic that should have been included with both of its intended lenses. Shame on your cheap ways, Canon 
I got these gloves to use when taking outdoor photos in the winter. They work very well, the little rubber grips help you better control the camera without having to expose your hands to the elements. They are not really warm enough for really cold weather (below 20), but work well for 20-50 degrees 
What a wonderful lens!! I'm purely a hobby shooter, but I do like to take nice shots. I took this to the zoo the other day and was able to take fantastic closeups of the polar bears, even through glass, and pick out the details on the butterfly wings. The lens is not as heavy as I had feared, and unlike some zooms it does not telescope out under its own weight, so it was comfortable enough to keep carrying all day. I'm using it on a Canon D60 and am nothing but pleased with the performance so far 
I received my 28-200 yesterday from Amazon. Having read the customer reviews, I immediately put my Rebel XT on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my Canon 28-135 IS. Three shots each at f-stops 5.6, 11, and 20, one set indoors at ISO 1600 and the other outdoors at ISO 200. Focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera, highest jpeg setting. After shooting both series, I compared them fresh out of the camera, side by side. Results: the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances. It was visibly sharper at ISO 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20, (the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10), and at 20, it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background. The 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise. Both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in Photoshop. There are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider; different test scenes conceivably produce different results. My conservative conclusion: the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your Canon (unless you are going to drop $2200 on the L Series 28-300 IS and carry it), and the 28-135 IS has no clear sharpness advantage. Between these lenses, its a tradeoff---an extra 65 mm of focal length (105 mm after a 1.6 conversion) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability. Both lenses focus quickly and silently, and both lenses produce usable shots. 
I am a railfan, and having a very large range of zoom is important. Shooting on the fly from a distant bridge shot to a closeup coming around the bend. Focuses quickly too. I have a Canon 10D and I HATE changing lenses because it gets dust inside the camera. This 28-200mm is very practical for my hobby, and gets used on Waterfall and other outdoor scenery too. One note of interest, it is hard to get super-sharp background details with this lens, compared to any of the IS lenses or the L Series lenses, (a buddy and I shot the same closeup shot with an ore dock way in the background and the dock details looked a LOT sharper on his 28-135 IS lens). Same Camera, same settings. Closeup Focused object looked great on both, just when looking at the out-of-focus objects, the IS lenses seemed to do better. This lens is worth the price in my opinion, and superb for amateurs and hobby-photographers like myself. But those looking for a touch more in distant details out of the focused field, the 28-135 IS USM lens by Canon seems to be a little step ahead of this. The L series lenses, of course, are in a league of their own 
I am generally pleased with this lense, and if I could only carry one lense with my digital rebel, this is the one I would take 
We use it with a Canon 300D. It gives good picture quality and are quick to focus. Become a 44-320 on the 300D. A good buy 
From portraits to sporting events, this is wonderful multi-purpose lens. Prior to purchasing the lens, I asked a buddy of mine (photographer for the Philadelphia Flyers, NHL Hockey Team and long time Canon user) if this was a quality lens. He told me to go for it as it is the best buy for the money and that distortion and spherical abberation are extremely minimal with this lens. Truth be told, I've never seen an EF lens I didn't like 
I found this lens resonable as an all around lens, although when it comes to portaits or close-ups I would recomend the Canon 100mm f/2.8 macro. If your looking for a camera to use it on I would highly recomend the Canon 10D WOW 
If you would like a list of sites with reviews email gumby (at) dontquotemeonthat (dot) com Pros: Great sharpness even wide open (wayyyyy better than the F2.8 zooms at F2.8). nice weight and size. shallow DOF in a wide angle lens. Cons: Lateral CA glows purple and green in close and distant bokeh. Watch for high contrast situations. My first copy was DOA. No weather seal. Hood is too tight. Pros: Fantastic! This is one excellent piece of glass. Incredible in low light, with vibrant clarity and color. Well balanced with 20D/Batter pack or a 1D. Cons: None what so ever. if your a newbie here's some info A lens is "fast" when it has a low f-stop... ok so when you have a smaller number the apature is bigger which allows more light through, so this means you can up the shutter speed. and still have enough light reach the sensor. ok so lets say you have an out door shot if you have say an f/4 lens the shutter speed could be 1/250 of a second and you would get a good exposer. Now this lens can only go f/4 but if you in the same outdoor setting, had an f/2.8 lens you could jump to 1/500 of a second and get the same exposer. and freeze the action mmore effectivly, this i believe is why it's a "fast" lens. ok have fun and get it done 
This is a great lens if you need to shoot wide angle in very low light siuations. If you don't need a lens for this exact purpose, you'd be better off spending a few extra dollars on either the 16-35L or 24-70L. These two zoom lenses cover 24mm (and more) at a very reasonable f2.8 with good results. They won't bag a shot in the shadows, but they will handle any decently lit scenario with ease. If you just have to own an f1.4 prime lens, the 35mm f1.4 is a much more universally well-regarded L lens than the 24mm f1.4. The 50mm f1.4 is 1/3 the price of either and just as amazing in my opinion so long as you don't need the wide angle. The only reason I give the 24mm f1.4 a 4 instead of a 5 is the price 
You'll never regret buying the Canon L series. The fit and finish is perfect and image quality is excellent 
This, in my very humble opinion, is the most useful, the sharpest, and just about anything else good you can think of say, best wide angle lense ever produced by anybody, anytime, anywhere. Lightning fast and that's what you want when the light is low. My gal pal Sara and I have often wandered the Caribbean islands in the dawn's early light, as she is into shooting old homes. She particularly likes the gingerbread homes in Marigot, on the French side of St. Martin. I swear she must have them all on her hard drive. It's like an obsession with her and this lens aids her passion, feeds into her manic desire to try and control the light. She just loves it and since I love her, I gotta love it too. Seriously though, I've used the lense quite a bit myself and it's a keeper if ever there was one. You just go wrong with a Canon "L" lense, no siree. Jack Priest, Sailor Home from the Se 
I needed more reach than 400mm gave on my EOS 1D, so I purchased Canon's 500mm f/4L IS three years ago. It's incredibly sharp out to the corners at f/4. With bird and mammal portraits, you see every feather, every hair. The lens is light enough to use on a Wimberley Sidekick. Some claim to be able to handhold it, but I think its eight-plus pound weight is a bit much for that. I carry mine in a long lens case with backpack harness from Kinesis Gear. This lens' image stabilization works very well. I've used it on a tripod with one-second shutter speeds and good telephoto technique, and gotten sharp, publishable images. With an EOS 1D or 1Ds, lens and camera are rain-proof in mild storms. I also got mine through Adorama, and had no problem with delivery or post-sale advertising. If you buy one expensive long lens for wildlife, choose this one. 
I've bought several lenses from Adorama, two of which include a new 300/2.8 IS and the other, this 500/4 IS. All of their deliveries were prompt and well packed. I have zero complaints with them. I dealt the John (Green, I think is his last name) via email. I highly recommend them. As for this lens, it is incredible. Wide open it creates a wickedly sharp subject against a wonderfully soft background (good bokeh). AF is very fast. This lens is extremely good and will still AF when used with the 1.4x converter. (AF works up to f5.6. 
Let's face it. This is a great lens. But, I want to warn you about Adorama. I highly recommend that you choose a better vendor. Adorama is SLOW. They don't respond to emails. They took a week to ship my lens when they said it was in stock. Their customer service is non-existent. Their prices are no better than anyone else. Almost every time I've ordered from them they have contacted me to try and sell me more stuff. (Which further delays shipping) A totally unprofessional organization. I for one will never order from them again. Good luck if you do 
After noting the captions of exceptional photographs that appeared in nature and photography magazines were often shot with this lens, I began to read the reviews. Based on the uniformly excellent reviews, I bought this lens and spent two weeks this January in the Florida Everglades taking pictures of birds. Based upon my experience with the lens, I would rate this as second in sharpness and contrast only to the 300 mm f2.8 Canon L series lens. The lens is handholdable for short periods to shoot birds in flight, but it is best suited for use on a solid tripod with a Wimberley tripod head to allow tracking of birds in flight 
Good advice from the other reviewer about the picture. That having been said I have three of these and really wouldn't want to do without them. These clean my camera's screen and the glass on my lenses without a scratch every time. In my opinion almost a must have in your bag! Good luck 
Amazon states; Product Dimensions: 13.0 x 10.0 x 7.0 inches There was no photo (until I uploaded one) so I thought this was the size stated, but turned out to be one of the little keychain bags with about a 5x5 cloth inside. Works fine, just not what I thought it was, and didn't want someone else to think it was large also. See my photo for actual size next to some keys. Update 4/8/2006 I see they added a photo of what I THOUGHT I was getting when I ordered.. see my uploaded photo in "customer" photos to see what they sent. Not sure WHICH you would get at this point.. Edit 07/29/2006 I see now and then the price I paid jumps from about $5 to $20 for some strange reason.. I have to add that it's a good product @ $5 but not for $20 
This is hands down the sharpest and most used lens that I own. The combination of macro capability, relatively fast 2.8 aperature, and prime sharpness keeps it on my camera more than anything else. I shoot a variety of subjects from macro nature work to indoor sports, and this lens never lets me down. One of the major compliments I have for this lens is its versatility (I disagree with many of the reviews here.) I continually find 100mm to be an ideal focal length with my 1.6 APS-c sensor XT for shooting indoor swimming and diving competitions. This length allows for beautifully tight framing, slightly compressed depth of field, and shallow focus to get amazing portrait shots while eliminating distracting background. The speed of the lens allows me to catch swimmers in the air without using a disturbing flash. This is imperative because flash photography is prohibited at the start of a race. Apart from sports events, the lens allows for very intimate portraits without having to be in the subjects face. This performance along with macro capability truly make this a multi-purpose lens. I usually hand hold for sports photography with good results (the accessory battery grip on my XT is invaluable for this), and usually use a tripod for nature and still-life situations. If I've had one too many cups of coffee I'll use a monopod during sports events. I do wish the lens came with the accessory tripod collar, because it is undeniably a fairly heavy piece of glass, but it is not so important that I have shelled out for one yet. I have no complaints with the AF, and I find that the switch to limit the AF range away from the extreme macro is very helpful. Once you use Canon's USM lenses, you will never buy anything else. The large and easy to use manual focus ring is a luxury. It allows for quick manual override and great control when switching to manual focus. In many situations that I don't want to carry my large bag with me, the 100mm and my 17-40mm L usually cover just about everything I need. (I know that my idea if traveling light is not taking the kitchen sink however.) This is not an L lens for reasons of the lack of some weather resistance and L level coatings, but don't let that dissuade you. It easily outperforms both my L zooms in sharpness and I find it to be comparable in contrast and color. The level of performance and a price that is a fraction of many L lenses makes this an unbeatable value. 
I have been delighted with the quality of pictures I get with this lens. The autofocus is fast and quiet, while the manual focus is very solid and smooth. I'm finally taking pictures worthy of the jewelry my partner creates 
I purchased this lens primarily for use as a macro lens. Since I shoot mostly wildlife (including bugs) I thought the field of view of 160mm (used with my Canon Rebel XT) would be just about ideal. In reality the FL was not enough. I had to approach the bugs much too close and they frequently left the scene quickly. The pictures taken with the lens were extremely sharp and the bocah (out of focus area behind the subject) was very nice. I wound up selling the lens on eBay since it didn't meet my needs 
This is a really handy lens to have in your bag. I added this lens to my collection several months ago, and I haven't regretted it one bit. I took a trip to Montana in August and used this lens to photograph a ton of wildflowers. I was also using a 70-300mm telephoto lens and a 24-70mm wide angle lens heavily, but most of my favorite shots on that trip were taken with this lens. Autofocusing is very quiet since it's USM powered, but it's often tricky to get the right focus if you're doing an extreme closeup. This is a general facet of macro lenses, so you'll probably find yourself using manual focus 90% of the time or more. The manual focus on this lens is quite excellent though, and responds well to fine adjustments. It's also quite easy for me to handhold it, as long as I have a decent amount of light or pop up the flash. With all that being said, this is a nice lens to grab after you have a decent telephoto lens, if you like photographing small things. Otherwise, you might look into getting some other lenses first, i.e. wide angle, fisheye, etc. (unless you already own all of them :-)) 
This is a fantastic piece of glass. Extremely sharp and little artifacts. An awesome lens that I recommend highly. I love going to the local botanical gardens and mounting this baby on my 20D. WELL worth the cost. If you dont have a tripod, buy one 
This lens has extremely fast (and quiet) focus, and is razor sharp. What more could you want, when photographing wildlife up close 
This is a fantastic lens not only for Macro shots but for portraits too. Having the extra distance allows for far more flexibility when out and about. Having tried both the 50, 60 and 100mm - I'm glad I went with the 100mm 
I use it for my s70.. It works over 10meters (thats right!) and from the back too, so I am very happy with it.. I bought it today so maybe it is improved now.. 
Great for using with a tripod, now you can be in the pictures too 
May I introduce you to one of the least know and yet most superb lenses Canon makes. You probably even stumbled on to this page by accident, looking for another Canon lens, looking at various macros, or even just intrigued by this higher-priced lens you've probably never even considered. Let me just say this about this lens: Ultra sharp. Ultra colorful. Ultra contrast. Ultra solid. Like everybody else, I initially bought this lens for its macro. The 60mm and 100mm options were a lot cheaper, but my collection is entirely L-class and I'd learned to trust putting gobs of money into the lenses with the red ring. So I put my money where my L-faith is and went with this lens. Needless to say, my faith was rewarded again. Yeah, sure it's got the 1.0x macro capability, and this is important. But what I wasn't expecting was the image quality. It is unbelievably good. Now I'm not somebody who's taking his first trip into L land and comparing this lens to the $300 run-of-the-mill glass. I've used six L-class lenses significantly and I'm comparing this lens' image quality to THOSE. You will find yourself using this lens as much as its 180mm focal length and f/3.5 aperture dictates. The lens is versatile both as a super-fine telephoto and as a 1.0x macro. The macro capability is the main feature. 1.0x macro literally means that a 35mm wide object will completely fill a 35mm frame. Basically, it's a small microscope. If you dare to dial in the aperture to the wide-open f/3.5, the DOF is approximately that of the thickness of two sheets of writing paper at 1.0x. Needless to say, you'll need a tripod, preferably with macro rails that slide forwards and rearwards for ultimate control. (For those of you new to macro, focusing the lens changes the magnification factor. So as one focuses the object, the object's size in the viewfinder changes. This is why I mention the macro rails, they allow you to achieve focus and physically move the lens/camera in and out to reachieve the desired composition.) As a telephoto, due to this lens' superb image quality, it actually produces images of a much greater quality than the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS. (I know firsthand, as I own it too) The difference is in the 70-200mm's versatility. If the light drops too low, the f/2.8 and the IS bests the f/3.5 quite rapidly. If the distance of subjects change quickly or you are unable to move your feet to frame images, the 180mm will be too constricting and the zoom will win. But under conditions where the 180mm f/3.5 can perform unhindered (such as at an airshow or out flower hunting), it will consistantly produce brighter, more saturated, and sharper images than the 70-200mm F/2.8 IS. There is a complaint that circulates about the slow speed at which this lens autofocuses, expecially annoying when trying to be used as a telephoto. This is actually incorrect. The lens' autofocus drive does infact move very quickly, but it must traverse all the way from infinity to about 4" in front of the lens to find the subject. This is where the wait time comes into effect. Here's the solution: utilizing the AF limiter switch allows you to limit the AF search to only between infinity and about 5' in front of the lens. Consequently, this range is about 10% of the focus range (the other 90% is in between that 5' and the 4"). I no longer experience AF "hunting" problems when trying to use the 180mm as a telephoto. Some other info about this lens: The front objective element is actually concave. I think this is the only L lens Canon makes with a concave front element. It's probablyexpensive to replace if an accident should occur, so utilize a UV filter (72mm filter size). I recommend only the B+W or Hoya Multi-coated brands. (Yes they're pricey, but worth it) The hood for this lens is actually a little too small in my opnion. If shooting a backlit object, I sometimes get the heavy orange glow in the viewfinder soI am forced to use my hand as a "hood extender" and block the sunlight. For its size, this lens is relatively lightweight. It is much lighter than the 70-200mm F/2.8L IS and easily handholdable for extended periods of time. This lens is compatible with Canon's extenders. I have personally used it with the 1.4x extender. The results are excellent. While CA and sharpness degrade noticeably on the 70-200mm, this lens shows barely a difference in image quality, except for the change in designation to a 252mm F/5, of course. And add to the fact that the macro capability is now gone from 1.0x to 1.4x, a big bonus. So for whom does this lens apply? -Those who neither have a macro or a telephoto prime who desire a single piece that can handle both aspects with excellent results. -Those who plan on performing professional product photography. -Those that are looking into serious nature photography (packing this lens with a wide-angle is pretty much all you'll need on a day hike). What this lens does not do well: -Low-light photography. -Event photography. -Landscapes. Alternatives: -60mm/100mm: lesser image quality, less telephoto compression in macro images, no real double-duty as a telephoto, but a whole lot cheaper and wider aperture. -MP-E 65mm: much greater magnification (5.0x), lower image quality, no telephoto capability, odd design means studio use almost exclusivel 
When this lens is used with a 1.6X camera body such as the XT, 20D, or 30D it ends up giving you an amazing 288mm Macro or you can go one step further with the 1.4x or 2X TC's and make it a 403/576mm super power. Of course whenever doing this you must either use a tripod or flash except in blazing light. It is a little slow to focus compared to many of the other lenses canon offers, but since you will most likely be using manual focus a lot of the time anyway, this is not a huge drawback. It also gets heavy to carry after a few hours and you will have people ask you questions about both your and their cameras. On a good note parents are pretty good about keeping small children out of your way when you have this lens mounted. The narrower background as compared to the 60mm or 100mm macro lenses makes cluttered areas easier to deal with. The extra working distance is also a plus when working with wary insects etc. It is best to use a shutter release and mirror lockup for shutter speeds longer than 1/30 if you want sharp pictures. The 60mm Macro wins in convenience, but for absolute clarity and improved working distance the 180 comes out on top 
I spend most of my time as a photographer taking macro photographs of flowers and other small things in nature. I chose this lens over Canon's 50mm macro and 100mm macro for two reasons: (1) it is constructed with higher quality UD glass, so it has great color and contrast, and it's incredibly sharp at all f/stops, and (2) at 180mm, it allows you to stay farther away from your subjects and still focus to 1:1. This makes it easier take photographs without disturbing your subjects and it allows you to have a smaller, more blurry area in the background so that the background doesn't compete with the subject for attention. The lens also comes with a tripod color, which allows you conveniently change from vertical to horizontal, and it adds stability with your lens better balanced on your tripod. The lens has an ultrasonic motor, so it's fast and quiet when focusing, though I highly recommend setting the focus limiter 1.5m-infinity when not shooting macro photography. It will speed up the time it takes for the lens to focus. The only drawback I can find with the lens is that it is constructed with only an 8 blade aperture diaphram. Theoretically, with a higher number of blades, it would allow more natural blurs, but I can say I've never noticed a problem in my photographs 
I have seen glowing reports on this lens in several magazines, most notably in Shutterbug. It is truly a splendid performer and one well worth paying for if a photographer needs the extra working distance afforded by a macro lens in the 180mm to 200mm range. Its performance is certainly as good, if not better, than Nikon's venerable 200mm f4 Micro Nikkor, which was one of the first - if not the first - telephoto macro lenses in this focal length. This Canon lens excels not only in macro photography but also in nature photography, getting close-up images of animals in the wild without working too close to disturb them. If I owned Canon equipment, then this lens would be an essential part of my kit 
I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05). Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect. There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly 
I almost didn't buy this camera simply because of the plastic body (I'm used to a Praktica MTL3 film camera, which is built like a tank). However, I'm glad I overlooked that because the camera is top-notch in terms of robust features and the quality it provides. Startup time is very quick and making adjustments to shutter speed and aperture is intuitive. If you get the bundle with the kit lens, I highly recommend complimenting it with the very affordable Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens, especially if you are a big fan of DOF and do a lot of available-light / low-light photography. 
I am new to SLRs and I cant belive how good this camera is. This camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces. I always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent, but looking back, they look terrible compared to this. 
I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camera, its beyond description... 
This Camera is excellent one!! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category, I'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles.. Highly recommended 
I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin. I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working. The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory. The photos, however, are wonderful. Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable. (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos. 
It is extremely easy to use. Hard to figure out the menu, but once that is done there is no problem. Takes beautiful pictures. Great for action shots as well. Seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in 
When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery. They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes. Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice. So I said no. So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots. Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase. Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button. So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine. as for the quality of photos.....i love them 
I had 2 Rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses. While I had owned other digitals I keep going back to my old Rebel, until now. We got the back up battery pack. My husband and I love it 
I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this camera. If you have teens in the house watchout!, they'll definitely want this camera. It is easy to use and well worth the money. When my camera arrived, I was amazed at how small and compact it was. I let my son check it out first and within no time we were both using it. I really love the movie feature. You can record anywhere and everywhere and the sound is excellent. My last camera only recorded, but didn't have any sound. It was nothing compared to this Sony. The 8.1 mega pixels makes the pictures come out great. My sons and I love it. They record all the time and take numerous pictures. I also like that it has internal memory, so if you don't have a memory stick yet, you can still take pictures. The 2.5 inch screen is perfect. It makes it so easy to get a good shot all the time. I have had no problems with this purchase at all. The only thing I would recommend to Sony is to make something that would protect the 2.5 inch screen from getting scratches, just like they do with the optical lens. It is always closed and covered when its not in use. But besides that small detail there, the Sony is a GREAT investment. I will definitely buy Sony again, especially when I decide to update or if I'm looking for a gift to give. 
Best camera I have ever owned. Easy to use even with all the features. Don't be afraid to buy this one 
The DSCW100 8.1 was a great shirt pocket point and shoot with easy menu directions to the added features built in 
I bought this camera several weeks ago and have test-driven it in the forest preserves of Chicago and in Upper Michigan. It does a terrific job. I am an artist who studied film in school and yet never used a digital camera. I wanted something that was kind of between a point and shoot and an SLR. I wanted some manual functions to fool around with, and yet I also wanted the easy shot for family photos and such. I didn't want to start my digital experience on an expensive SLR, so this proved to be a great buy for me. It's very small and compact and yet very powerful. 
If you are looking for a digital camera with many high level functions and features, the Sony Cybershot 8.1 mp is a great buy. It is highly affordable and takes photos with excellent precision, day or night. The camera is very user friendly and the ease of use is a plus. The memory stick is sold separately and is a must purchase accessory if you plan to take many photos. I am happy with the clarity of the photos and the video functionality that you may want to have handy. The camera is an excellent buy!!! 
I bought this little camera recently from Amazon. Thanks for tremendous service and speedy delivery, Amazon. The Sony DSC-W100 is terrific. It is very simple to operate. The menu system is well-organized and easy to understand. Inserting the battery and memory card is a snap. The Zeiss lens system yields incredibly sharp photos even at the automatic setting. The flash is pretty powerful,too! I took some shots in a rather dark restaurant, and the pictures came out really nice and clear. The macro function is superb with crisp, well-defined details at very close range. The powerup time on this camera is fast as well as time between shots. There is very little shutter lag, and you usually get the picture you intended to get. Autofocus can be a little slower until it "finds" the target perfectly in certain situations. But this is no big deal compared to older digicams. I like being able to switch quickly from viewing the pictures in replay mode back to camera mode by simply tapping the shutter release button lightly. You are quickly ready for another picture. The camera is not miniature and weighs nearly six ounces, which is not extremely light--but is comfortable to carry or place in purse or pocket. I also have a Canon Digital Rebel XT, and this little camera does take sharper pictures. Of course, you do not have the versatility of the SLR, but it is a great everyday camera to take along with you for all the shots you would otherwise miss. I highly recommend this camera and recommend purchase from Amazon. Update: I have now used this camera in the video mode. WOW. It produces incredibly sharp videos with a fast frame rate that looks terrific on our television. A multi-purpose cable is supplied with the camera that allows USB 2.0 and audio/video hookup. You must decide what zoom level before you start shooting your video because once you start, you cannot zoom in and out. If you have a 1 Gb memory stick Pro Duo you can take about 12 minutes of video. I want to get the 2 Gb Pro Duo stick which allows almost 25 minutes of video. This would be ideal to take along when you want to switch between still and video shots and keep your video shots consistent and consecutive in order. You must use the PRO Duo stick for the high quality (fine) video mode 
My Sony DSCW100 camera is small but very functional and user friendly, it makes photography an easy and interesting hobby. 
Photography afficionados have long had two choices when it comes to buying a digital camera: a tiny everything-automatic portable camera that takes decent pictures or a brick-sized everything-manual professional camera that takes fantastic pictures. Almost a decade after the introduction of the consumer digital camera, Sony has finally taken a swing at combining the best qualities of both worlds into one package, and the DSC-W100 is a solid first effort. Sony has had the tiny part down for some time - dimensionally, the W100 is on par with other recent Cybershot models and competitor brands' offerings, and features the now-common 2.5" bright LCD display with a minimum of buttons on the back. Aside from the attractive mini-diamondplate face and chrome trim, visually there's little to set this camera apart among the others at your local electronics counter. Initial toying with the camera doesn't dispel any first impressions. All the prerequisite automatic features are there, the buttons are smartly arranged so all the most common functions are right at hand, it's obviously a point-and-shoot camera. But it's when you begin to delve into the features that you realize that the W100 is something entirely different. The usual mode knob is there on the back with the Auto mode and Scenes modes, but now there's Program and Manual modes - something standard issue on professional cameras but radically new for a point-and-shoot. This means you can use any combination of auto or manual settings on all functions to get a shot. For example, shooting in a dimly lit room, you can use a slow shutter flash to even out lightning, or turn off the flash with a slower shutter for richer colors, or raise the ISO so you can get a steady shot with a higher shutter speed, or just put it in auto and shoot, etc. All the different possibilities previously reserved just for professional cameras are now at your disposal. The camera is as simple or as involved as you want, and it still fits in your pocket. I've owned several other digital cameras, both portable and pro, and they've all had somewhat manual features, but the W100 takes it to a new level. Mounting the W100 on a tripod, I attempted to get a long exposure shot of the night sky, something all the other digital cameras have done adequately. Manually setting the shutter speed, the camera displayed the overall exposure value as I adjusted - the camera was telling me before even touching the shutter button if the resulting picture would be dark, bright, or even. I set the shutter as slow as it could go and using the two-second timer, fired away. The picture was amazing; though only a few stars were visible to the eye, the W100 caught the light of well over a hundred. I noticed a bit of radial blur on the stars around the border of the image, only to realize later that the camera was pointed North - the shutter speed was so slow that I was actually *capturing the rotation of the Earth*. Now THAT'S manual. Also of special note is the W100's digital "Smart Zoom". As a general rule with digital cameras, you should disable the digital zoom feature, as zooming in beyond the optical range produces a cropped and therefore lower-quality image. But here again Sony has a trick up it's sleeve, by cropping from an 8.1 megapixel capture regardless of where you have the image size set. If you shoot a 5 megapixel-size picture that utilizes the digital zoom, the image is actually captured at a full 8.1 Mps and then your 5Mp picture is cropped from that. The result is an optically-zoomed clear picture. This also means that at the lowest image size, you can get a full 15x zoom (the equivalent of a 500+ mm telephoto - in a pocket camera!). It's an absolutely brilliant technique that you'll probably see on all future digital cameras. Sony still has a bit more work to do on the pocket SLR idea. Included with your purchase is an accessories catalog featuring an array of lenses and filters, none of which are compatible with the W100. It's typical of Sony to have a bizarre distribution of features in any given product lineup, but it would seem obvious that the most SLR-like camera should have SLR-like accessories. And W100 owners should disable the Auto Focus Illumination light when shooting people; the blazing red light is great for focusing on inanimate subjects, but could probably be used as a tactical light to blind assailants in a pinch. Overall, the W100 is a remarkable newcomer that truly raises the bar for what you can expect from a point and shoot pocket camera. Novices are accommodated with full automation, and can learn gradually by trying out individual manual functions while other settings remain automatic. And experienced photogs will be right at home with the Manual mode and wide range of settings. Five stars for what is hopefully Sony's work in progress 
Unlike some of the other reviewers, I've had no problems with this battery...and I've had it over a year. I'm a pro photographer, so it has been recharged over and over and over and still holds a charge. Maybe it is better because I tend to totally drain my batteries before recharging? I also use this battery in the Dual Battery Grip alongside the Canon and other off brand batteries 
Ive had it for a couple months now. I notice no difference between it and my canon bp511. My only gripe with it is its cheazy silver plastic color, but hey, who looks at your batteries 
Bought one of these a year ago. Works about the same as the Canon battery I got with the camera. I alternate between the Canon and the Lenmar batteries and haven't noticed any difference 
I didn't think it would be, but this lens winds up on my Rebel XT most of the time. The lens is compact and performs well indoors in low light - best to use autofocus set to center point only. 35mm focal length is a nice general purpose focal length on a 1.6 crop DSLR. This lens is sharp at f2.0 and really sharp by f2.5-f2.8. I have a lot of experience and test my lenses with tripod/mirror lockup, I'm not just saying sharp at f2.0 - it IS sharp. I considered the 24mm f2.8, but f2.8 is a pretty slow prime at wider focal lengths - loses a lot of the low light advantage. I am impressed with the colors I have been getting from this lens, wasn't really expecting the colors to be so good at such a low price point - doesn't have the L lens coatings, but Canon did the colors right. The autofocus speed is pretty good - not as fast as ring USM lenses - and it is a little noisy/buzzy. I currently own 7 Canon lenses (2 Ls) including 4 primes - this 35mm is definitely a top bang-for-the-buck lens. (another is the 28-105 f3.5-4.5 USM zoom - and I don't even like zooms) Looking for a low-light prime? For 240 bucks at Amazon - just do it 
Super lightweight, sharp wide open, short minimum focus distance, fast AF. Decent bokeh. Ability to take pictures in very low light , Super cheap when compared to it's 35mm f1.4 L $1000+ brother and at 1.6 on digital its a normal lens see some shots: http://www.pbase.com/2bruce/gillin 
Bought this lens as a 'standard' prime lens for my Digital Rebel XT. What I found was that it was a fast, sharp, and lightweight lens that made the camera great for long walks. This would be the perfect lens to take to an amusement park, hiking, or biking where size and weight are a concern. I've also used this lens for macro photography and portraits where it shines. The F2 Bokeh is wonderful and center sharpness is superb even at F2, much better at F4 which is what I use most of the time. On the negative side, autofocus is noisy. To compare, it's like a drug-crazed wasp trapped in a matchbox. Maybe a mosquito buzzing close to your ear. It's not louder than the shutter, though. If this were a film camera and I was trying to take candid shots, I'd complain more, but it's a 56mm equivelant lens. Another negative is build quality. They really should make the body of this lens out of thicker plastic. No reason to skimp there as the 'feel' of the lens certainly gives you much more confidence for very little weight penalty. Make it feel solid. I've got a 52-55mm step-up ring on it as I've got a slew of 55mm filters. This also helps in that the lens cap is further from the body of the lens and easier to remove and replace. If Canon had made a faster lens in 28mm at the same price point, I would have gone that way. For my tastes, it would have been preferable to have that extra field of view assuming the quality was as good 
The product is a top quality product. The filters work excellent with my Canon Powershot S2. Without a doubt, worth every penny, especially considering the price I paid for it, which was at least half of where I saw it listed at other places. Very happy with the purchase 
I am very happy with this set of filters. The price was right and they come with a carry case so you dont have to worry how you are going to carry them if you go lite, camera and filters 
I am starting my career as a professional photographer, and I haven't had any problems with these filters. They come in a nice case, and are easy to attach to my lenses. 
This set of basic filters is a must have for every camera bag...even new SLR users will find them easy to use and they will enhance your pictures - without a doubt 
The backpack holds all my stuff with extra room. The only thing was that I thought I was ordering a bag not a backpack based on the picture shown. The backpack is a little on the heavy side for me but I do like it 
This bag easily accomodates my new Canon S3 IS, along with the lens adapter and hood, with room to spare. Recently, during a trip to Europe, I was also able to fit several other items into the bag: the rechargeable battery charger, AC adapter, and outlet adapter, along with two sets of rechargeable batteries, as well as a UV filter, and I still had room for more. I've no doubt the wide- and tele-converters for this camera would also have fit, with room to spare 
If you are at the intermediate level with photography and need a camera bag that is strong and comfortable this bag may be for you. I can fit my canon s2is, adapter, two filters or a lens in this bag. This is all I expected from what I read about this product. If you have a SLR with multiple lenses,,, sorry,,, you will have to spend more bucks for a bigger bag. 
Absolutely love this camera bag! I hate dealing with a purse and camera bag while traveling, so I just carry this bag. Everything I need (wallet, cell phone, car keys chap stick) plus all the camera equipment fit just fine in this bag. You can't go wrong with this. My husband will even hold it for me since it's not a purse! 
I've had many camera bags over the years, and this one seems to fit the bill the best. It is roomy - carries camera body and one lens, plus charger, extra batteries, manual, memory card, and has room for another lens or two. I wouldn't say it would be able to hold more than three lenses. We recently took this on a trip to St. Lucia and it held up well, even repelling some unexpected rain. We were very pleased. The size is perfect - roomy but not overly bulky. I'd highly recommend this bag! 
I would have rated this bag with ***** if it would have been a little bit larger. It will fit only a SLR camera with its lens on. No aditional space. Actually, there are some good spots to keep your extra flash cards, you extra battery and charger. So, if you want to move around with your SLR with at least two lenses, get a bigger one 
This bag is small, but it fits my Canon Rebel XT with the kit lens and battery grip. I also carry the 50mm/1.7 lens in there and still have room for the manual, battery charger and other small components. I will be getting a bigger bag when I start acquiring more lenses, but it is great for now and for summer travel. It also looks nice and is very sturdy 
The bag is suppose to hold two cameras,I have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries. I recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here. might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not SL 
silver,light,sturdy..carries camera securely from the neck or on a belt 
I was able to scout out the different case options for my Sony DSC-N1. After much review, I asked my wife for her opinion and she picked the LCS-NB. It holds the camera nice and snug but you could work in a memory stick or battery. So far, so good 
Was extremely pleased with the prompt service as well as the pric 
The battery pack arrived quite quickly, and we were delighted to be paying far less for it than the manufacturer was charging for a product that works just fine 
nothing wrong with this battery. personally i would prefer my camera to use AA but battery life for lithium ion batteries is pretty good. no complaints here except for the price. but necessity made me purchase a second one, not because my other one died, just cuz sometimes i need a spare 
Exceptional perfomance and long life makes this battery a great deal. Always good to have a back -up and this battery comes in handy 
I received in a short amount of time and was just what I needed. This way I am able to have my camera turned on for almost a full day using this as a backup Nothing is worse than needing that little more time to be able to get the enire family reunion and unable to add the last family into the scrapbook but this cured it all 
Battery works great, shipping from amazon took too long. I purchased other items the same day from other retailers and they were delivered 5 days sooner than the amazon item 
We bought this as a second battery for the Sony W50 digital camera. These batteries, in this camera, last a LONG time. Having a spare allows us to keep one in the external charger and swap quickly when needed. It is an original Sony product so fits and works perfectly 
Sony has done it again! Fast charging and LONG lasting, this battery is perfect for my Sony Cyber-Shot Camera! 
I bought this for my Nikon D70 Digital SLR with 18-70mm Nikkor lens. It works great except that the lens cap does not work with the polarizer filter on. It works with the other three filters: ND4, ND8, and UV. The price still beats buying four filters individually. I like the case also 
Sure beats the price of buying a Polarizer, UV and 2 ND filters individually 
It's a pretty convinient bag.I put a Canon rebel XT with a Tamron 28-75 lens,a Canon 70-300 lens and a external flash inside and I still have the small pocket for wallet,keys etc. The only drawback of this bag is,you can not put in big lenses.The Canon 70-300 is the limit.But if you only have a limited gear collection,you need to give it a try 
Have had this bag for a year now love it. This is what I carry in the main compartment: Nikon D50 with 18-200mm lens attached. Wide angle 10-20mm lens Depending on where I'm going - either the D50 charger, the speedlight and other little accessories OR my Canon SD550 elph with its charger. The top compartment holds extra batteries, cleaning supplies filters. The small zipper compartment on the flap is a little bit tight for anything other than a cleaning cloth, extra memory, ID's/Credit Cards. CONS: Being a woman... the strap isnt all that flattering going diagonally across the front, but I usually carry it in a sort of "1/2 slung" position or fully around in front anyway (unless I'm hiking). It could be a little snug inside if you are trying to carry alot of accessory items. Would have liked to see the padded portion of the main strap a little longer so padding is still on shoulder when bag is in the front slung position (since I carry it that way alot). PROS: Compact yet perfect fit for my camera body, 2 lens, accessories. Very snug secure on the back - easily hike, ride a bike or even a horse without fear. Had no trouble getting used to "slinging" it around front. Actually can use bag as a kind of shelf for stabilizing elbows while composing shot. Superior Lowepro design - great quality, sturdy zippers, love the rain cover. Note: I did try the slingshot 200 version 1st and found that it was just too big for my needs so exchanged it for this smaller version - no regrets, cant imagine I'll ever need another bag. 
I have had this bag for a year and recommend it. I use it all the time. It's a great walkaround bag. The first time you're in a place where you want to get to your camera quickly or don't want to put your bag down you'll appreciate the sling design. Just be aware for a long mountain hike you may feel the weight on your shoulder after some time. My only error was getting the 100 - I should have gone with the 200, and plan to do so. I like to keep my lens hood in place which requires a little more room. I'd also found that I need a little more room for non-camera things. A word on the all-weather cover - a great feature. A few weeks ago I was in Bermuda and walked to a beach about 25 minutes away. Just as I arrived a soaking rain began that didn't let up for the entire walk back. If I hadn't been able to pull on the cover my equipment would have been soaked. Now I wouldn't buy a bag without one 
I compared a lot of bags for use with my new Nikon D50. I wanted a bag that was versatile and could be carried on hikes. The Lowepro Slingshot is definitely the bag for my camera! Plenty of room for a couple of lens, the battery charger, and other small items. 
I just got back from vacation. I have a bad back, and it was sore. I was very happy to discover that the way this bag hangs, I could carry my Nikon D-70 and one or two extra lens very comfortably. Gear is super easy to access and the bag provides a nice platform for changing lenses. I have other bags which heft lots of gear, and they're great for travel days and the occasional big shoot, but if you're looking to hike (and have a separate way to carry a tripod), then this is a wonderful bag 
Just got the Slingshot 100 for my Nikon D50 with kit lens. Previously, I bought a Nikon bag but as this was just a bag to fit the camera and nothing else, I found this unpractical. The D50 fits perfectly in the slingshot 100, though I had to readjust the velcro camera compartment dividers first. This was quite disappointing as I have almost no free space in my camera compartment anymore! I guess the Canon 350D, which has a smaller body, will fit in this bag better. Anyway I have no other lenses yet (the 18-200 still on order) so that all my gear (battery, memory cards etc.) finds a place in this bag. The bag fits very well, is comfortable and is well-made. Before buying though, do check if your camera and lens will fit 
This is my first review on Amazon because I've bought products and never really felt like they deserved a review. I would say I did a thorough search for a bag that would fit me. I have a Nikon D50 with the 18-55mm lens and a 70-300mm zoom lens. I originally had a large Nikon bag that was a pain to carry around. It was inconvenient to carry and to access my camera. So when searching for a bag I wanted something that was compact, easy to carry, could hold my gear neatly and securely, and have my camera easily accessible for those moments when you want to take a quick shot and put it right back. I went to camera stores and tried on bags, looked all over the internet for reviews and finally came across the Lowepro Slingshot 100AW. It had everything that I was looking for plus more. Besides being able to hold my camera gear, it was able to hold my battery charger, cleaning supplies, extra batteries, filters, and has a built in all weather cover. Even with all of that packed I still have space for my wallet, cellphone and keys, thus freeing up my pants pockets. The great thing about the bag is that it is able to give me that extra stability when taking photos when bag is slung around to the front of me. The bag is so well designed that there's no worry about having the bag opening up and having all your expense gear fall out. The opening where you remove the camera has straps that prevent it from opening all the way by accident. All in all I am very satisfied with the bag. I would recommend it to anyone but if you have more than a couple of lenses to your photography arsenal I would upgrade to the Slingshot 200AW. 
This fit my Olympus E500 great. I recently took an overseas trip and this bag was great for traveling and on the go trips. And the weatherproof cover really came in handy a few time when it started to rain unexpectly. The only thing that was a bit odd is the strap that you can wear around your body. It comes up the chest at an odd angle, my husband didn't have a problem with it but I did. So maybe thats just a girl thing.... :) Most times I didn't use the extra strap, just threw it over one shoulder and went. The bag held 2 lenses, extra battery, charger, and I had room for keys, wallet and a few little personal odds and ends. My friend was so impressed with it, he is buying one today. Some one asked if they can attach a tripod to the bag. There aren't really any extra loops on the outside of bag. A stadard tripod won't fit insidde. You would have to rig something up on the outside yourself. IMO I don't that that it would work very well but you can try. 
This bag is very sturdy and padded. The description is pretty scanty, but I took a chance and bought it. Glad I did. The bag holds my JVC GR-DVL805U mini DV camcorder, the strap, battery, AC adaptor cord, 4 tapes, the remote, and all connector cables. It's kind of a tight squeeze with all those accesories, but the bag is compact, comfortable, and easy to carry, with the camcorder still being protected. The bag also comes with a lifetime guarantee against defect. The only thing that could be improved is that it's awkward to get the camcorder in or out of the bag while carrying it with the strap over the shoulder; the zipper is hard to reach and goes all the way around the top. That's the only thing that could be improved, and could be considered a safety feature, because the camcorder certainly won't come out unexpectedly. The bag is also very durable and nice looking. I recommend it 
Ordered October 9th.... Not delivered as of November 22nd. Now due to arrive mid December. Yuck 
No need to run and guess whether the self-timer has already fired when I want to have a picture together with my girlfriend. Extremely useful when taking shots in low light conditions with long exposure, too. Works perfectly with my D50 
I love this remote. I find it very convenient to take self portraits and night time long exposure shots. Unfortunately I lost the remote during my trip to smokies and still have no clue how and where - might have slipped from my pocket in a hurry. I have ordered a second one now. It is so tiny that you do not feel the weight or volume in your pocket or camera bag. I wish it had a strap/thread or hole so that it can be attached to key chain or camera or etc. 
I love using it, long exposure, great for bulb. Cheap and cool. 
Works as advertised. I use it extensively for environmental work where I want to remain a short distance from my camera. It's great for portraits where I am near and concentrating on my subject and can shoot remotely without losing contact with model. The remote also came in handy for several self-promotions where I seated seating myself in an office atmosphere. 
I use it with my Nikon D70, and am very satisfied with it. I most often use it for long exposures, for taking picture that include myself, and for taking pictures of my 6-month old daughter, who stops acting naturally when she notices I hold the camera, so I place it on the tripod, and take pictures of her. 
I use it with my Nikon d50 and it works as promised. I took some long exposure shots with it last night and they came out crisp. I am also a parent and I find that using a remote is much easier than setting the timer and rangling a toddler in place within the limited window of time. I recommend this device to anyone and I find it quite affordable. Like most reviewers, I think it would have been great if it was an included accessory 
This great lens is a joy to use.... Keep in mind the min on 1:6 sensors will be about 160mm so you are limited in that respect. Would be nice if you could see lens IS settings like focus range preset in view finder. Don't like the fact that the lens hood does not have a mark to show where it can be installed quickly.. not bad using the logo as indicator for normal use, but always have problems putting it back on reversed to put away. Other hoods have a small dot etc to help line it up. This lens with grip double batteries will get your attention after a days shooting with it. The GOOD news... when you take it off you feel you have a pocket camera weight. I posted some action/panning shots for this lens as there didn't seem to be any others. A couple of aircraft and a couple of auto racin 
I was using my new Canon lens during the 4th of july Rodeo in Redlodge Montana. Although I was pretty far from of the bull and horse riders gate, all my photos were sharp and no blur at al 
If you use this lens on a 1.6X camera body such as the XT, 20D, or 30D you end up with a 160-640mm equivalent which is an impressive range by any standard. You can also add the 1.4X TC for a 896mm upper limit or the 2X TC for an amazing 1280mm. Of course this comes at a price, and I'm not just talking money. You will have to use a tripod, cable release, and mirror lockup a lot of the time when using such long focal lengths. Plus this thing is very heavy and very large and people will take notice. So if stealth photography is your goal, go with something like the 70-300 DO. That being said, this is an amazing lens, admittedly a little slow near the long end, but to get down to f/4 would have most likely doubled or tripled the price and weight, so it seems like an acceptable trade-off. If you want sharp pictures, an amazing zoom range, and a good workout, but don't mind being the center of attention, this is the lens for you 
I agree with all the others comments about this lens. It works great but it is big, heavy and attracts attention. When I say it attracts attention, I am not kidding. I was at an airshow taking pictures along with a lot of other amature photographers. My 100-400mm lens, however, attracted the attention of a local newpaper reporter who interviewed me. However, I bought it to use with my 20D at airshows and I can honestly say I am not disapointed. It was well worth the money. I also bought a cheap Kenko 1.5x teleconverter for kicks. While the converter isn't "L" grade, I am pleased with the results and the autofocus still works which I understand is not the case with the Canon TCs. For those looking for a big zoom lens and you want IS, you are ulitimately going to wind up buying this lens. 
I've only had this lens for a few days and I will say it has impressed me. It does have drawbacks, needs lots of light and is somewhat heavy. I would not like to carry all day,but for my need it isn't a problem. I have a couple of photos on display taken the first day I purchased the lens . It was a very overcast day and I think they turned out reasonable for the weather. My test at home when the sun popped out were outstanding. As for the push and pull adjustment I see no problem with it. I think with a little more experience it will be a very good purchase for my budget. I know there are higher quality lens but price becomes an issue,when you are a amature hobbiest like I am. I would recommend for any one who likes to take wildlife photos. The 5 star rating is for the money and quality it is a very good lens!   
This lens is super-sharp, colors come out vibrant, it has two IS modes, and is push/pull (some people don't like that, but your zooms are super-fast). This is probably the best Canon telephoto lens in terms of focal range. One bit of warning; it's not only fairly large and made of metal (not plastic), but it's kind of heavy -- while it doesn't weigh 50 pounds, be aware that it's NOT light. Carrying it around when attached to the camera, you carry the equipment by the lens, not the body 
I shoot with a Canon 20D and have used the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 III USM lens. I've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball. I reviewed the lens lineup at the Canon website and decided on the Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L USM Lens. Even so, I was apprehensive about the push/pull zoom system. Since this lens seems so expensive, I wanted to try it before I bought it. After renting the lens and using it over a weekend at a softball tournament, I knew this was the right lens for me. This is a serious lens meant for serious photographers. Being an L lens, there is a lot more features and is manufactured with better materials. The construction is sturdy and consists of 17 elements in 14 groups. The fluorite and Super UD-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum. This lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x II and 2x II. The Canon EF 100-400mm lens weighs in at about 3 lbs/1,380g, and accepts 77mm filters. Be sure to get a good quality UV haze filter. Being white, this lens looks a bit strange, but helps keep it cool when using in the sun. Some people are concerned that being white, it attracts attention to criminals. From my experience, my 20D attracts attention regardless of what lens I put on it. I personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload. I try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up. The dual IS system has two modes. Mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects. It is recommended that the IS function is not used on a tripod; however I have used it on my monopod with success. The IS helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle. While there are limitations to what the IS can do, it can give you a couple extra stops. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed. This lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. There is also a switch to shift from a 1.8m/5.9ft to infinity or 6.5m/21.3ft to infinity. Zooming with this lens takes a little time to get used to if you have never used it before. Once it is gotten used to, it seems to be much faster than the typical twist zooming. A resistance ring is used to tighten or loosen the resistance to zooming. This allows for practically locking the zoom in place or providing no resistance at all. Zooming is as simple as pulling or pushing the lens as its name suggest. The push/pull system causes air to be noticeably pushed around. Because air is pushed into the camera, there is a myth that the lens causes dust to settle and accumulate on digital camera sensors. I mostly use this lens in one of the dirtiest environments I shoot in for amateur softball pictures. Even so, my experience does not support the myth. I have not seen any evidence to support the myth from any reputable source either. Included with this lens are the Tripod mount, lens hood, and storage case. The tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod. This helps to balance the load. Mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over. The case is a zippered soft case (LZ1234) that can also be purchased separately. The lens hood (ET-83C) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations. The Canon EF 100-400mm is such an awesome lens, it almost fails to compare to the Canon EF 75-300mm. The clarity and sharpness is incredible. The auto-focus is quiet and quick. The features add creative versatility. The Canon EF 100-400mm comes at a price, but it is worth every bit of it. Now that I have both lenses, the Canon EF 75-300mm is no longer used. PROS: Incredible clarity and sharpness Quiet and quick auto-focus Features add creative versatility Dual IS system CONS: Heavy and bulky (This should be expected with these types of lenses 
Reviews of this lens on the web are mixed with some showing soft results, particularly at 400mm. This is likely due to wide variations in sample lenses. I decided to take a chance and seem to have gotten lucky. My copy, just received from Amazon (Build date of Oct 2005) produces fantastically crisp and contrasty images on my 20D at ALL focal lengths from 100 to 400. It's almost magical. The images are much sharper using the same f-stops than those from a 70-200 f2.8IS lens at 100-150mm and virtually the same at 200mm. Even wide-open at 400mm this lens is quite sharp. At 400mm, I've compared to a very nice Canon 400mm f5.6L prime lens, with and without 1.4X teleconverter. The images have virtually the same extreme sharpness and contrast if the zoom is stopped down just one one-third stop (e.g. zoom at 6.3, prime at 5.6). With the 1.4X TC both lenses had to be manually focused but produced outstanding clarity with NO perceivable loss in quality. The focus is swift and true and the IS on this lens really works (and does not hum like that on the 70-200 f2.8IS) allowing handheld shots at 1/100 sec at 400mm. It may be that Canon has quietly improved this lens since recent reviews seem to be much more positive than those from a few years ago. Some folks don't like the push-pull zoom but it works great for me and allows very fast composition of scenes. The lens is about the same size as the 70-200 f2.8 IS but seems lighter and better balanced. Given the razor sharpness of its images and 100-400mm range, this seems like the perfect single lens solution for nature and bird photography. However, it is big and white so it may not be the best for candid people photography. 
I bought this lense recently. At first I thought it was heavy, but once I got used to it, I decided that it was heavy due to quality. It is a big lense, and the tripod mount is very useful, especially for balance. You can't but notice the quality of this lense. The IS function is very useful. Combine this lense with the 2x Extender, and you've effectively got a 800mm lense. For anyone looking for a zoom lense, this is one to seriously consider. For sport, the IS function is brilliant, for wildlife ... well, I can go on and on about how good this lense is. Bottom line - well worth buying 
I have been very happy with this camera bag. The slingshot design works well and makes unloading the equipment far less cumbersome than a traditional backpack. I also like the features of the bag. It has all the great Lowepro niceties like a protective sewn-in cloth to cover the sensitive camera viewer before you zip it up, the waterproof covering for that unexpected downpour and compartments for the digital memory cards. It's a good buy 
I purchased the Lowepro Slingshot 200 to replace the Tamrac Adventure 7 backpack I recently returned to Amazon. I spent quite a few hours researching bags to use for sightseeing/hiking and had initially purchased the Tamrac bag b/c of its similarity (in style) to a regular backpack. A recent "L series" purchase has encouraged me to keep a low profile when transporting my gear. While the Tamrac bag certainly looked the part, its functionality left something to be desired. The Adventure 7 held my entire kit, which includes: Canon Digital Rebel XT, EF24-105mm "L", EF50mm EF18-55mm "kit" lenses, EX580 flashgun and the various hoods/filter/etc for the above lenses. Now the bad part, once strapped into its normal position, the only way to access your gear (in the Adven. 7 pack) is to fully remove the backpack, place it on the ground, unzip the zipper fully, then remove/replace the camera/gear you desire. This proved VERY cumbersome while on the rocky terrain of the "Great Falls" national park in VA (near DC), in fact, there were times when I gave up on a few nice photo opportunities simply b/c getting to the camera would have been too difficult. I do own a Lowepro holster, but by going that route, I would have limited my ability to bring alternate lenses/accessories. After some additional research, I decided to try the Slingshot 200. Let's compare the tow on some key points: Gear Capacity: Nearly identical for both bags Additional Capacity: The Tamrac trumps the Lowepro, it has nearly double the useable storage capacity, great for bringing along a snack, your keys, etc. Styling: Again, the Tamrac is a winner, looks like a standard backpack, versus the strange look of the slingshot Functionality: As a backpack, the Tamrac is much more comfortable, has greater storage capacity and even offers a waist support strap for longer trips. BUT, this comes at the cost of accessibility. The Lowepro slides easily around to the front. Simply unzip and your camera is right there. It also is a stable platform for lens changing/cleaning/etc. To summarize: For hiking/walking/etc where you need instant access to your camera and accessories, the Lowepro Slingshot 200 wins hands down. Pros: Instant access to your gear, includes all-weather cover (attached), nice attention to details (lens cleaning/protection cloth is a particularly nice touch), etc. Cons: Strange styling, not reversible (can only be worn on right shoulder), nearly impossible to carry hanging on one shoulder. 
I think I may have found the perfect camera bag. This one is comfortable to wear all day, it holds my Alpha 100 with my kit lens, my 100-400 lens both with lens hoods. My battery charger, manual, misc cables, wallet, phone, misc items such as a small rain jacket. It also has a little pocket for your memory cards. The best part of this bag is that you can swing it around to the front and pull your camera out without having to sit it down or showing everything you have in the bag. The bag is plain enough that most people wouldn't know that you have a camera and all of the equipment that goes with it. Which is a big plus with a women traveling alone 
This is a wonderful bag for the photographer that wants a light weight bag that can still hold a lot of lenses or bodies. The bag slings around to the front allowing the user to easily switch out lenses without having to unload the entire bag or worry about dropping an expensive lense. Also, the bag can hold a lot of accessories. I had to Canon Rebel XT bodies and 3 lenses in just the camera compartment. The flap that opens up to the user when the bag is on your chest has the memory card holder, but it hold 8 memory cards which is huge! The top has a small pouch where you can tuck away larger objects like a water bottle or map. The all weather bag cover is built into the bag so you do not have to worry about folding it up and storing it. The bag cover also has velcro pulls that latches it onto the bag so that it stays on insuring a dry environment inside the bag. Basically this is a top notch bag that can get through anything. Yes, I have actually used the bag on a few trips and find it very user friendy and reasonable 
This bag is very spacious and stylish. It holds my Rebel XT and my three lenses very well. I can even hold a 70-200mm f/4 in there, although it is a bit snug. The best part of this bag is that it is completely customizable. I have set it up in such a way that I can get to any one of my lenses just by slinging the bag around and unzipping only the top compartment. This is very useful when you don't want to constantly set your bag on the floor to access your equipment. I do have one complaint. When wearing this bag as a sling, it will sit on your right shoulder. I am more used to bags sitting on my left shoulder, so that does take some getting used to. When I carry this in "non-sling" mode (i.e. not over my head), it can comfortably sit on my left shoulder. However, the best and most unique feature of this bag is the ability for it to sling around and have access to the camera without taking the bag off, which is only possible if I wear it as a sling bag on my right shoulder. It would have been nice if that portion of the bag is customizable as well 
The case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only. Then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses. It makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera. You can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack. My digital Rebel XT fits with the Canon Battery grip and my macro lens attached, however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached. My Canon Speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag. The lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them. I bought a regular Lowepro camera bag, but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached. This bag is designed to have the camera with a lens. If you search Google images for the Lowepro Slingshot 200 you will see what I mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal.  
Great product. Compact, easy to use (took a couple of trys), feels good and was able to put two large digital cameras, four lenses and room for more. Love it 
This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. 
If you are a believer in protecting your expensive lens purchase with a filter than you can do a lot worse than a Tiffen filter. The glass quality is good and the price is reasonalbe. The filter cuts down on the glare that can adversly effect some shots with out an uv filter as advertised. Not much else to say. 
This UV filter produces high quality pictures at a fraction of the cost of many ather brands 
works as advertised. you screw it on the end of your lens, and there you go 
Great filter for the price-no reason to spend more. The filter threads are high quality, and it is possible to stack filters if you want-not recommended, though, if you are using it on a wide-angle, as I am. No vignetting, sturdy filter. 
A UV Filter is about as standard as filters get. Tiffen makes a good quality filter and this was just as expected. The price was equilivant to other vendors and as expected I had no problems; ordering was simple and the product came on time 
There are some of you who are reading this because you are wondering why should I pay more than a grand for this lens? Some may wonder if what they heard about this lens is true? And others may wonder if this lens has any draw-backs? First, let's look at the Canon product line. At one time I owned several Nikon cameras and believed in the Nikon product line strongly -- but that was with film. With technology quickly advancing and prices dropping on the digital front, I knew it was time to decide again -- Canon or Nikon? I happened to be visiting the national park at Fort Scott, Kansas. There was a traveling professional photographer there who had a digital Canon 5D. He showed me the myriad of L (luxury) lenses he had -- I stopped counting after SEVEN! "Why Canon over Nikon?" I asked. "They both have excellent product lines," he replied. "Every year their digital camera body designs keep leap-frogging each other in technological advances -- but I decided on Canon because of its lenses." Duh! Of course, it's the glass stupid -- I thought to myself. Based on his recommendation, I purchased a digital Canon 30D body (I will wait for technology to leap forward some more and pricing to take another drop before I invest in a more expensive body) and several lenses -- including the 24-70mm f/2.8L. As a semi-professional photographer, I took an assignment shooting a conference at a hotel in Las Vegas. Shots included vendors tables, speakers and awards' ceremonies. The rooms were dimmly lighted and a professional photographer who knew the hotel suggested that I take a flash even though he knew I would be using the 24-70. As it turned out, I needed but one lens for the entire shoot and it was the 24-70 with hood. The other gear I used was the 30D grip, the 580ex flash with the omni-bounce attachment and the CP-E3 compact battery pact -- all mounted on the Strobofgrame PRO-RL using a camera quick release system. Of course, all total, there also were 12 batteries: 2 camera, 4 580ex and 8 CP-E3. How did the shots turn-out? Did I really need the flash as suggested even though I had a fast 2.8 lens? First, I tried some shots without the flash and they turned-out okay, but a flash was needed for professional shots. So, how did the shots turn-out? Canon delivered what it promised! The shots turned-out beautifully! The auto-focus was fast and quiet. The color saturation was magnificient and subjects' skin tones were natural and vibrant. It was true with what I had heard about the 24-70 zoom -- the quality was so good that it was as if I was shooting with different straight lens with different focal lengths -- all in one lens! The lens' hood is large and impressive looking to those who are not into cameras. Even though it serves a purpose, the hood with its accompanying lens can make an amateur look like a pro! So why did I list all of the above equipment? Because in total it is HEAVY! You will need a grip on your camera to help balance this long heavy lens. I carried the camera with attached accessories around for some seven hours and at the end of the day my wrist/forearm muscles were tired! Yes, I know I could have had the battery pack attached to my belt rather than the frame -- but for flexibility I decided not to go that direction. And, frankly, I do not think it would have mattered. So, you are going to get quality with this lens, but beware of it being heavy for someone slightly built like myself. For this reason, there has been some talk about "image stabilization" being added to this lens, however, to date it is mere talk and, personally, I do not see it happening in the foreseeable future. Also, for me personally, because of its weight, I do not consider this to be a walk-around lens that I could carry with me for hours on-end. I know that many will argue with this statement and they probably are a lot physically stronger than me. So, do you buy the lens? In my opinion, it is a resounding "Yes!" with a couple of caveats. The price is high, but it keeps on increasing -- so buy it when rebates are available from the manufacturer. Also, do not pay the big bucks for this lens unless you are seriously into photography. Canon has many non-L lenses that can give you oustanding quality photographs -- sometimes there is a fine distinction between a photo derived from an L lens and a non-L lens. Unless you are looking at greatly enlarged photos, in many cases it will be difficult to see the differences. So, save your money and take advantage of Canon's other quality lens instead. Last, whatever you decide, enjoy capturing the moments -- life is short 
This is a fantastic lens. It takes crisp, rich photos, has a large apperature that makes for impressive low-light photography, and includes USM technology for lightening-fast focusing. Since I am only a serious hobbyist, I can't yet afford another quality Canon lens...but for 2 years I have been perfectly happy to leave this lens on the camera (a 10D). Portraits, landscapes, indoor shots with no flash...it can do them all with ease, and the photos look great. This lens is a little heavy, and combined with my 10D the weight is certainly a consideration. But to me it feels well-balanced on the camera, and I like the substantial feel that the lens-camera combination gives. If you plan to use a flash, remember that this is a big lens and the built-in flash may not clear the barrel (especially on the 10D, before Canon redesigned the pop-up flash)...might want to think about an external flash head for the hot shoe. There's a lot of glass on the front of this lens, don't forget the UV filter for a little extra protection 
Exceptional images! I can shoot indoors with low light due to the large aperture. The lens is a bit heavy though! I had to choose between this lens and the 24-105 F4L IS lens. I went for the 24-70 F2.8L for the wider aperture. I have no regrets! I do miss the additional reach of the 24-105 F4L IS lens, but this was a compromise that I was willing to make. Once again, excellent lens 
There is very little doubt that this is one of the better Canon lenses available. However, why buy from AMAZON when it did a price increase of $73 as soon as Canon starts the 2006 fall rebate program. AMAZON has officially become the most expensive online retailer for this lens. 
My all-around favorite lens in the Canon EOS system is the 50/1.4. I find that most of the time, most of the pictures I want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length, and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light. I bought the 24-70/2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens, as a lot of my pictures weren't in particularly dark places, and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing. I was not disappointed. The image quality produced by the 24-70/2.8 is outstanding. Great color, great sharpness. It might not make images quite as striking as Canon's 135/2 lens, but they are very good indeed. Does this lens replace the 50/1.4? No way. The 50 is a lot smaller, weighs a lot less, and is still much better for low light shooting. But for photographing events where you don't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better, the 24-70 can be a great tool 
I agree with all the positive reviews of this lens. It's a great lens, give's that certain silky smooth bokeh that the 24-105 lacks and gives a nice bright viewfinder. It does have a couple of quirks though- -It's very heavy so be prepared for that. A lens of this quality and high speed will need a lot of glass in there. -When you zoom out to wide, it actually gets longer which is a bit strange. Sometimes when you are taking a group picture and you need to zoom out a bit to fit everyone in the shot, the subjects see the lens moving towards them and think you are going in for a closeup. This can be partially remedied by using the included hood which masks the lens a bit and is always extended. 
This is a great lens. The pictures I take are very sharp and alive with color, and the brokeh is excellent. I am a big fan of keeping a shallow depth of field when shooting people or animals, so the f/2.8 helps out. Also dim wedding receptions are no problem with even the weak built in flash on my Rebel XT. The autofocus is practically silent, accurate and very fast. If you don't think you need f/2.8, go for the 24-105mm f/4 L IS. It has an extra 35mm on the telephoto end, image stabilization, and is lighter and smaller 
You are buying quality not price. Im amazed with the quality of the pictures I get with my new lens. It seems I changed my camera to a new model... totaly diferent pictures. I have compared to my previous cameras and lenses and WOW... I cant believe I thought I had some great pictures in my collection. I dont want to use my other lenses anymore, I have a new standard in my pictures. I have to say that it was a "crazy" decision to buy this lens because of the price, but this is an investment that once you have it you will enjoy and will last for many years. If you love photography and really like to go to full detail you wont regret it 
this is a wonderful filter. clean your front element, place this filter on it, and now you never have to think about it again. the thread fit is very good on both ends of it. the canon 67mm cap fits on the front of this filter perfectly. there's even a slight raised metal lip so that the cap doesn't sit against the filter glass. well engineered, and worth the money 
i am a fisheye lens addict. i have had this lens for a few months now, and i use it for almost everything. the lens was worth every bit i payed for it. and the sigma customer service was so fast and easy. the lens takes clear sharp pictures everytime. this lens takes the best skateboarding and band pictures! if you are considering this lens, i would definately reccomend it. i love how the pictures can either be circular or full frame. its a great investment...... 
Manufactured of a soft gray felt like material, a tough leather bottom, and draw string closure at the top, this lens pouch helps protect your lens from dust and the elements. I store my lenses in a camera bag, and these cases fit nicely around the lens taking up little precious space. This case is meant for use with the Canon 28 to 135mm f3.5-5.6 IS USM, and the 28 to 200mm f3.5-5.6 USM EF lenses. These lenses do not normally come with the case when sold new. Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering depending on how you store your lenses. PROS: Protects your glass investment CONS: I cannot think of an 
I already have 2 of the smaller versions for other lenses but wanted to be sure my EFS 17-85-mm would be snug as a bug in its own pouch instead of a cheap felt sling thing. Well, Canon came through again with another of its soft felt line the LP1116. This pouch is thick and has the same firm bottom made of naugahide that protects the inside lens. The cord is strong and silky and doesn't open accidently the way a silky cord would. Obviously we can't throw the pouch around and we have to be careful but it really does the trick and feels good in your hand. The moment I buy another lens, I shall have to buy its matching pouch 
This is my first review on here. Bought the marine pack for a houseboat trip for my Sony DSC-N1 camera. It is very solid and feels great. Somehow I mistakenly thought before obtaining it that the touchscreen could still be used when the camera was installed. Though that's not accurate, a good number of other functionality is retained (you can switch between movie/camera/review modes, zoom, etc.). It worked very well for the trip, and it took fantastic photos. We even took several movies going down water slides and diving into the water (which isn't suggested in the manuals) but still everything turned out perfectly. All in all, I'd easily recommend this unit 
The marine pack for the DSC-N1 is good enough to get the job done. The camera has a special housing setting to change the functionality of the camera so that it can be used in the case. Unfortunately, this means losing the ability to use manual settings. Luckily, the camera does fine figuring out its own settings, though occasionally to get the picture just right you need to do it yourself. I have taken the case to 130 feet several times and have never experienced a leak 
I have not actually taken this underwater yet, but it appears to be well made and of similar quality to other cases. It keeps the over-all size of the camera/case down to a size that could fit into a BC pocket. On the downside, it does have only limited functionality of the camera through the available buttons. You can zoom and telephoto, change from camera,playback and to movie mode and shoot the picture. You cannot do any of the setup functions while it is in the case. Regarding a stobe, Sony makes one that looks a little cheezy. There is a "universal" strobe by Sea Life (SL 960D) that fits, but the fiber-optic trigger is just taped onto the flash of the camera. I'm waiting to how this works. One replacement O-ring comes with the case-replacements from sony were outrageously expensive. Color-correcting (red) lenses are about $100 from sony, but not needed if you use a strobe. (unless maybe to shoot movies?) 
Great camera, easy to use, and great movie quality on video cam part. Bought a 4GB SD card for it, so photos are just about endless 
This is my first camera and I'm very happy with the choice I made. This camera has allowed me to take amazing pictures I wouldnt' dream of. I love accentuating colors and taking sepia or black white pictures of great backgrounds. It's certainly an aggregated value to the camera. Before I bought this camera I used to borrow my brother's, and I can say that mine is SO much better than his. The colors are more vivid, the images look brighter and I can shoot faster with mine. The only feature I miss from his camera is that I was able to cut the picture right in the camera. With my Canon I have to wait to get home, download the picture and then cut it. You should take another picture if you dont' like the first one. One other thing: the camera claims to have "Image Stabilized Zoom" but that didnt' work for me when I wanted to take the picture with no flash. I hope it was because of the lack of experience, and I'll try to improve my skills so I can come back and give you more details about that specific feature and about the camera itself. Still, knowing all this, I would buy this camera again 
I did a lot of research in picking out a camera and wish I had known about this camera before purchasing a Nikon P3 (with WiFi). I happened to receive a refurbished SD700 right before our honeymoon and took both to test them out. What better place than Kauai to take some great shots... So, after about the first day of shooting I came to the conclusion that the Canon was a better camera hands down!!! As a matter of fact it is the best camera I've owned and I'll never get another brand again. There were several things that set this camera apart from others: 1. Picture quality on scene modes (beautiful beach and floral mode) 2. Picture quality on auto (true sign of a good camera) 3. 4X zoom (unbelievable - best feature...took pictures of a lighthouse from a mile away and looked like I was right in front taking it. I also used camera as binoculars to see a mountain goat in Wimea Canyon and picture was unbelievably clear) 4. Battery life 5. User controls and software I really can't find anything bad to say about this camera. I didn't get a chance to even read the manual before our trip and figured out all the "bells and whistles" fairly easily. As a point and shoot camera, this Canon delivers a professional quality like no other! Definitely a great purchase 
With 2 toddlers, I'm the type of person who likes to have a camera with me to capture those unexpected moments on film. The ELPH cameras are ideal for this because they're small and lightweight. I used a 3.2MP Canon ELPH before this one, and I thought the 3.2 was good until I started using this new one. The clarity and stability control on the SD700 is great! And downloading the photos to my computer takes only seconds. I highly recommend this camera 
I gave this camera to my husband for his birthday. It is the first digital camera we have owned though my college age son is on his third one - all have been Canon digital Elphs. This is such a great little gadget - it is smaller than a pack of cigarettes, has a big screen on which to view your photo(s), is easy to learn to use, and great for taking on trips - as long as you remember to keep the wrist strap on your wrist while you are using it so it doesn't drop and break. I also purchased a small Canon digital printer which is great for us to take to our aging parents, take photos, print them immediately and leave them with our parents to enjoy immediately. Every Canon product we own has not disappointed us and this little camera is no exception! 
I love this camera. It does everything you'd want a compact point and shoot camera to do. Perfect for taking pictures of my toddler. Fits in your pocket and starts up in a split second. Never miss another "Kodak moment". 
Worth the money in every way. Sturdy, compact, great pictures, easy to use, easy to upload images 
I mainly use this when taking landscape shots where I want to either make the clouds pop or liven the sky up some (remember it works best 90 degrees from the sun.) I also put it on when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes that would otherwise cause blown-out highlights. One other little secrete is to use this when shooting waterfalls since it will allow you to shoot at slower shutter speeds thus increasing the wispy waterfall look. 
Obviously, I am enamored with the Nikon D80. As one who has extensively used the D100, D70s, and D200, I was curious as to how the D80 would "shake out" in comparison with these fine cameras. The answer is that it does very well indeed. The most obvious improvement in D80 over the D70s and D100 is the upgrade from 6.1 to 10.2 Megapixels--the same as its "Big Brother," the D200 This is not a major issue for many users, as a 6.1 MP image (uncropped) looks essentially exactly the same as a 10.2 MP image. However, if the user intends to crop images in post-processing, the larger amount of resolution becomes important--the more megapixels the more detail when images are cropped. Shooters of wildlife, for example, will appreciate the additional resolution of the D80, as it is often necessary to photograph wildlife at a distance and then crop the image to cause the subject to dominate the frame. The other very obvious D80 improvements are the larger viewfinder and larger rear-LCD. These are very welcome improvements, also borrowed from the D200. The viewfinder is wide, bright, and a literal joy to use. Combined with the 11-point autofocus system (basically the same as that of the D200 although with some differences in options) the viewfinder makes the D80 a powerhouse camera for moving subjects, or for framing the subject in places other than the center of the image. The autofocus is fast and sure. I literally never use manual focus with the D80--the autofocus is just too good not to use for almost every conceivable situation. The 2.5 inch rear LCD is bright and vivid--a joy to use. This too, as mentioned above, is borrowed from the D200. The menu selections in the D80 closely track those of the D200 and are largely pretty intuitive for anyone who is somewhat familiar with the Nikon system. A few nits. First of all, the D80 does not have a selection for focus-priority continuous focus mode. This is unfortunate, as such an option (present on the D200) allows fast action shots using continuous-focus with surety that the subject is, in fact, in focus. Happily, this absence (which I predict and hope Nikon will correct in a later firmware revision) is not a huge loss. I have shot hundreds of images of fast-flying birds using continuous focus with the D80 and the images are almost all perfectly focused. The user can trust the D80 in continuous focus mode, focus priority or no. Nikon chose to equip the D80 with SD cards rather than CF cards. Why Nikon did this is a mystery to many of us as the D80 clearly is an upgrade to the wonderful D70s, which uses CF cards. Further, the D80 is a fantastic backup camera for D200 users, and the D200, of course, also uses CF cards rather than SD cards. CF cards would have been a more logical choice in my opinion for the D80. Fortunately, the cost of these media is dropping so fast that this is less of an issue than it would have been a few years ago. The D80 sucks up power a lot faster than the D70s. That 2.5 inch LCD entails higher power use as a price. Most users will want to own a spare battery. As to ergonomics, the D80 is terrific! I have just finished an 8 day stay on Maui, Hawaii, during which my D80 was literally always with me. The weight of the camera is low, and its bulk, reasonable. There is no digital SLR I would rather carry for an extended period than the compact D80. The placement of the various controls is excellent, and pretty intuitive. The quality of the D80 body construction is standard Nikon-Prosumer grade, which is to say, excellent albeit not as heavy-duty as the metal-body D200. Overall, the D80 is destined to become one of the great Nikon cameras that will find a place with users all over the world 
It doesn't get any better at this price point. Excellent build quality, very easy to use, and intuitive. The optics are simply brilliant for a kit lense (135MM). Went from a Canon Rebel film SLR which I loved, but when I tried to move into the XTi, there was just no comparison between the XTi and the D80. You could immediately feel the difference in quality and functionality. And the auto-clean feature is absolute marketing crap from Canon. THe CMOS shakes off the dust, but then where does the dust go? Bologna feature, not to mention the Flash nearly knocks your eye out when it pops up on the Canon XTi. The D80 blows it away, and for it's price there is nothing out there better. If your in the market at this price point, or relatively close, just go for it. You WILL NOT regret this purchase. 
You are reading a non technical review from your average fun photographer. So don't expect a lot of technical stuff. I finally stepped up from a Fuji S9000. I have loved my Fuji cameras ease of use and the colors they produce. I was a little reluctant to spend the kind of money it takes to get into the D80. I am thrilled I did. I finally have a digital camera that when the kids do something I catch it as opposed to the camera taking the shot after they have left the room. Super fast. A few Saturdays ago I was outside in our wooded back yard taking pictures of the changing colors in the trees. When I went to take a shot the flash popped up. I said this isn't right the sun in filtering though the trees but I took the shot anyway. Wow the camera new what to do. Unbelievable photos. Easy to handle even with the pistol grip MB D80. I also sprung for the SB600 flash and a great two dvd training program on Ebay. So don't be afraid to spend a couple of grand for the D80 and accesories. You will be glad you did. Happy in Alabam 
I recently test drove a D200 and was impressed with the useabiity of the camera. It is almost perfect. When buying I opted for the D80 because it has a very similar feature-set for less cash. Which meant additional money for lenses. OK, it doesn't shoot 5fps or have the alloy body with weather seals, but it does have the sensor and useability. It is light, quick and a joy to use. Changing settings such as ISO, WB and flash is almost as easy as the D200. This is a fine camera. And it uses SD cards - much more preferable than CF in my opinion. Worth every penny 
I just purchased this camera and lens (with another lens in a different set) and it has blown me away so far. The pictures have been just incredible. The focus, metering, exposure, flash, color balance... Everything is perfect so far. I have mainly used the camera in full automatic mode and it really shines. Its as simple as a point and shoot in this mode. I have used the camera in difficult lighting situations and the photos have been incredible. There is no noticeable shutter lag, which is very important to me. I have a 6 yo son who goes from smiling one moment to looking away the next. I have missed so many photos in the past due to shutter lag, but that is not a problem with this camera. Another feature that helps is the continuous mode. I can take 3 pics a second for up to 100 pics and then select the best. Generally I find I can get a good pic in like 10-15 photos. I used to be a serious photo hobbist during the days of film, but always had problems finding a darkroom to develop my film. The darkroom issue and the shear cost of film and paying for processing made me abandon the hobby. But this camera is really bringing back the excitement of this hobby again without the trials and expense of the darkroom. The only downside in this camera is the price, but in this instance, you get what you pay for. You might be able to save a buck or two with another camera, but I wouldn't even try. I can't imagine a camera taking a better picture. By the way, I love this lens. The 18 to 55 mm focal length is a nice every day lens. Its much wider angle then you find on the point and shoot cameras, yet you can still get close. I have a 55-200 mm lens as well, but I find I use the 18-55 lens more. The shorter lens is great in confined spaces, where you can't easily back away from the subject, and its always better to move closer to your subject than use a long lens (unless you can't for safety reasons). My only regret is waiting so long to get a DSLR camera of this quality. It has really opened up a old hobby for me. 
I started with a D50 and have loved it from the very begining. I felt ready to step up to the next level, but didn't think I was ready for the d200. When I heard about the d80, I read everything I could. The biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body. I don't use all of the mode setting and find myself in Shutter and Aperture Priority most of the time, but it's nice to have the others there when I don't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings. The in camera image enhancements are amazing--but a word of caution. Vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots--if not too much so. I've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years. Compared to the Canon 30d (which I was thinking about) or even the new 400d (I haven't actually held one yet), this is the Nikon to have. On batter life, I had a recent shoot where I took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period. The battery was at about half and that's with quite a bit of LCD viewing. At this level both Canon and Nikon offer great equipment--you can't go wrong with either. Just get one of each in your hands, snap a few shots, and go with the one that feels the best for you 
This camera is awesome! I upgraded from my D50 for the better sensor and more MP. Wow - am I amazed at the increase in quality. Say goodbye to that digital look. The extras are a lot of fun and I've only begun to play. B/W with various filters to name one. Very worth the money 
After way too much time infront of a PC reading reviews or a camera store counter (damn I was sick of it), this D80 is what I chose. Bought it 2 weeks ago and then went on a 10 day trip West. After draging it everywhere I has not let me down. For the price its perfect. I'm still working out exactly how to make it work to its potential aswell as fighting understanding of other manufacturers camera layouts in my head) At work I have a Rebel Xt I bought last year as I need its compact casing. My Brother has the Canon D30 after he progressed from the XT and a friend on the west coast has the D200. Having experience both I still love what I chose. My biggest reason however for going again with Nikon was that I already have a N6006 film camera with a lens and my hope was I could use its Nikkor AF 35-105mm with this camera and give myself more options. After reading lots of reviews as to whether this was possible and finally taking the lens to a shop I found it worked fine. Experience in the field in the last 10 days has shown it does not work seemlessly buy that may well be me not the lens. The 2.5 inch LCD is sooo much easier to read than the Rebel XT. The info read out on top is much better placed than the one above the LCD on the XT (if obstructed in an architectural model shoot and I can't see through the viewfinder myself, I certainly can't see the info screen if its below it). I didn't go with the 18-135 in the end for a lens as there is a vinyetting issue at the high end which bothered me. I got a great deal for the same price at Cameraland in New Hampshire for the D80 and the (D70s) 18-70mm tried and trusted lens. Fab. Now need to save up and wait for the release of the 80-300 VR lens thats coming out. Would love the 80-400 Vr but its 3 times the price. My hardest time was finiding someone with it in stock, at a price I wanted to pay, the set up I wanted and who wasn't trying to make a dodgie deal (like some of those cheap web based places in NYC).It really was the hardest part of the purchase in the end. I was surprised. Many people were almost reluctant to make a sale. It was wierd. Parts are hard to get too apparently like a spare battery and very few places have the 18-135 lens instock either. Anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera. I hope it takes many great pictures for you. 
I've been looking at Digital SLRs ever since Canon came out with its 10D. Since then, there have been so many by so many companies. I've always been a Canon user. I have had 2 EOS bodies-the Elan IIE and the 7E. And also the Canon IX, its APS camera which I still have (its small viewfinder was a major disappointment). Anyhow the 30D came along, and its viewfinder was small too. The camera was still too large for me, and I just wasn't sold. Now the Nikon D80. It is narrower than the Canon 30D, and what is breathtaking is the panoramically big viewfinder. Such a delight to use. The 2.5" LCD seems to fit perfectly in the back: nothing bigger or smaller would be right. The pictures are fabulous. I bought a 2 GB Sandisk Ultra II card, which I thought would be fast. It takes about a half second for the picture to come on the LCD, but I'm not complaining. 2 GB is a big card. It can hold 500 photos using the Normal JPEG, large image. I'm sure the 1 GB would be faster. On the Canons, the onboard flashes never would use the advanced metering that the external flashes provided, but with the Nikon D80, I see such perfectly illuminated photos with the onboard flash. The 18-135 lens is something I jumped for. 28-200 in 35 mm size is quite a huge range, and yet the lens is not massive. I thought hard about the Image stablization you could get with the Canon 18-85 IS lens, but naaah, the 30D just does not measure up so I dropped that idea. There are always such things called tripods!! The entire camera, lens and battery feel just right, and not too heavy. The lens is excellent. The kit fits nicely into a relatively small Lowepro bag. This truly has been a camera worth waiting years for. 12 or 14 MP models are sure to come along in a couple of years, but I doubt that they can make the bodies any more compact; the file size is large enough as it is with 10 mega-pixel. The D80 is so perfect in shape I doubt Nikon can do much better. This is one fantastic digital SLR. Raj 
First of all I do not consider myself anything more than a very beginning photographer !!! So I will not go into anything technical. I will leave that to people who know more than I do. But what I am is an international traveler. I simply got tired of coming home from fantastic trips with "snapshots". I wanted someting much better, and boy did I get it with this camera. I looked at the D70s and since I have very small hands, I could never feel comfortable holding it. This camera is smaller without being small. I have only taken photos locally, but at this time of the year with the leaves changing it makes a good start. The built in editing features (filters etc.) are wonderful to work with. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something more than "point and shoot" snap shots 
I was in the market to buy a new camera last year and walked into BestBuy alone just browsing. I have an older EOS Canon Rebel 35mm Camera from 1992, and I loved that camera too. So this was my second camera purchase, and was not sure what I wanted, but I knew what I wanted to take pictures of. I take this camera everywhere, vacations, visiting friends and family, take pictures of scenery, sporting events, and people. There are a lot of options on this camera that I don't know how to use, but can't wait to learn them too. I upgraded my memory card to 1 GB so I can take a lot of pictures and not have to worry about running out of room. When I travel or go to a sporting event, I take anywhere from 75 to 200 piictures. I get a lot of compliments on the camera and the photos it takes are great 
The Canon G6 is a great camera. I upgraded from a Canon Powershot A80 to the G6. The A80 showed me that Canon makes a good camera, but was lacking a few features I really wanted. To me, this camera is a perfect collection of compromises. I want a small camera for family snapshots, that's easy to use. I want a large, capable camera for art work like portraits and landscape, and action shots like sports and recreation. When I'm on vacation, and want some snaps of the kids goofing around or of dinner or something, I don't need a camera that makes me jump through hoops to get a decent shot, I just want to point and shoot. In full auto, or aperature priority, or shutter speed priority, the pictures are usually sharp and crisp. Set the image size to one of the medium or small settings and you can use the high speed multi-shot feature to get a series of action shots that guarantee that you'll get at least a few good ones. I have no qualms about setting this camera to auto, handing this camera to a person with little or no photgraphic experience, and letting them click away. It's easy enough to learn that most folks can be taking nice pictures in less than an hour, and pros can be taking great pictures in no time at all. On the other hand, a lot of the work I do is very artistic, and involves using manual settings. When going for the perfect picture, it is often necessary to adjust the focus, aperature, and shutter speed to get the exact picture you want. This camera has manual focus, a feature I sorely missed on my older Powershot A80. Another thing that bothers me on most other cameras, is that you have to wade through a bewilderingly large collection of menu options to make the smallest changes. While I can understand using a layer or two of menus for things like basic settings (time, format a CF card) I can't see it for something as basic as film speed or white balance. Which is why I love this camera. The following items are one button away: Flash Flash Output Level Multi-image Time delay photo Autofocus area Macro mode Manual Focus White Balance Zoom in / out Film Speed (50 to 400) Picture mode (auto, Manual, Manual preset 1 and 2, Av, Tv, Portratit, Landscape, Backlit, Panorama, movie) My favorite things about this camera: Battery life is excellent. I bought a spare battery, but I've never actually use the one that came with it in less than a day. It charges fast too. Picture quality: The larger lens allows for better pictures in low light conditions, and it is very clear. The large CCD allows you to get pictures in a large enough resolution to print out fairly large copies and have them look very good. Ergonomic. This is a very comfortable camera to hold for a long time. It's not quite in the same range as some much more expensive units, but I've never gotten tired from holding it. Plus, all the buttons you need to hit while running it are right there under your fingertips. The scroll wheel under your right index finger is very intuitive to operate. Push it to change modes, roll it to change the settings. The fold out screen allows you to take pictures from odd angles without ever having to lay down on your back for a picture. Plus, the fold out screen feels very solidly built, not like it'll snap off in your hands. I was always worried about my Powershot A80, as it didn't feel very solid. It works well with my computer, which runs Linux. I use gtkam, a great camera program It has an infrared remote that can be used to take pictures without worrying about camera shake. This is very useful for group pictures you'd like to be in yourself. User savable white balance settings. Real flash shoe. This camera takes a standard Canon flash unit. Manual focus mode puts a close up of the center of the screen right in the middle of the picture for you to check the focus with. This would be really bothsome for composing pictures, except that when you half depress the shutter button, the small zoomed square in the center disappears and leaves you with the whole picture. The rapid fire photo option is very useful for action shots, and some candid stuff, like subway pictures. The mechanical view finder is more than just an adornment on this camera. It's quite good, and it changes its field of view according to the current zoom setting. It also has a focus adjustment on it. This is very nice if you wear glasses, as it lets you adjust the view finder to your eye, and you can get your eye right up to it, and not keep bumping your glasses into the back of the camera. Very wide open Fstop of 2.0 to very closed off 8.0. And lastly, it remembers virtually everything you setup the last time it was on or in a certain mode, and reverts to those settings the next time you turn it on or switch modes. This includes things like white balance, settings that were NOT remembered by my Powershot A80. Now for the negatives: The door that covers the USB port / DC input, and AV output is very easy to catch in the swivelling / revolving fold out screen, and as the screen takes a fare bit of effort to revolve, it's quite likely you'll have snapped the door in half before you notice it's gone and gotten itself caught in the spinning LCD screen that's passing by. If it's gotten a little bent, it will get caught every time by the fold out screen until you snap it off or bend it back in place. The flash is way too close to the lens, which makes for some pretty obvious shadows in the bottom right hand corner of some photos. Luckily, I'm not much for flash usage, and if I was, I'd probably spring for a real flash that sat in the hot shoe. Still, if you're looking for a great built in flash, this is NOT the camera for you. Slow focus, and the autofocus can become confused by objects within a few yards, and never really focus. Plus, focusing is pretty slow. If you are looking for a camera with a very fast, nearly perfect autofocus, you might do better with another camera. Movies are limited to 3 minutes maximum, which seems rather arbitrary. Even 5 minutes would be a big step up, as it would allow me to catch the average musical performance in one step. Final Word: This is a great compromise camera for someone who really wants two separate cameras but can't afford them. It's a good snap shot camera, and a good big lense, big body, big CCD machine capable of creating art. It's not the best at either of those categories when compared to other cameras, but for one that does both, it represents a a perfect compromise at a pretty reasonable price 
I am by no means a pro at taking pictures, but this camera makes me look close to it. So far I have just used it as a point and shoot and the pictures have been of really good quality. I am tring to learn more of the functions and one I have run across so far that I enjoy is you can choose in certain functions for your photo to be black and white, color, or sepia. I am not high tech but I can use this camera pretty easily. My first digital camera was a canon digital elf with only 3.2 mega pixels and there is a huge difference in the quality of the pictures when you compare. So if you can affored to spend more for more mega pixels do it. The only down sides I have seen so far is it doesn't come w/ a great memory card which most do not and I imagine if I did not have small hands that the camera would be a little awkward to handle. It has lots of buttons and dials so you have to hold just right so that you don't hit any. But overal I am very satisfied w/ my purchase and hope to become a better photographer with the help of this camera. Canon cameras have served my family and I very well over the years 
Incredible quality and zoom! Low power consumption. Buy the 1GB SanDisk compact flash card. It gives you plenty of room for a 2-3 week vacation 
A camera more for the advanced photographer with a very detailed instruction booklet. Takes excellent photos in auto mode. Memory chip included is not near big enough 
This camera does all that Canon says it does. Fantastic pictures. Great flexibility for manual control or simple point-and-shoot use. I did a lot of research before buying, and I could not be happier with the Canon G6 
This is my third digital camera, but it's been a few years since the second and it was definitely obsolete. I was tempted to go top of the line, because I've two excellent SLRs (Nikon and Minolta) with all the trimmings, but the prices made that unfeasible right now. I'm very satisfied with the features of the Canon G6 however; I've taken about 400 shots so far, plus one movie, tried out all the software for stitching panoramas together, etc. I still mainly use PhotoShop, but the Canon software is quite good. The photo quality is excellent, including color and the optical zoom and wideangle range is good for most purposes. The macro setting also does a nice job. The controls are easy to use for the most part for anyone at all familiar with full featured SLRs, and better than most. I've made very few mistakes in the field as a result of control confusion. What I'm less thrilled about (nitpicking): Like most electronics these days, even if you've got very small hands like me, it is hard to keep from getting a finger in the wrong place, just about every square inch is covered with a control. I would have liked to have an insert (like Nikon supplies) to cover the flash hotshoe contacts. And every time I remove the battery or memory card, I have to watch out to grab the camera by the few areas that don't have a control on them. Also, the cable input has a typical tiny plastic door that would be all too easy to break off, and the neck strap attachment is too close to the memory card door, and tends to interfere with it opening all the way. Also, in preview mode it tells you how many shots you have taken but not how many left, and in shooting mode, vice versa. It is annoying to have to switch to shooting mode to see how many left, especially if you are using the lens cover, because then the lens deploys out, and you have to remember to take the lens cover off first (deploying the lens with the cover on is a no-no.) I also got the camera case designed for the G6. Again like all too many "cases" it is a tight fit, only has a single inside pocket that you can only get an extra card in and still get the camera in too. And the case would not really be good dust protection and it zips up the sides but the top opening is just covered by a flap. And because of the tight and awkward fit, it is easy to accidentally turn the camera on, deploying the lens, while putting the camera into the case. The case comes with a belt loop, but you have to supply your own belt, and it has no other strap or handle except a tiny loop located at the top end of on side zipper, where it just gets in the way. Not a good design. I also checked out some of the accessories available, like additional lens and flash, but they're very expensive, like the macro lights are more than the camera! So I don't know if I'll get any of the add-ons later on. But overall, the G6 is already my next favorite camera to my Nikon SLR, powerful yet easy to use, and even fun! Definitely 5 stars for the camera, 1 star for the case 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
I would highly recommend buying a Canon battery over an after-market brand. I have bought two non canon batteriesfor my powershot S30 and both failed to last as long as the original canon battery 
This is a must have product for any Digital Rebel XT owner. Always carry a spare fully charged battery. Amazon has a competitive pricing structure and very timely delivery 
I've been using these in the Rebel XT since about two weeks. On Friday I went to a show at a local bar and took about 600 shots in medium to low light conditions (just small stage lights lighting up the band) and finally killed the battery after about 2 1/2 hours/600 shots 
This item is a good companion to use as battery backup; I recommend this item to all people using a Digital Rebel XT. This battery has a long life after full charge, is very light and small piece you can accommodate into any pocket or bag, I'm very satisfied with this purchase 
I have a Canon ZR700 camera, it comes with one of this batteries. Since it was just giving me a little more than an Hour of recording, i felt i needed an extra battery. When i saw the options, because the high price on this product, i felt tempted to buy a OEM battery that's cost was 16.00 USD with shipping and it has good reviews from other customers. But them i found the Canon BP-2L14 here at Amazon, which gives twice the power for only 56.00 USD, just 13.00 USD to double the power and a original product (and double the size too, the only bad thing about it, but it is really not that much) 
Very good rechargable battery pack.Holds charge for a long time even if camera is not used much. Capable of taking many shots with plenty of review time. Very pleased with it 
I find Canon batteries work very well. I also do not mind not using AA - an extra NB-2LH is small and easy to carry around - easier than several AA (rechargable or not) 
I am certainly happy I bought this filter kit. For a starting photographer, the price was right, and I have not noticed any quality issues. The UV filter stays on a lens at all times, as it's cheaper to replace the filter, than it is to have a scratched lens element repaired. The light polarizer is very handy, and also works very well, cutting down greatly on glare. I have not yet had the occasion to use the warming filter yet. The filter case is a nice extra, it fits right in my camera bag, and is out of the way untill I need it 
I received the lenses and they were all good quality. The case that comes with them is also very nice. I was worried about the polarizing lens not working after reading the other reviews,but mine worked fine. 
I purchased this set, and upon arrival, I found the circular polarizer to be defective. Amazon quickly replaced the set, and this polarizer did not work either! I returned the set, as I am not going to waste any more time trying to get a polarizer that works. I'll pay more, and get a quality product from a different maker. I will say that Amazon is second to nobody for customer service. I appreciate that, and will continue to be an Amazon customer. However, I can't say the same for Tiffen. 
Great kit! I haven't used any filters before but I can tell that I'll be using these quite a bit 
This is one of the best bargains that i've seen, "essentially" you get 3 filters for the price of one. The image quality with these filters is great, the 812 (warming) filter is by far a favorite giving back the color richness that flash photography so often washes out, that is unless you have the patience for constantly tweaking your flash power. Aside from the 812 the UV protector is basically a clear protective filter. While it obviously has advantages over clear glass, I tend not to think of it as any different. This too is a great filter which I use about half the time because it doesn't affect color hues or change f stop values too greatly while it takes the worry out of carrying the camera around ready for any candid shots that may occur. Finally included is the circular polarizer. This filter adjusts the amount of uv light entering the camera by spinning the filter to the direction the uv rays are entering (or turning the thingy till things look better). This lens is great for sunny days and will take surface glare off lakes and glass making them transparent again. It also makes colors more crisp in general when photographing buildings and other large "reflective" man-made things. So things sound great so far, but now to why I only give this item 4 stars. While Tiffen is known to be one of the best at photo and video filters, they have quality control issues that do no live up to thier reputation. In my case the 812 filter arrived with a discoloration in the glass. While it was didn't hurt image quality, with the flaw being towards the edge of the filter, I none the less didn't want to find a situation in which the flaw would diminish quality. Seeing as it was not amazon's fault my first e-mail went to Tiffen for a replacement which they said they would gladly do, but only after I send them the filter and they recieve it would they ship my replacement (not an option in my circumstances). Instead Amazon's wonderful customer service shown through again, and within 3 days they had replaced the entire set. The second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters were in perfect condition I traded just the 812. I havn't had any other issues and i'm very satisfied with my filters. The only other word of warning would be to that of the circular polorizer. While I recieved 2 that were flawless occassionally I have read in reviews customers have received ones that were assembled backwards making the lens useless. A quick way to check to see if your CP is working correctly is to hold it, thread facing yourself, and look at an LCD monitor or TV and spin it until the picture dissapears(obviously working correctly). I still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what I do now, chances are everything will show up perfectly but none the less if you're concerned order it before you need it and check everything over carefully. Amazon is always the best for returns and will often ship a replacement the next day with overnight shipping 
This was an outstanding value. The kit includes three often needed filters as well as an excellent filter wallet. The wallet itself, along with the included Tiffen Booklet is an added extra value. I found it to be a great value for the money. You get all three for less than the price of one filter and the filter wallet is an added bonus. 
These are great filters and especially for the price! I was looking for just one UV filter, and after stumbling upon this set which was not much more than the price of one filter, I bought it. These are great lenses. I especially like the polarizing filter, but all 3 are great. definitely a worthy buy 
After getting the SD600 as a gift, I knew I had to get a case for it. I really didn't like any of the cases at the store and wanted something that has a custom fit. This case is completely solid and the camera fits snugly in it. I have no problem taking the camera in or out but it does not have any wiggle room while it is in the case. Also the case has a magnetic button close for added security. Overall, a great buy 
This camera case is exactly what I was looking for. It fits my Canon SD600 perfectly. It fits like a glove- not too big, not too snug, and it does not scratch the LCD screen. It's really cute and is a nice punch of color in contrast to the basic black that is every other camera case out there. I've gotten a lot of compliments on how cute it is. I definitely recommend this product! 
This case is perfect for carrying and protecting my camera. Can't imagine not having it 
Just what I expected, since this is the second one I have purchased. I have one, and bought a camera and this case for my daughter. The case protects the camera lcd screen, but is still small enough to fit in a pocket or easily in a purse 
love it, it fits my SD450 perfectly. it's snug and durable and fits great in my purse when i bring it with me. i definitely recommend this!! 
I love this product! The case is slim enough to carry around in a purse without taking up all the room. The red color is fun, too! 
this case is freaking awesome. i was completely turned off by the 8 dollars shipping i had to pay, but it was definetly worth it. this case looks so nice, so sleek, so beautiful and it just feels good in your hands. u will love this case. i did. borrow a dollar from 8 ppl if u have to just for shipping 
I like the color. It fits the camera perfectly. It's really cute and not bulky. It's not just the ordinary black camera case that everyone else has. It's classy 
after searching on the internet i found amazon to be the place where this item had the lowest price. fast delivery, great product. fits great with my panasonic 6 megapixels camera. fine leather. could not be any happier with the product 
I mainly use this when taking landscape shots where I want to either make the clouds pop or liven the sky up some (remember it works best 90 degrees from the sun.) I also put it on when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes that would otherwise cause blown-out highlights. One other little secrete is to use this when shooting waterfalls since it will allow you to shoot at slower shutter speeds thus increasing the wispy waterfall look 
Need to clean your Digital SLR's sensor? This is the besy way to do it -- in conjunction wtih Sensor Swabs -- as canned compressed air can add "junk" which can make your sensor worse 
Great Kit, and I use it a lot. First, here's what's inside. SMALL rocket blower - great little thing, tends to whistle through the red plastic tip though. so, it's not great in quiet places. Retractable brush - great little thing, tends to shed hairs, but not terribly. Cleaning Solution - i did notice it lifted some color off of a multicoated lens. oddly, it only did that on one lens, and only once. the lens looks fine, and still takes sharp pictures without any flare. jury's out, but i still use it w/o fear. Cotton Swabs - never used em, but they look nice. Microfiber cloth - nice full sized cloth. very soft, and great when buffing out the spots 
This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. 
Just use this to protect the lens. Good cheap alternative to a scratched lens 
Beware of assuming that the UV filter recommended by Amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that I purchased is the correct size. It wasn't even close. No size was given for the lense diameter. I returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping all the hassel of packaging it 
This little camera may be small (great feature) but it is loaded this goodies. This is my first adventure into digital photography and I would recomend this one to any first time user. Very easy and lots of fun to use. 
This camera is very slim like the Canon Elphs but costs much less. It has very high resolution and is easy to use. The battery lasts a long time and the 2.5" LCD screen is very clear and big. It has a lot of different shooting modes, including a custom mode where you can set specific parameters like infinity lock or ISO speed. For convenience, every time you switch modes, the screen tells you what the mode should be used for, so you don't need to carry around a manual to figure out how to shoot your pictures. 
PROS: - The picture quality is very good, but a 7.2 megapixel picture is about 3mb wich is pretty big and thats a reason you might want to buy a bigger memory card. - Big 2.5" LCD that can get you some attention from bystanders around you. - The video mode in High Quality is very good! This feature impressed me, and i use it the most ( depening on the occasion ). This camera has better resolution than my brothers sony camera recorder. For some reason my baterry seems to drain a little faster than taking pictures. ( I own a 2GB Memory Stick Pro Duo, wich is enough to record and take pictures for a day, but i don't think the battery will hang in) CONS: - There isn't that many cons for me, becuase i was looking for a point and shot camera with a 2.5" LCD or 3" - The only thing i didn't like about video mode is that you can't zoom while recording, other than that this camera is a nice and great pocket camera. - Pictures come out blury at times when you are really shaky but sony does a pretty good at image stabilization. (This is also a great sport camera wich you can capture pitures of a fast moving object. 
This works just as described. As long as flash i-red beams see eachother it works fine... But radio controlled flash is much better 
I have a 580ex and it works great. I was hopeing that it would work for a studio light but nope so dont try it. The only thing you have to be mindful of is the distince that the flash is from the subject 
We really like this camera! It's a WHOLE lot better than our previous one, which ran off 4 AA batteries, and ran THROUGH so many AA batteries so quickly that we can't even guess how many $$ that wasted. This Optio camera uses very nice rechargable batteries that cost $5 each through Ebay (don't buy them here on Amazon... ouch!) We've got 3 batteries and are getting two more so that we never even have to worry about power while on a long trip. (The really handy travel charger is also awesome... get it on Ebay for just a few bucks.) The startup time and shutter speed are very fast, so catching quick pictures is finally possible for us. (My wife no longer threatens to go back to film after using this camera!) Our last camera would take so long to focus that we never got the candid shots we wanted. The one and only thing that's even a slight problem with this camera is the power button being next to the shutter button. (What clueless engineer thought THAT would be good??) However, now that we've used it a lot, we never hit the button by accident. All other features of the camera are great. With a 1 GB memory card, we've never ever run out of memory space, even with taking lots of short videos and many many pictures on medium quality. Great camera, worth every cent. Buy the accessories on Ebay and you'll find that getting everything you need is not very expensive at all. (Actually, we bought the camera on Ebay too, but these reviews are great here on Amazon. Thanks, Amazon! 
this is a great camera for traveling, it is small enough to fit into your top pocket, so it can go anywhere. the only problem that i have is that there is no underwater housing for it, if there was i would have given it a 5* 
I have been through 6 cameras in the past 3 years, of all different kinds of brands and price. I have changed so many times because they get stolen or broken...this little pentax optio was surprising though! 3 months after having it around, i brought it to the desert and it got some sand in it, but I had it fixed. THis same camera also fell three floors down and nothing was damaged; neither the screen, the lens, nor the flash. it just got cracked a bit and twisted, and the battery/memory card cover is completely damaged, but it still works like it should! 
I have had this camera a year now and am VERY impressed. I have used Nikon 35mm SLR's all my life so I was a little hesitant going into digital. Lugging around equipment became too much of a issue so I started looking. Picture quality is great even at full optical zoom. I very rarely use the digital zoom. Most impressive...the camera has taken 2 direct hits on the concrete and (8 months ago) and still works perfectly! 
I hear a lot of grumbling about the camera not being "perfect." But guess what ... in this size and form factor one should not be expecting SLR-like performance. I just purchased this camera last week and have been busy testing it out in a variety of situations. The "Full Auto" mode does a pretty decent job of figuring out the right settings for most situations. If you want you can take total control and set most controls manually. There are even a bunch of pre-programmed setting for different lighting situations and the couple that I tested worked great. All in all, great camera for the size. I like the fact that I can put this in my shirt pocket and forget about it and then when I suddenly need to take a picture I always have the camera handy. I have a normal speed SD Memory card and writing out the images to the card can be painfully slow. This is especially true when trying to take a number of quick shots in rapid succession. The wait for the camera to become ready to take the next shot is annoying. I would highly recommend that you purchase one of the high speed SD cards (often advertised as "Ultra II" or "32X" or "High Speed." All in all a great camera and if you are realistic with your expectations you will be very happy. Good luck 
I bought this camera a couple months ago because I wanted a small digital camera that would be easy to carry with me. Since then, I've found the S5i to be a wonderful camera that takes clear colorful pictures and can easily fit in your pocket. Here are some praises for the S5i: 1. This camera is TINY. It is smaller than my cellphone. This makes it extremely easy to bring with when going on a trip or just out for the day. I have it in my pocket at all times, ready to capture any moment. I brought it with on a recent trip and everybody thought it was great. At the end of the day we hooked it up to the TV in the hotel and watched a slide show of the day. Everyone loved it. 2. The battery life in incredible. I have had this thing for a couple months and I have only charged it like 4 times. Even with extended use of the flash and screen, the battery still keeps kicking. Very different from my cellphone! 3. The super macro focus setting creates beautiful photos. This was something I didn't realize the camera had until after I bought it. You can get right up to things and take these really colorful and crisp images. Flowers and plants look incredible. 4. The red-eye reduction is the best I've ever seen. With the red-eye flash mode, the camera flashes once and then about a second later flashes again and takes the picture. None of my pictures suffer from red-eye anymore. The flash is also very powerful. 5. It has many manual settings for more artistic pictures. I still haven't even gotten to check out all the little features this camera comes with. It has a lot of different "scene" presets and also allows you to do manual mode (with focus exposure). Overall, this camera met and exceeded all the expectations I had. I would definitely recommend the Pentax S5i to a family member or friend. 
I've had this camera since just before Christmas 04. I purchased from www.bhphotovideo.com for about $350. I should have waited until after the holidays, because the price has come down. It is great to finally have a small camera. I often forget that I even have it with me (which I guess can be bad!). Over all the pictures are good. The focus is sometimes soft. It doesn't take good night photos, but takes great daytime pics 
A very good accessory to have, protects the lens, and helps in taking very good pictures in some special situations 
Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shapped three and three quarters inch long offers some protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. There is nothing more irritating than reviewing your images to find dust spots or other flaws. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing or replacing an expensive L lens. This hood is manufactured for the Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS EF lens and normally comes included with the lens when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. Fortunately Canon provides a storage case with the lens that can be used in addition to your camera bag. While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. PROS: Improves contrast and image quality Offers limited protection to the lens CONS: Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the len 
Excellent product.Works as expected. Like all lens hoods though pricey 
This bag is great for active photographers. It doesnt matter how you store your equipment because the straps are velcro, to come off for moderate adjustments. for me my lifestyle in photography leads me many times up highplaces for my photos, I have tried many different types of bags for what i needed. mainly shoulder straps and this one is the best so far it keeps the contents of the bag very well protected and has so far not been affected by snow/ice or mildew/rain i am very pleased and would recommend this bag for anyone who would want alot of room for everything they'll need and more 
I'm really pleased with this bag, it holds all my gear with room to spare. There are enough adjustable straps to fine tune the bag to your comfort level. It stays nice and tight against my back and doesn't feel like a burden at all. This is a great value compared to some of the other options. The only drawback to this bag is that there isn't a convenient way of grabbing your camera without taking the bag off and opening it up. Other than that, no faults 
This is a great back pack! If there is anything I would change it would be the logo on the front. It's brite and shinny, and I'd rather not advertise that I have a camera in there! I colored it in with a felt pen and it works great....... Overall, I love the backpack!! 
I like the bag. Pleanty of pockets and pouches for all my little small accessories. Just wish it were a little better suited for 2 cameras like I have. But, everything fits...comfortable to haul around all day. Nice pads and straps to secure it to my back. Well padded for the equipment. I'd highly recommend it to anybody 
I love this backpack! It is just what I needed to safely carry my camera gear and keep it organized 
I needed a camera bag with greater portability, comfort, and security for athletic venues as well as being in the outdoors (i.e. mountains, valleys, trails, etc.) This bag delivered. I can fit my two primary lenses, a telephoto, an external flash, a colapsing tripod and my camera with room to spare. I can even attach my monopod to the side if needed. I like pockets so the extra internal zipper pockets plus the exterior side and front pockets are great for tucking away all of the extras too; like lense cleaning suplies, batteries, and memory cards. The backing and shoulder straps are nicely padded so it wears comfortably as well. When I purchased the backpack I planned to only use it for more "active outings" but have since found myself using it in place of my original camera bag 
My husband and I recently bought this bag to take on a trip to Mexico. It was perfect, fit our video camera, small digital camera, Canon Digital Elph, 2 lenses and all the chargers and accessories we needed for the trip. Plus, the tripod!! Also my husband used it for his carry on bag which was helpful given how tight airport security can be these days. I totally recommend this bag to someone who travels with several different pieces of photographic equipment 
I humped this thing around DC last week for 7 hours, and not a worry to mention. Well balanced, I had it full of a camera, 4 lenses, flash and miscellany. I cut all the extra straps off, and just have the shoulder harness left. And it looks good too. Of course, it's a great advertisement for thieves so never let it out of your grip. 
this item is great.... i love it...i have my 35 mm and digital camera in it along with everything else i need.. 
I am THRILLED with this lens's capabilities and the pictures it does. I test shot a corner of a window to determine if it would be good for my insect shots that I like so well. I bought this add-on converter and am thrilled to have added this and the 50mm lens of these necessary items for my set-up. I like nature photography the best and like to use my off summer days for hiking and finding photographs to take in perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles and subjects is what I like to specialize in. This lens will greatly enhance your experience in that 'little world' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away. I built a diffuser using a ping-pong ball over the flash so the lighting would work better. (Works great, btw). As usual, it's great Canon glass that does the trick. 
I've shifted from my previous Canon Powershot G2 to this wonderful DSLR, the Canon EOS 400D (or Digital Rebel XTi) and so far I have all praises. Though my G2 took great pictures, there's a mile of a difference a DSLR can deliver. The quality and clarity of each shot instantly makes your pictures look like they have been taken by a professional. The Rebel XTi's handling is deja vu for me because I used to have a Canon EOS 300 (or a Rebel). But its a big leap for me in terms of the plethora of functions and features as compared to my camera of the past. I always bring along my camera just in case I see a moment worth capturing. You can see some of my pictures at [... 
I'll keep this short,as I assume most of the tec stuff has been covered.I sold a 350D to get the 400D(XTi).The 400D focuses better,has better ergonomics,is the same size/weight,and takes GREAT photos.I tried a Nikon D80,but it loses way too much detail at iso 400 and up.Plus the Canon line of lenses fits my needs better,are cheaper,and are available.The Nikon costs $300 more (with the Canon being discounted),and the Nikon Raw converter adds another $150.So the true cost difference is $400-450. I'd buy the Canon over the Nikon at the same price due to image quality,especially if you shoot jpeg. BTW,if you can afford Canon L lenses(the 25-105L and the 70-200L-any of the 4) are amazing. One caveat,as with ANY dslr,these cameras are not p/s and do best with some post processing and with knowledge of how a camera meters/exposes,etc.I can't emphasize this enough 
I had the Rebel XT and about 8 lenses and was thinking of getting an upgraded second camera body. So when it came out the 30D was a logical choice, but it was not really much of an upgrade from the 20D, which I resisted, so I was not really sure what to do. Then I had all but decided to just take the plunge and get the 30D when I heard the first rumblings about the XTi. Then I started to learn the details about the XTi, more mega pixels, same auto focus, same screen, picture styles, dust cleaning! The only areas that the 30D won in my opinion were build quality, spot meter, and estimated shutter life. Those 3 categories were not enough to convince me that the 30D was worth $300-$400 more than the XTi especially since the XTi had won or tied in most categories. The way I look at it is that the camera bodies are not nearly as important as the lenses, they change so fast that it is not worth it to me to spend more for longevity when it will be outdated in a year anyway. Spend $1,500 on a lens, use it for a lifetime, spend $1,500 on a camera body, regret it in a year. I fully expect the upgrade to the 30D to be released within a year, and now that I have saved by getting the XTi I will have all that much more to put towards it when it comes out. So basically what I am saying is that, in my opinion, the XTi is just as good, if not better than the semi-pro 30D, so why pay more? Switching from the XT to the XTi was very simple, I can use them both now without any problems. The batteries, battery grips, remote shutter release, and most of the other accessories are also compatible with both, which is nice to keep the amount of gear you need to carry to a minimum. Unless you want to move up to a full frame sensor, I can't see any reasons why you would not want to go with this camera. If you read books on photography from just 1 or 2 years ago you will realize that this "entry level" camera has features that were not even available on top of the line ($5,000+) camera bodies. With the speed that camera bodies advance you might as well buy the entry level body every year instead of making a huge investment in the pro level bodies and then being shown up by something 10% of that price in a year or two. Not that there are not reasons to buy one of those bodies, I just don't seem have any of them 
XTi is feature laden, but takes fantastic "point and shoot" photos. Seems to be a significant improvement on Canon's Rebel XT, a wonderful camera. For the money, the best SLR going 
With emphasis on portability, Canon's Digital Rebel XTi is designed for first-time DSLR photographers and travel enthusiasts. Measuring 5.0" by 3.7" by 2.6" and weighing 1.1 lbs., it is about as large as the largest point shoot cameras and one of the smallest DSLR camera bodies on the market. Its size is the source of both popularity and criticisms. If you have large hands or a heavier lens, it may feel too small. An optional battery grip can help, but some will want something more substantial. Visit a store nearby to find out for yourself. The package includes camera body with a lens cap, battery, charger, manual, catalogs, neck strap, USB and composite video cables, and CD-ROMs. You will need a lens and CompactFlash memory card. There may be some static energy in the packaging, so remove the lens cap in a dust-free environment such as the bathroom to prevent dust entering the sensor. Much promoted sensor cleaning system helps, but it's best not to get any in the first place. Canon sells 4 versions of XTi: black or silver finish and with or without EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens. Black or silver is largely a personal preference, but most lenses, most accessories, and all but low-end DSLR camera bodies are black. As for the kit lens, it can be an affordable introduction to DSLR and capable if used exclusively at f/8 or f/11 apertures (soft at other apertures). In other words, the lens is not ideal for shooting under low light. If you don't have to get a zoom lens now, start with Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II. It is famous for top-notch performance at very low price. Due to XTi's APS-C image sensor (compositions are multiplied by 1.6x), this lens becomes 35mm-equivalent of 80mm. If you have the budget for a good zoom lens, at over 100 lenses, Canon has you covered. Some of Canon's popular zoom lenses include EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM, EF 17-40mm f/4L USM, EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM, and EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM. If these are too pricey, third party vendors such as Sigma and Tamron make Canon-compatible lenses for less. Their focus is not as nice as Canon's USM but they generally outperform Canon's lower-end lenses.Tamron's SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 Di II LD Aspherical (IF) and Sigma's 18-50mm f/2.8 EX DC and AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC macro are popular among budget-minded photographers. With 10.1 megapixels image sensor, the XTi can benefit from sharper lenses. Although increasing the resolution over same image sensor area can increase noise, Canon has improved the sensor technology to maintain low noise floor and high dynamic range. Performance wise, there's very little to criticize. Great example of Canon's trademark smooth, high contrast, saturated, and low noise. Noise remains low even at ISO 800. It is said that shooting RAW is equivalent to getting an extra exposure (1.0 EV) and it can help you maintain usable details with acceptable noise at ISO 1600. Low noise gives XTi a bit of an excuse for missing in-body image stabilizer. According to Canon, lens is more effective location for image stabilizer, especially telephoto. That's true but I think the feature would've been nice to have. As a consolation, the XTi has mirror lockup that reduces vibration caused by the mirror movement. My sole performance criticism is the metering mode. It includes only partial and not spot metering mode (very useful when shooting high contrast scenes such as candlelit birthday cake). Perhaps more problematic is the evaluative metering mode, which occasionally underexposes images by 2/3 EV or so. Some have criticized XTi for "plasticky" build. Except for the metal lens mount, the exterior is largely made of high quality engineering plastic with rubbery paint. If you drop it, it will probably crack or break, but it's sturdy and well made. Flipping on the power lever, it starts up almost immediately ready for use. Much promoted auto sensor cleaning kicks in when powering up and down. As with most DSLRs, there's virtually no shutter lag and it focuses in a split second (especially when using a USM lens). In continuous shooting mode with a fast memory card, it can take 10 RAWs or 27 JPEGs at 3 frames per second. RAW images are 10 MB each, so get a speed 2 GB or larger memory card, such as SanDisk's Ultra II series. Replacing both 1.8" LCD and info display is 2.5" high resolution LCD with LED backlighting. It displays current camera settings, photos in memory, and menu. Thanks to greater real estate and more refined user interface, XTi is very intuitive and pleasure to use. The minus is 10% lower battery life, which was merely adequate to begin with. XTi has 95% crop 0.8x optical viewfinder that displays 9 auto focus points, shutter speed, aperture, and more, but misses ISO speed, white balance, and metering mode. Overall, XTi's viewfinder is more than adequate but pales to Nikon D80's larger and more comprehensive one. Highlights of software package are ImageBrowser (Mac OS X Universal Binary), ZoomBrowser (Windows), and Digital Photo Professional (Mac OS X Universal Binary and Windows). ImageBrowser and ZoomBrowser are easy-to-weight lightweight applications for managing JPEG and RAW. Digital Photo Professional is considerably more powerful and lets you use XTi's dust delete data feature for removing dust its sensor cleaning hardware couldn't remove 
I've considered other, higher priced digital SLRs, such as the Nikon D80 and Canon 30D. However, I decided that I probably won't be using some of the more advanced features offered by those cameras, and would rather spend the money saved on a better lens. In terms of picture quality, all these SLRs are capable of equivalent quality. Currently I have 3 lenses, the kit 18-55mm, the 50mm f/1.8, and the 85mm f/1.8. I don't use the kit zoom lens anymore because I favor the faster, prime lenses. I mostly take pictures of my children, and the 85mm f/1.8 is an excellent portrait lens. It is sharp, fast, and produces beautiful background blur. Zoom lenses unfortunately are not as sharp or fast, unless you're willing to pay much more than the cost of the camera body. I think all novice SLR owners should buy the cheap Canon 50mm f/1.8, to discover what a fast lens can do when you set the aperture to 1.8, and take some portraits. You too can have professional-looking results 
I took pictures with this camera with artificial light, natural light, and when it was almost dark and all of my images came out sharp. I'm only using the cheap 18-55mm lens, which does not have image stabilization. As long as I use a tripod, or brace against something to hold the camera still, the images are perfect. I shot landscapes, portraits, animals, moving traffic, the sky, the moon, and everything I could think of and it all came out right. I was going to buy a 5D, but so far I'm satisfied with this camera and the price is way lower. Now I wonder what my pictures would be like with an IS lens... hmmmm : 
Well, I've had my Rebel Xti for about 6weeks now, and all i can say is wow!!! I did have the Rebel Xt, which was an awesome camera. I'm not a professional, but i do take pictures of what ever it may be outside or inside, youth or adult events as a hobby. This camera is not for the person who wants to just point and shoot or to have a camera to stuff in your pocket. This camera is for the creative person who wants control of the pictures they are taking. The sensor cleaner and wide LCD are just a few of the wonderful advances from the XT to the XTI. The camera for me is easy to use and takes great pictures in auto mode or in my mode. I hope this helps you in your decision whether to buy or not. 
I had this camera for about a week now. I bought an EF 28-105mm lens seperatly. I don't know why, but the auto focus did not work right away.It took some fiddling around before I was able to use the feature. I get gorgeous pictures with this camera. My one complaint is it feels small in the right hand. After 1/2 hour of shooting pictures my hand got a cramp. I have small hands and it still felt small to me. If you are considering this camera I'd go to a store see how it feels. I can't imaging being able to use it for a long time if you have a big hands. I'm still learning how to use it. But so far its meeting all my expectations. 
Amazing quality for an affordable price (still not cheap tho). This lens takes great quality photos and is my daytime/outdoor performer. Although I don't think the IS is equal to 1 f-stop when it comes to low light situations but it sure is very helpful at these high f-stop numbers 
I got this lens to complement my 10-22mm and 100-400mm lenses. It is a great general purpose lens (not too wide, not too narrow) for everyday walk around shooting. The image stabilization and constant aperture are nice features. It is also weather sealed so you don't have to worry about the elements as much as with most other lenses, of course you would need a weather sealed camera body to be completely safe, but it still makes me feel a little better in sandy or snowy conditions. I use this on the Rebel XT and Rebel XTi which are 1.6X crop bodies and make this closer to a 38-168mm which can be useful for portrait work, landscapes, large animals, or somewhat close macro. Of course there are lenses that do all of these things better, but to get this all in one package is really valuable. After all you are less likely to miss a shot if you have 1 versatile lens vs. 5 really great specialized lenses (not that you shouldn't get those too, but this is a good all around contender.) I have posted a few photo examples above to show the range of colors and versatility of this lens. It is not the sharpest lens I have, nor the fastest, but it is the one that is on my camera most often unless I am going out to shoot something specific. If you don't want to spend quite as much, the 28-135mm is also a very good lens 
I picked up a 5D in March with a 28-135. Worked with that for 3 months and felt something was missing. I went and bit the bullet, got the 24-105 and what an amazing difference it made. Color=vivid, clarity=sharp, good walk-around lens. After 4 months, I have not one bad thing to say about this lens. My suggestion, if you are looking for a lens, would be this one 
While this review is not as technical as others all I can say is the quality of the end result is well worth the money! I shot a wedding this past weekend 2 days after receiving this lens and am just going over some of the photos and all I can say is this piece of glass has given me the razor sharpness I've been looking for. I've been hesitant into jumping into the "L" lens arena but now that I'm here I could never go back! Don't settle for less! Your photography is worth it 
My first L lens and I'm sold. While I did spend a lot of time - a lot, this isn't a small purchase - on deciding between this and the 24-70/2.8, I feel I made the right decision. First, I took into account what I actually shot. Not what I thought about shooting or wanted to shoot, but what I really spent my time shooting. Then I backed that up by looking at the past six months' worth of photos. For me, this is the right choice. The big decision wasn't over image quality - rather it was the max aperture. 2.8 vs 4.0. The 4.0 with IS won. I absolutely LOVE the IS! Even at higher speeds, IS rocks. (It also eats batteries like a Hummer guzzles gas) OK, so shooting with it is a dream. Incredibly fast focus. Wonderful fit and finish. I could gush all night. If you're spending a lot of time trying to justify it, don't. If it won't break your bank, it's well worth it. If you're trying to decide which lens, try what I did. It made all the difference to me. What's the downside? I'm ordering a 17-40 today. The L lens bug has bitten. Next will have to be the 70-200/2.8. There goes the kids college fund. :- 
This is a great range for use as an every day walk around lens. It's very versatile, light and produces great image sharpness throughout the range. There is a bit of vignetting at the wide end, which I actually like. However, being f4, this lens is simply not fast enough for me. I shoot a lot of images where I want the out of focus areas (bokeh) to be glassy smooth (for weddings, portraits and such) and you cannot get that with this lens as good as you can with the 24-70 f2.8. The 24-105 f4 lens does have image stabilization which will help you to hand hold and get the shot in lower light situations, but there is not much that can be done to get super smooth bokeh with it. If you zoom all the way in, your DOF will be low and pretty darn smooth though in my case, I just prefer the look and bokeh of the 24-70 overall rather than this lens. Although the 24-70 is super heavy in weight compared to the 24-105. But I'm a professional photographer and so while my needs and likes are geared towards preferring the 24-70 f2.8, this doesn't mean the 24-105 isn't ideal for many if not most. 
I have both lenses, the 24-105 4 L IS and the 28-135 3.5-5.6 IS. I have a 20D, but my wife and I decided we each wanted a camera to ourselves so I bought the 24-105 lens along with the 30D about 2 months ago. I was so sure that I'd see a big difference with the L lens since my 70-200 2.8 IS L is such a superior lens. The thing is, I can't justify it. I've set the camera on a tripod and switched the lenses back and forth taking pictures with identical light and settings on a variety of subjects. (They both take extremely nice pictures) Maybe with a full frame sensor the difference would be apparent. At this point I like the extra reach of the 135mm. I'll let my wife use the $1200 L lens. My recommendation is: for the money on a cropped sensor camera I'd stick with the 28-135 lens 
While it isn't fashionable to use anything but a zoom lens anymore, this L series 135mm fixed focus lens is the "real deal". It is superbly sharp, and fast, and easy to use. I took it to Africa with me and was astounded with its brilliant clarity. Great for portraits... and for anything requiring a mid-length telephoto. Highly recommended 
Everyone gives this lens a rave so maybe i should approach this terrific lens from a shooting POV. Shooting wide open at f2at 135 gives your pictures a distinct quality you would never get from zooms, there isn't a zoom at this focal length that is this speed either. A few primes come close but they're nowhere near as sharp wide open. the af is fast and very accurate and the lens has a great feel on a 20d/5d/10d body even wo the battery grip of the cameras. Close up magnification of .19x to.21 therabouts is a nice bonus of this lens, letting you get closer wo being too in your face for tight headshots. I always felt that photographers usually have a sweet spot when shooting certain things like some portrait photographers like the distance the 85mm gives them when approaching a subject, turns out I'm liking the 135 focal length quite a bit for headshots and the 85 for torso and head shots. One thing I like about this 135/f2 combo is that there's enough DOF to get most of the main subject in view and focus but the background will still be blurred out. It's really great when you want the subject in focus and nothing else, as opposed to the 85 1.2 parts of the subject could melt into the background resulting in images that be a little too ethreal for some tastes. Couldn't you just stop down the 85? Sure but the relationship of the foreground to background would still be different with the 135. The 135 f2 can give a result that's juuust right. The backgrounds just a little more compressed with the foreground but the foreground is sharp but the background is gone. Almost like you lurred the background in photoshop. But you'll never get the same results from blurring in photoshop, for one thing the highlights would get muddied in a blur treatment in PS while the highlights stay clean at f2. Don't just use this thing for portraits, use it the way you would use a 50mm and try and frame as such, again the focal lenth and wide aperture will give an interesting result. I basically use it for candids and portraits during a wedding. Fantastic lens, very sharp, very handholdable, the focal length is terrific for portraits and the bokeh is very beautiful, equal in sharpness to the 85 1.2 or any of Canon's $5k lenses. This is probably the best lens you can get for the price, the only lens I've used with better saturation and contrast is the 35 1.4L. Downside: Not as handholdable as the 50,35 1.4 or the 85 1.2 during low light situations due to it's focal length 
If you don't want to get hooked on canon L series lens, do not buy this one. I made a mistake of buying one and now all I want are L canon lens. It is super sharp, contrast and saturation is fantastic. No need to retouch any of your photos. So far, I've used it on candid shots of my kids and dance gigs. f/2.0 helps a lot to get the right shutter speed to freeze action. A very good buy. I got mine here at Amazon 
Man. what a lens!!! It's not cheap, and I dont' find the 135mm to be a particularly useful focal length with my 20D but after seeing glowing reviews of this one both at [...], I decided to buy one and try it for myself. It's not cheap at $900, but it's worth every penny. This one is an absolute stunner. I cannot believe my eyes at the sharpness at f2 and it improves very little when stopped down. The bokeh is unbelievable!!! I dont' hesitate to shoot at f2 and I don't find it necessary to stop down just to increase sharpness. The size and build is perfect although I don't like Canon's hood design. Why can't they simply make the hood with the same crincked finish of the lens?? Then they would not so easily scratch. It's beyond me. But that's not a problem with the lens itself and whenever I use this lens, I know I have one of the best lenses ever designed. It forces me to excel myself knowing that now,the only limitation is me, the photographer and not the camera or the lens. An absolute beauty. Go try it yourself. I try to shoot with this as much as possible and the results are stunning. I just wish it came with weather proofing and Image Stablization like Canon's modern lenses but that's just nitpicking. I love it as it is 
This is my all time favorite lense. Eat your hearts out Nikon, Olympus Pentex, because this baby alone is reason enough to go with Canon. I cannot begin to tell you how sharp this "L" lense is. Words fail me. On second thought, no they don't. Use this lense and you'll wind up with photos shaper than an lightening blade, clearer than a ghost's eyes, crisper than a new dawn on an uncharted island. I shot the portrait on two book covers with this lense. Did the wedding photos for my best friend's wedding and every one turned out better than the ones they paid the wedding pro hundreds of dollars to do. I'm documenting the growth of my child with this lense and I've caught hundred's of my girl's smiles with it and yes, sometimes even a tear or two. You cannot go wrong with a Canon "L" lense. They are the tops, they really are. Jack Priest, Sailor Home from the Se 
I believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. Forget about zoom lenses even if they are L. This lens is far better than 70-200L in my opinion. It is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. With zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens. It is very well built but not excessive heavy, come with hood and bag, but unfortunately, Canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the L lenses. Combined with a Tamron 1.4X teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom L lenses at 189mm focal length. Yes I know I lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens. But I am really happy that I decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200IS to 135/2L+1.4X. This not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures, especially at wide open. Better portrait lenses, like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8, would cost several thousands of dollars. Trust me, once you play with primes, you will not like zoom anymore. I am also using a 24-70L to shoot my small kid. After using this lens, I don't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday, the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6X crop factor of digital camera. A 35mm/1.4L will become 56mm which is really not good. Order from Amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock. They shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated "in stock soon". Pros: Very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5. Very fast lens with f/2 Very good bokeh (background blurring). Overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color. Smaller size, less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s. It is a L lens: best build quality, fast/quiet ring USM AF with FTM. Cons: No hard case. No inexpensive. Effective focal length is 216mm on 10D/20D/Rebel/300D which is a little difficult to use for portrait 
This lens is the best in its class. I wish every lens I had was this sharp. This thing is top notch 
This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens. I got this filter for a friend of mine for his Nikon 18-70mm ED DX lens. 
I bought this to keep the dust of Iraq out of my Canon EF-S 17-85 lens. It does a fine job and I've seen no noticeable change in the quality of images that I'm capturing with my Canon 20D 
I bought this filter to put on the front of the 18-70 DX lens on my Nikon D50. It works well and protects the front element of the lens from dust, dirt, fingerprints and whatnot. It seems to cause a little vignetting (slightly darkened corners) at extreme wide angles (~18mm) -- but from what I've seen so far it isn't terribly noticeable, 'specially for the price 
I can't help but give the lens cap 5 stars, what can I say, it fits, it covers the lens and keeps the dust out. The bad part about purchasing from this place was paying as much in postage as for the cap itself but it was hard to find elsewhere. I also could not have it delivered here on Fort Wainwright Alaska because I'm only allowed a PO Box so I had to have it shipped to my home in New York and then had them send it on to me-go figger 
The Lowepro Case 4 is a great case for a long telephoto. It's well padded, well-built and protects the lens very well. However, I tried to use it with a small Lowepro Rezo 190 AW and found that (even using the SlipLock attachment) it completely unbalanced the bag. It was so uncomfortable and unpredictable, that I finally gave up and bought a Lowepro AW Magnum (where all the gear I use fits inside the bag) to replace both. I now just use the Case 4 for storage purposes or to bring the telephoto along in the car when I'm "hand-carrying". I believe it would work much better as an attachment on a medium size bag where another lens case could be hung on the other side of the bag to better balance the weight 
I recently purchased a used Canon 300mm f4 L and it didn't have a case. This lightweight case was perfect for this lens. It fits snugly, but not too tight. The case is lined with about 1/2" of high density foam. I'm pretty sure that this case would adequately protect a heavy L series lens in a 4-5 foot fall. The case can be used with my Tamarac MAS bag, but most of the time I sling the lens and case over my shoulder using the attached shoulder strap. This is a very secure, reasonably priced lens case that provides excellent protection for your valuable lenses. 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
I searched and researched the lens to purchase with my Canon Rebel XTI for weeks because I knew that I did not want the kit lens. I also did not have the money to spend on a 5, 6, or $700 dollar lens. In the end after reading countless reviews, ones implementing professional techniques and ones using just opinion, this lens looked to be the best value. For the money I really don't think that you can beat this lens. It focuses quickly, it is really quiet while doing it, and it is sharp enough for the money. Plus it has full time manual focus, which is a really big plus for a lens in this price range. The only problem is it is a little on the narrow side with the 1.6 crop factor on the Rebel XTI, but I would much rather have to deal with that than a sub-par image. In summary I would recommend this lens in place of the kit lens to anyone who doesn't have the money to buy an "L" series lens. It is really a great value 
I'm very happy with this lens. It offer's an ample variety of options, high image quality and it is light 
While this lens is a great improvement over the kit lenses the focus is often soft in raw modes and overal just not always tight. Color accuracy is very good, not perfect but very good. Of course color accuracy is more often a result of your paper (yes really - it is) than your lens after you get to a certain point. After using this lens for 2 months and shooting perhaps 20,000 shots with it I wished I had saved my money for the inevitable l series lens. If color accuracy is your main issue, be sure to look at your photo paper too. Hp, Kodak, and even low end papers from inkpress all do strang things to color and blur your images. Try someone like MOAB paper. You will be AMAZED at how much of a difference it will make in your color accuracy and detail. I just switched to Kokapelli from MOAB for commercial prints and am amazed by the results. As is usually the case focus is softest at f3.5 though it does produce a surprisingly decent bokeh 
I bought this lens to replace the kit lens on the Rebel XT. I find this lens to be a very good value, a very good value. I also have the canon 28-135 3.5 ... And find the 28-105 lens to be a very stong lens for the price. It might even be just a notch clearer then the 28-135 but at half the price. It's size is nice and light weight and fits nice on the Rebel since it is a smaller DSLR. All in all, a great lens at a budet price but it dosn't act like it. Fast focus, fair range, nice size, easy to lug around. I would sugest this lens to any one and first on my list to someone who is not wanting to go crazy on lenses and extras for their camera, and just want to simply get some nice pics without spending all their lunch money. Also the lens takes the same size filters as the kit lens, so if you have spent a few dollers on a few filters for the kit lens your in luck. I know I was happy to still use the 3 filters I've already got. 
This lens is truly a 'must have' if you don't have lots of cash to spend. Simply put, it is an excellent performer for the money. I recently got this lens for my Rebel XT, and noticed a HUGE improvement over the 18-55mm kit lens. Sharpness has improved considerably. The 18-55mm has some SERIOUS issues in that area. First of all, sharpness was REALLY bad at large apertures. But smaller apertures were not really much better. The 28-105mm still is not the best performer at large apertures. But it is MUCH better than the 18-55mm. However, at around f8 or higher, the 28-105mm is tack sharp. In addition, this lens does not suffer from the problem of having a clear foreground and soft background that my 18-55mm suffers from. Color accuracy has also GREATLY improved with the 28-105mm. Colors look MUCH more natural with this lens than with the 18-55mm lens. This is particularly true of lighter colors, especially when you go to increase saturation with Photoshop (or other software). Increasing saturation to improve the appearance of dark colors on a picture taken with the 18-55mm would typically make lighter colored objects look VERY unnatural. This sort of problem is MUCH reduced with the 28-105mm. I should also say that this lens appears to overexpose somewhat compared with the 18-55mm. This is more good than bad, however, as it has the effect of making the lens faster. Of course, this lens is not without its drawbacks. I mentioned the slight softness at large apertures, for instance. Also, it is not the fastest lens out there. But then again, what do you expect for the price? And finally, 28mm is not exactly wide angle on a cropped sensor digital SLR like the Rebels or the 20D. But despite these drawbacks, this lens really performs like a champ. And when used in its element (ie higher f-numbers), it works quite well. Also, since it is not an EF-S lens, it will not become a paperweight should you decide to upgrade to a 5D. 
THE BOTTOM LINE: I needed to replace the lens on my Canon Rebel XT D-SLR. The EF-S on first glance seemed like the perfect replacement since Canon produced the EF-S series specifically for the compressed sensor D-SLR line. After weighing the pros and cons of the two, I chose this EF lens largely on the basis of price. It was the right choice, and I haven't found any loss of features or quality. Multiplying the range by 1.6 for a 35mm equivalence (if you have a Rebel XT, 20D or 30D), this model is really just a slightly wide angle to stronger telephoto zoom. (about 45mm-170mm if it was a 35mm film camera) If this range suits you, then this lens is an excellent value over a EF-S wide-angle/telephoto zoom. You'll keep all of the features, save money and have a faster lens. The EF series meshes well with the current line of Canon digital SLRs. In addition, unlike the EF-S series, they are compatible with all of the Canon EOS products including higher-end cameras like the Mark II. SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS FROM WEEKS OF USE: My first concern before purchasing this lens was the MINIMUM FOCUS DISTANCE of 0.5 meters, or approximately 18 inches. I do a lot of macro work transferring images into digital, so I was a tad worried. However, after getting the lens and zooming in, I realized that the focusing distance wasn't really an issue after all. In most cases, I could manage to stand six or so inches further away and still get a highly magnified shot. So that you can see that the macro function works well, I've uploaded an image of a small hamster photographed at 102mm. (The aperature is pretty big -- after all, a hamster IS a moving target) My second concern was lens QUALITY AND SHARPNESS, particularly in the wide-angle setting near the edges of the photo. This lens exceeded my expectations. So that you can see the quality of this lens, I've uploaded an uncropped picture of the SF Bay Bridge taken at the 28mm wide-angle setting. You'll see that the photo is sharp all the way through the edges of the frame. (it is a web-sized jpeg, so you should take that into consideration and use it mainly to see the sharpness of the photo, particularly near the outside edges) I did get an unexpected bonus with this lens. The MANUAL FOCUS ring is in the front. I love it. Disabling the auto-focus is a snap, and the position and feel of the manual focus is perfect for sports or social activities where the subject is often not the closest object. The ring itself is ridged and made of rubber, making handling a breeze. While I hadn't expected to replace my stock lens so soon, I think it ended up for the best. This lens is actually superior to the one that came with the XT. I lost some wide-angle function but gained much more telephoto. The price is excellent and the quality of the lens is high. 
I was given this lens after my Sigma 28-135mm lens broke. While that lens has been fixed, I haven't used it since attatching the Canon lens on my camera. The Canon 28-105mm may have a smaller zoom range, but other than that is clearly a superior lens in every respect. It's sturdy, fast-focusing, sharp, and has good color. In short, it's what you hope to find when purchasing a consumer grade lens. There are other cheaper lenses on the market, like Sigma's lens or Canon's f/4-5.6, but this lens is worth the extra $100 for its reliability, sharpness and overall usability 
This timer/cable release has a lot of features. Works well. The cord is somewhat short though, and it is of cheap plastic construction. Hard to imaging that it costs this much. I think it's over priced. But it does the job. 
I've had my remote switch for almost 3 months now. I love it. So far the only feature I have used is the remote switch and it works flawlessly. If you want to trip the shutter from a distance without shaking the 20D (the camera I use) this is what you need. I use it with the extension cord since I am generally about 30 feet away from the camera. I am very pleased with this purchase. No complaints at this point 
I also received this remote with only the international warranty. I called Amazon and they immediately sent me out a replacement free of charge; Yeah. But alas, it too had the international warranty; @#$%!. I have returned both, unopened and unused on their dime. Perhaps this is the only version they have 
Well I too have recieved a "grey market" version of the product, with an international warranty only. As this has been mentioned before, and apparently has been rectified by Amazon, I hope I'll recieve the same treatment. But this still troubles me. Is Amazon continuing to sell off cheaper merchandise, only addressing the issue on an individual basis when people complain? What grey market means is that the product was originally intended for sale outside the US, but has been imported because that version of the product is cheaper than the version intended for US sale. While it's a legitimate enough process, they should be telling us if they do it, because the warranty has been invalidated by being sold outside the boundaries of the system Canon has put in place. I'm not even touching the hardware until I find out what's going on about it, so I can't rate its quality.. but I have no doubt that it's a quality piece of hardware, I've never heard anyone have anything bad to say about it, except its price, a gripe I totally agree with. Let's face it folks, if it wasn't a proprietary accessory to a high priced camera system, it should really cost about $20. It's just a simple programmable timer no more sophisticated than most wristwatches 
I have had this product for over two years and used it extensively in my travels. Yes it has shortfalls and "may" be considered expensive, but for the price it is better than some other "aftermarket" designs for other Camera makes. For amature timelapse and timed exposures it works quite well. As far as a remote for instant low light or exposure shots it is expensive, get the Canon RS-80N3 Shutter release The biggest complaints seems to be the limited number of shots [99] in certain modes and the shortness of the connecting cable length. Using the "continous" mode I have not failed to capture timelapse photos that filled my needs. The short connecting cable can be corrected by purchasing the Canon ET-1000N3 extension cable [33 ft]. Now that at $2.50+ a foot, is expensive! But in my persuit of remote control capability a must have. Battery life is fantastic, thousands of shots and still going strong. Of course like camera battery a spare is a blessing [and in this case cheap]. I think it is a good accessory, if you enjoy time lapse and have spent the money for one of the new EOS cam's then the price is comparable to your continuing outlay for your hobby. A "gadgeteers must".. Too each their own, that is what supports "Horse Races". Enjo 
I was somewhat surprised to receive my TC80N3 with only an Canon international warranty....did anyone else receive a grey market version of this remote control? I have ordered $1000s of Canon products from Amazon.com and always received a Canon USA warranty card with the items....not sure why this item didn't carry the USA warranty. I have sent several emails to Amazon.com regarding this matter. I'll update the review when I receive an answer that is satisfactory. PLEASE NOTE: Amazon is shipping a replacement remote! I'll amend again once the replacement is received. Control itself is a wonderful product but for this price I DID expect a Canon USA warranty card. Gar 
The ability to combine four different delay and interval modes makes this product able to accommodate almost any automatic-shooting situation. You can control the delay until the sequence starts, the delay between shots, the total shooting time, and the number of shots. That last one, however, is where the glaring flaw comes in: The controller is limited to 99 shots when you use the total-number-of-shots setting. In correspondence I've had with Canon, they have had no explanation for this asinine limitation. Even a modest CF card these days holds more than 99 shots, even in raw mode. For time lapse, 99 shots is woefully inadequate. You can work around this defect by simply letting your card fill up or by doing the math and using the total-duration setting. But sometimes you want to shoot multiple sequences on one card. If you know you want about 300 frames (for example), it's annoying to have to baby-sit the camera and stop it manually, or to do the math and figure out how many seconds total your sequence will take, convert that to minutes and seconds, and then dial that into another setting on the controller. And if you then decide to use a different interval, you get to re-do all that. Dumb, Canon. The fact is, this device shouldn't be necessary anyway. Every camera today should come with this functionality; it's technically trivial, since every one of these digital SLRs is a computer with plenty of on-board timers and logic for this task 
I enjoy the TC80N3.You may think it's costly,but the features are out standing.I think it was worth the buy.The only disappointment I have is there is no "on,off" power switch 
This remote is a handy tool to have. It's very basic use is as a shutter release. It's best to use a shutter release for when your camera in on a tripod in low light situations. Using the shutter release in this way helps to limit camera shake which improves your images. Other programmable features include a self timer, interval timer, long exposure, and exposure count. You are permitted to use any combination all or none of these settings making the possibilities virtually limitless. I have used to self timer so that I could both take the picture, and be in it. The self timer can be set for just shy of 100 hours if you wanted to. For time lapse, a combination of the interval timer which can be set for just shy of 100 hours and the exposure count which can be set for up to 99 shots should be set. The self timer can be used to delay the first shot if desired. The long exposure can also be set up to just shy of 100 hours. The settings can be entered at any time without worry of inadvertent alterations. Pressing the light button until the hold indicator is displayed will deactivate all but the light button or prevents the stop/start button from being deactivated once an operation has been started. The TC-80N3 is operated by one CR2032 battery. I've had my remote for over 2 years and the battery is still going strong. I'm not sure how long the battery is supposed to last, but there is an indicator in the display panel to let me know when the battery starts to get low. If the battery is fine, I don't see the indicator at all. There is a storage place on the back for your cameras RC socket cover if you have one. I use this with a Canon 20D so it is of no use to me. The plug connects to the camera simply by pressing the plug into the socket. To disconnect, pinch the plug on the side and pull out. For me, this item is a must have. I enjoy low light photography and I get plenty of use just for this reason. It's great to have the option available for other photographic opportunities. It is clear to me that this is a well thought out, quality product by Canon. PROS: Acts as a simple shutter release Programmable options include a self timer, interval timer, long exposure, and exposure count CONS: Cable only about 34 inche 
Ok to start off I've heard different opinions about camera sensor blowers..some say it works like magic some say it can make it worse. So I gambled and bought this Giotto blower. I didn't want to buy all the cleaning swabs, liquid ect and rub it off...seemed like a annoying project. So I gave this blower a try. I never had that much dust on my sensor but when made my aperture smaller f/22 to be exact and did a picture of the blue sky I noticed a few blobs or dust spots. I wanted them off...now heres where the blower comes in. I used it a total of 3 times and it removed 98% of the dust off my sensor..thats really really good in my book for a $9 device. Now I have like 2 tiny dust spots on my sensor and I can easily live with that..or I could try to use it a few more times to completely get it off... In the meantime I'm very happy with the dust I got off it. Buy this blower....its a no brainer. 
I had some dust spots on my lenses, and on the mirrors inside. I was afraid to use the brush or cloth kits, since they could easily scratch. One of my photography books suggested I use this exact air blower, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's a simple tool, but it emits a strong amount of air and I was able to clean everything off. Even works well for keyboards or other dusty spots 
It works great - and no touching the sensor with a brush. Great produc 
I was surprised at just how big this rubber blower is. For it's size, it doesn't blow much air out - maybe a little bit more than a rubber squeeze toy for dogs. Speaking of dog toys, this item squeaks everytime I squeeze the bulb. The bottom line is this item actually works and helps remove dust from your sensor. Because of that, it's a solid pick-up.. 
I was quite annoyed when I found my D70 had come out of the box with dust on the lens. The place I bought it would only send it away to Nikon for cleaning, but a friend with the same camera advised me to get a dust blower and showed me how I should be able to blow the dust off myself. the first blower I tried didn't have enough power and the dust remained. I had almost decided to take the camera to get it cleaned when I read a review that suggested this one. I took a chance, and after about 15 minutes of trying, checking, and trying again, I finally have a dust free sensor! this is the most valuable piece of equipment that I have purchased for my camera, and I recommend this to anyone with a similar problem 
I had originally bought another brand of blower to clean my digital camera, but after using it once I ended up introducing more dirt and/or rubber bits than I care to remember. Long story short I don't use that for my camera anymore and it took me a long time to get all of that crud out of my camera. But then I decided to give another brand a try since so many people seemed to be able to use blower bulbs without any problems. When I got my new blower my sensor was already fairly clean, but after using it it was a little cleaner. You will still sometimes have those stuck on particles (I use sterile pec pads and eclipse solution to get rid of those with pretty good results, but do this at your own risk since it voids most camera manufacturers warranties.) I also keep my blower in the original packaging to keep it as clean as possible, I guess I am a little gun shy after my first experience 
I have owned the Giottos Rocket Air Blaster for 2 weeks now and love it. I use it for blowing dust of everything: Camera lenses, computer screens and out of computer keyboards. It is made of a nice soft material that allows it to be stored flat and out of the way. Additionally, it creates sufficient pressure to force away most dust particles and of course requires no canned air, as it works as you pump it. I'll never by a can of forced air again 
I bought this gizmo to clear the CMOS detector in my digital SLR camera. It seemed like a good alternative to using a specialized, expensive sensor wipes, and it would not invalidate the camera's warranty. The results with my camera were good but not perfect. Many large particles of dust were blown off the detector. However, some medium-sized particles were merely pushed to the edges. Nonetheless, I really like having the air blaster just for my camera. Aside from my camera, I have used this on a number of other devices around my home and office. It works particularly well at clearing dust out of the vents in my laptop and underneath the keys on my laptop's keyboard. However, it works poorly in clearing out the dust and grime in my desktop keyboard. In summary, I would say that this is a good device for owners of digital SLR cameras, although it is not a perfect substitute for sensor wipes. For owners of electronic equipment in general, this is a clever device that works reasonably well at cleaning dust out of some places 
One of the problems with owning a digital camera is that you'll occasionally have to clean dust off of the image sensor. You can't use compressed air because it will freeze and destroy your sensor. You don't really want to blow either because the moisture in your breath will damage your sensor... and make you pass out. You need "dry", relatively-high pressure air and this is what the Rocket Air is outstanding for. Simple to use. 1-Remove your lens (on SLR), 2-put into cleaning mode, 3-hang the camera upside down (presumably, to allow dust to fall out), and 4-squeeze the Rocket Air thereby cleaning the camera. At this point, I swear by it. I'm constantly changing lenses and this helps remove spects and ghost images. It's a must have in your Camera Kit 
The best feature of this flash is the wireless E-TTL feature. With two 550ex's one will work as a master and one as a slave and with the ST-E2 both flashes can be off camera and fired E-TTL. The draw backs are: price, no manual control in slave mode for greater light control, and size (this thing is big). The plus side weighs out the negatives. It is a great flash 
I am very happy of having gotten this flash.. it works pretty well, and I like its performance 
I just bought a digital rebel about a month ago. Love the camera, my old 380EX speedlight integrates with the camera but just doesn't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the Rebel. This flash does the job for the Rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once I grab that item. Another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash, is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital Rebel lacks. When this flash is mounted on your digital rebel, you don't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash. The Rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550EX to focus the lens; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs. The flash has tons of features that most of us might never use, but as a advanced amateur I'm glad they're there so I can play with that if I should choose to try out some fancy stuff. The wireless slave capability is handy but you've got to have at least one more 420EX, 550EX or 580EX to use that. I like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head, it's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up/down---this should make the head sturdier than I've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts. This unit is a HONKER--really big, and, no lightweight either. Get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you. What's the difference between this and the 580EX? The 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes, for me anyway it wasn't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580. All of the newer EOS camera bodies are fully supported by this unit, it also works on older EOS bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that aren't there on older stuff. I like this flash it covers well, cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use. When you get yours don't lose that book, Canon doesn't seem to have them online anywhere I can find and I've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one 
This is an absolute do-everything flash, with master/slave operation, wireless control of multiple channels for slave flashes, A:B:C lighting ratio control (better than the ST-E2's mere A:B ratio), full manual or automatic operation, strobe effects at selectable Herz rates and power, and even a small panel that serves either to widen its flash coverage to 17mm or simply provide a catchlight in a model's eyes when using bounce flash. Range is excellent, battery life is very good and can be compounded with one of the battery packs. The light itself provides excellent color, and a red lamp near the base adds a much more accurate and less harsh focus assist lamp than most of Canon's cameras provide. If you have an SLR, you'll almost certainly want an external flash. You can provide fill flash to reduce shadows in subjects eyes etc. during harsh daylight shots, take the flash off the camera to eliminate nasty shadows, and avoid the shadows caused by larger lenses and onboard flashes. Minor quibbles: most DSLRs have crop ratios of 1.3x or 1.6x, but don't pass this information on to the 550EX, which wouldn't care anyway. This means the flash thinks you want greater coverage than you really need (i.e. it will give you a 50mm's angle of flash coverage, when you only need an 80mm's), so you waste a lot of flash power and don't get optimum recycling times. Also, the interface is a little non-intuitive. If you want a slave- or onboard-only flash and don't need all the extra features, the considerably cheaper 420EX is for you. That said, if you do want all the extra features, the 550EX is still not for you. You want the 580EX, slated for October 2004 release, which fixes the minor issues with the 550 
This is one fantastic flash. I had it on my Canon A2e for four years, and was ambivilent, but if you match this lens with one of Canon's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550EX's features, you have an awesome, powerful, flexable flash that can change the way you shoot 
Top of the line. Works as advertised. TTL, E-TTL. 4 double AA batteries. Tilt, Rotate head, soft lens built in. Can control slave flash 
I got this camera back in May and lost it (but this camera seemed to be the best). I ordered the same camera from Amazon but had to return it because one of the pixels were blown. I got my replacement but the amount of time it takes to take a picture is an eternity. Look for some other camera. If people are posing you better hope you get it on the 1st shot, because if you don't it takes too long to take another. 
Easy to use, including zoom and uploading to computer. Nice clear photos when printed out 
Im a graphic design student in college, so i really needed a camera. I decided on this one and i am really glad i did. The pictures are nice and clean. The camera itslef is a very sleek looking one and is very compact. The only downfall to this is that it eats batteries pretty quick, but i just took them out when i wasnt using them. Buy this camera 
This camera is the first digital for me, and the only camera I have ever enjoyed having. The macro setting gives amazing closeups of bugs, flowers, etc. With the purchase of a charger and some batteries, I've kept it going for almost nothing. Better get a big memory card, too. The silly settings like "color swap" and "fireworks" are fun to play with. My only complaint is it is slow to recover between shots, so you miss some action of kids, etc. For the price, it can't be beat. gramma t 
The camera is the perfect solution for someone who does not want exchangable lensesand some items for more professional results. Combined with a direct photo printer it is easy and fun with plenty of photo options on the dial. My only problem is that I did not receive with the camera the software to alllow me to download to the computer from the from the Memory chip itself. Is there any way to get this software 
After hearing that Consumer Reports gave the Canon A520 a BEST BUY rating, I decided this must be a good family of cameras. It has been a joy to own and use. Easy to take pictures, easy to work and yes, it takes great pictures. It has more bells on it than I will ever use. I have been very satisfied with 4 and 5 MP cameras and have not wanted to spend a fortune for more. I just need to take pictures, review them and easily download to my computer. This does that and much, much more 
Very quick delivery. Product was exactly as advertised. Very happy with the whole process and the product 
...in that it diffuses the light energy of the flash in different directions, essentially turning the flash into a point light source. The light going off in different directions then bounces off nearby objects to fill in the shadow areas on the subject, making for a more pleasing softer look, especially on people. Note of caution: because this device diffuses the light from the flash, it takes much more energy per flash. Using the Stofen will drain your battery much quicker (about 4X in my experience) and it takes the flash much longer to fully charge after each shot, say 8-10 seconds vs 2-3s. Always keep a spare set of flash batteries with you. Another note...because it requires bouncing light of nearby objects to be effective, using this outdoors is not recommended. You're better off removing the omni-bounce and aiming the flash directly at the subject (and living with the harsh lighting). 
I got this as much for safety as anything. If I should drop my lens, a solid lens hood will help. Plastic construction will absorb some of the impact without transmitting all of it, as a metal hood would. Hopefully it will eliminate occurances of flair, although with the Canon 50mm f1.4 lens, that's not a big issue to begin with. It also can keep dust and debris off the lens surface if you're shooting in a less-than-ideal environment. It twists on and off the lens easily. When it's on, it's very snug and secure. Kind of pricy for a piece of plastic, but Canon's in business to make money. 
I never take my UV filter off of my lens unless I am going to immediately put on a different filter. There are basically two camps out there, those that feel you should always use a UV filter to protect your lens from dirt and scratches and those that feel it is a waste of time and only degrades your image. Well, I tried going without one for awhile and then dirt started to build up on the front element of my very expense lens. And although you can clean the front element of a lens, I feel much, much safer wiping my comparatively cheap UV filter time and time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage. I think for the nearly unquantifiable loss in image quality you may suffer by having a UV filter on, it is well worth the extra piece of mind it gives me 
I bought this camera 12/2005 for Christmas on the recommendation of Wolf Camera. I am not a photographer or techno advanced; just a mom with 4 kids. I love this camera. It's great and hasn't failed me yet. The salesman told me about the oversaturation and I adjusted it. The battery life is amazing as I am always on the go. It is so small I just throw it in my purse. I have not had any problems with the lens sticking or turning on unless I turn it on. Sounds like some of the other reviewers should go with a digital SLR. This is an awesome point and shoot camera and I would recommend it to anyone 
This isn't a full review but some thoughts I've had after using it for a long time. Stabilization- The fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you, you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash. If flash doesn't bother you, no sweat. But I've never like the look of it. Ease-of-use- Great. Voice memo- I use this feature all the time. It would be nice if it had a pause button because without it I end up with many small files. Ex- This is where you set the exposure. Casio does a great job putting everything in one place. The only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection (e.g. ISO 200 to 400) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot. Instead nothing happens. You have to click set first. It's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time 
The EXZ750 is simply a fantastic compact camera. It takes great pictures, even greater if you bother to use one of the many picture presets (scenery, portrait, macro, etc.). The pros: - picture quality is great; if you want anything better you'll probably be lugging around a DSLR - picture presets are extremely easy to use, even if you are not a techie and / or you've never handled a camera in your life (is there such a person?). - it will fit into your pocket and you'll forget it is there. This is a major advantage as the best camera is the camera you actually have with you - this one you will. - common settings (picture size, ISO, etc.) are one or two clicks away - very convenient The cons: - the camera does take videos (at more than decent resolution) but they come out shaky even if you have pretty steady hands. Without some image stabilization in it, it is definitely not a replacement for a video camera - although the camera has ISO settings of 200 and 400 you should probably avoid them due to noise Overall, a very positive and pleasing experience. Even having a digital SLR, I'm never giving this little puppy up 
Very small size (fits in my baggy jean pocket), fast startup, fast response when shooting picture. Much easier to carry around than my Canon G3. Does not do well indoors when flash is needed. Lots of red eye, much more than my Canon G3 
I spent a weekend researching digital cameras, exhausting and confusing, so many to choose from, and when I was in a store looking at various cameras, a customer just started telling me how much he loved this camera he had just bought, which was this one; I assumed it was 'a sign'. And it was. Small size is fantastic, put in your shirt pocket or purse, almost weightless. Quick shutter takes the best pictures of new baby grandchild of any camera anyone in the family has used. (others had Sony and Canon digital cameras) The movies are excellent. The quality and color of images are perfect, not too over-digitized as some have said. Everyone in the family thinks I'm a wonderful photographer, but it's not me, it's this camera. The battery life is really long, and it can take good pictures in multiple types of poor visibility situations. In the first month, I dropped it a few times, once on the sidewalk and it survived which was impressive. Having a viewfinder is a big advantage in bright sunlight. After using and loving it for 9 months, the telephoto froze. I sent it back to Casio, and they fixed it; it took 3-4 weeks, which is a little long, but did not charge me for the repair. The baby pictures are fantastic, especially because it takes the picture so fast, and the scenery pics all look like National Geographic. 
A good quality filter set at a great price. I was so happy with it I purchased sets for all my lenses and cameras! The same filters in my local camera store is more than double in price 
This lens is my favorite as I keep it on my Rebel XT at all times. I enjoy taking macro close-ups and portrait-type shots, which makes this a great lens for everyday use. It is light-weight and not bulky. My last SLR camera (years ago) was a Minolta with 50mm f/1.8 lens, and various other lenses that I rarely used. I usually don't use a zoom lens due to the extra length and weight. Also, most non-professional zoom lenses are much slower at the closest tele-position due to the higher f/stop. With a fixed focal length of 60mm, I don't mind moving myself toward or away from the subject (not a big deal). The pictures always appear to be sharp with good contrast and color saturation. My opinion on this lens is: "buy it ... you'll like it". I did ... and I love it. Good Luck 
the optics are the best i've ever seen. the clarity is great. the abillity to focus on small objects only 2" away allows great macro pictures. however the auto focus is much slower than most canon lenses, but i can focus manually. this is my favotite lens ever 
This lens is top notch. The quality of the photographs is the best I have ever experienced with a camera. 
If you would like a list of sites with reviews email gumby at dontquotemeonthat dot com Pros: Very sharp, bright (fast), versatile, excellent build quality. Cons: AF tends to be dicy in low-light conditions. Pros: SHARP, SHARP, SHARP. No distortion, no CA, optically superb and better Cons: EF-S mount. Had to sell it when I upgraded to the 5D. Pros: Very solid build, Internal focusing is fantastic, Produces wonderfully saturated photos and high in contrast, Bokeh is lovely and very smooth, Auto Focus is typical ring-USM with Full Time Manual focus being excellent and smooth. f2.8 Aperture, 52mm Filter Size Cons: I do feel Canon could reduce the price, however for this quality I don't mind paying for it. if your a newbie here's some info A lens is "fast" when it has a low f-stop... ok so when you have a smaller number the apature is bigger which allows more light through, so this means you can up the shutter speed. and still have enough light reach the sensor. ok so lets say you have an out door shot if you have say an f/4 lens the shutter speed could be 1/250 of a second and you would get a good exposer. Now this lens can only go f/4 but if you in the same outdoor setting, had an f/2.8 lens you could jump to 1/500 of a second and get the same exposer. and freeze the action mmore effectivly, this i believe is why it's a "fast" lens. ok have fun and get it done 
4 starts because otherwise 5 stars is inevitable: 1) Slow autofocus (hunt at times) but is to be expected of a macro lens. 2) built quality not as solid as expected at this price range. I bought this lens instead for two purpose: Macro and Portrait! I was thinking of buying the 100mm macro plus 85mm f1.8 but this lens saves me buying two lenses! I have been very happy with it as what it is. I don't do flying insects very much so it is not a problem but that said I was able to get 1:1 shot of a fly, see sample here: http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_54.html There are other samples in this gallery here: http://www.theteh.com/html/my_3rd_350d_xt.html The large aperture (F2.8) means that one could have shallow DOF and great for low light such as this pic: http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_49.html For portrait, I accidentally took this photo during the London Bombing of a women 'Shocked' by the incident unfolding in the public TV display. It was a coincident that her background inmage was the winning Reuter's photo of Tsunami tragedy and the matching colour of their dresses! I was quite far away so was able to capture her from head to toe: http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_25.html This illustrate the capability of both macro and normal photography using this lens. You will not regret it unless your primary aim is to shoot flying insets where longer 100mm or 150mm macro lenses may be needed in this case. 
I only wish that I had bought this lens earlier so I could have been using it longer. I am especially pleased with the short minimum focus distance - about 3 inches. This allows you to get very close to a small subject and to still fill the frame with the subject. I have had no problems with this lens and I love it 
The new Canon EF-S 60mm f2.8 Macro USM Digital SLR lens is designed to cover the entire field of the digital imaging sensors in Canon's digital SLR line, most notably the Canon EOS 20D. This corresponds in film to a normal lens perspective of approximately a 50mm lens. Furthermore it benefits from having Canon's USM autofocusing technology, allowing the photograher to have rapid, almost silent, autofocus, which is important when working in the field (You don't want to distract the animal you are photographing with the sound of the lens being focused.). Although this lens is not a L Series lens, the quality of its construction comes close to Canon's premium L Series professional line of lenses. Indeed, I have read elsewhere an excellent test report (I believe at Erwin Puts's website) on this lens praising its optical performance. Any Canon user of digital SLRs such as the EOS 20D who is interested in macro photography will regard this lens as absolutely essential for making great macro images 
This lens is well worth the price. The first thing you will notice is the quality when you handle the lens. It has a very solid construction. But once you mount the lens is where it REALLY shines. The clarity of focus is the best I've seen and the focus is super fast. The macro functionality is just awesome. I highly recommend this lens 
This battery works in my Canon SD550 interchangeably with the Canon NB3L that came with it. I get about as many shots on either one. 
I have a Canon SD-550. This battery is works perfect with it. I've noticed no difference in charge time and usage when compare with the original manufacterer one. Except the price is a lot lower 
What can I say? It fits in place of the overpriced Canon NB3L battery for my SD500 and lasts longer than the OEM battery. The quality of the battery on the external is very good. No sloppy glued edges or ill-fitting parts. The battery works very well in the camera and lasts longer by one hundred or so shots. I use a gig card so I tend to shot alot at once. Even with the flash the battery life is comparable to the Canon or even longer. I bought two instead of a single Canon battery and I have not been dissappointed 
I bought this battery as an extra battery for my camera. It is a lot lower in price than the Canon battery. I have not used either my original or this extra battery enough to fully compare them, but they seem to work equally well so far 
The product was great! You should get it. Usually, I'm skeptical abour getting generic brands, but this works perfectly 
I purchased my 300D in May 2005, when the XT was released and this 6.3 MP model's price began falling. I'd have to really pick this camera apart to tell you the downsides of it; disregard reviews by those who think this camera is not up to par -- of course it's not comparable to the EOS 1-Series or a 5D, so don't expect the same features or capabilities. The right user, however, can get similar results. That said, unless you are a professional photographer, I cannot imagine how the Digital Rebel could be inadequate for any amateur or semi-pro shooter. It's speed and megapixels have since been passed by, but it's still, especially now, a great buy. The kit lens will perform for you just fine, although most of my shots with the kit lens are at 18mm, landscape or just wide-angle shots. The flash works very well in most situations, even in extremely dark rooms. One guy complained his AF hunted in low light situations, even with flash...of course, what do you expect in a dark room? Use manual focus and grow up. Quality is great from ISO 100-400, although 800 can be somewhat ugly at times, and 1600 is basically unusable, especially if you're not shooting at f/2.8 or bigger. My main complaints: slow start-up time compared to the newer models (XT, 20D, etc) ... camera seems to be out of breath after continuous shooting; take 8 shots quickly and you may notice the camera needs to process info before it can shoot again. 2.5 frames/second is not very fast if you're shooting any sports. Overall, this camera has been incredibly reliable for me; it's gotten me front page shots on newspapers, magazine covers, calendars and websites. I used it so much that I blew out the shutter in 10 months; Canon fixed it at no charge and it works fine since. One minor problem: very rarely, it won't turn on unless I remove the battery and re-insert it. I've found the battery life to be fantastic. I can use it all day, even with flash, and still have some life at the end of the day. A backup battery in your bag should give you more than enough insurance for a day. I've printed at 11x17 with excellent results. With some practice, it's very easy to navigate. Menus and options are simple; changing the ISO or aperture is very easy despite what some have complained about. It's very reliable in fully-auto mode as well, especially if you're shooting with flash. A memory card reader is a must when uploading images. Overall: it's old news in the world of digital SLRs, but right now, a new or used model at such a good price is really is great value 
For its time and price (at the time), a fantastic camera. 6.3 MP is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro (non-studio) work, and this camera works very well with what really matters: Canon's fantastic lenses. Battery life on this camera is very good. The "shutter lag" (between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo) is fairly well non-existent, and the only real lag I have is when I am shooting multiple photos in RAW format. As most photographers know, the lens is almost more important than the body, and outside of Leica lenses, I don't think anything really competes with Canon's line. The 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...I used it at the beach, and on hikes with my dog, when I don't want to lug around my bigger, more expensive, higher-quality lenses. But for $75 or so, you can have a 50mm 1.8 EOS lens, which will supplement the 18-55 nicely, particularly for night photography. My one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings. When I shoot RAW this isn't such a big problem, because I can fix it in Photoshop, but most everything I shoot inside, unless I manually mess with the white balance every time, has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots, and then is annoying after. I think the more advanced EOS models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem, and also help a bit with the lag between the RAW shots...but for the money, this camera is excellent, and far, far superior to, for example, Olympus' digital exquivalent (for a similar price). The difference, as far as I'm concerned, is in the absolute advantage Canon has in lens quality. You can use a high-end consumer body like this one, use a professional piece of Canon glass (lens) and take excellent photos. I wouldn't invest in a system that doesn't also boast excellent lens quality 
I have had this camera a little over a year and I still can't put it down. It is wonderful. I have two little boys on the move and this camera takes their picture with hardly any delay. Just snap and go. I bought my dad the XP in March and he loves it too. 
An incredible piece of equipment at an almost give away price. I have no complaints and this camera surpasses what I expected 
I had an Olympus 5MP point-n-shoot Camedia camera I was pretty happy with for portraits. I was annoyed w/ the fixed lens that prevented me from taking good photos of wildlife. I have hummingbird feeders in my backyard and unless you've had the opportunity to work with hummingbird families for years, the sweet, tiny animals are skittish and don't often pose for you when you get too close. When my point-n-shoot stopped focusing, I took advantage of this situation by rationalizing this bigger purchase. What a joy it has been to use this camera. The 6.3MP is a significant improvement over 5 and the ability to take photos in manual mode cannot be understated. With the fixed point-n-shoot, the camera refused to shoot if it didn't "feel" that it was in focus... so it was impossible to shoot sunsets, lightning or other natural beauties in the "infinity" range of the focal length. The Rebel makes use of Compact Flash - the oldest, yet still the best technology for taking fast, high-quality photos in digital cameras. My less than perfect rating is due to the small memory buffer. You can take up to 3fps very easily, but if you click-click-click the shutter, it doesn't matter if Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster and Elvis start doing a little soft-shoe right in front of you, by the time the Rebel finishes writing the recent 3 quick shots to the CF card, the shot of the century has already slithered back into the swamp by the time the camera is ready to be used again. If you're taking portraits, not a problem. A click here and there and you'll never notice the lack of memory buffer... but if you're shooting at a ball game or other quick moving objects, you're going to get frustrated very quickly. The flash is decent, but you really need a good flash like the 580 in the hot-shoe if you want a better even spread and avoidance of red-eye. A lot of folks shrug about red-eye since most affordable or free programs like iPhoto or Photoshop Elements have built-in correction for red-eye - but red-eye correction by one click is only available for humans. If you're shooting wildlife, forget about any software that has a one-click (or a million clicks!) solution for blue-eye in dogs, yellow-eye in cats, flaming-demon eye in bunnies or the variety of odd reflections you will get bouncing off retinas of various species. The best way to circumvent this problem is to avoid bouncing flash directly into the retinas of your subjects from the get-go. No more glare or odd reflections when you use a better flash. The ability to upgrade to better lenses is the crux of SLR ownership. The sky is the limit. Get a good wide-angle and a good, fast telephoto and you've got yourself set for some great shots. This camera isn't going to take advantage of CF cards faster than 40x, so you can save money by buying the slightly slower CF cards, but I invested in the 80x cards so I can use them when I upgrade cameras. This Rebel has gotten me back into photography after a decade-long hiatus. The camera automatically detects vertical shots and turns them 90 degrees for you in the LCD window. It is quick and easy to adjust the ISO to "push" the film (so to speak) to take advantage of low-light situations, but you get the same grainy effects as you do when you push real film. With an ISO of 100 and using a 512MB CF card, you have 157 photos at your disposal - if you push it all the way to 1600, 104 shots on the same card. At 400, your shots are already compromized regarding print quality... but if Sasquatch comes-a-knockin' in the wee hours, you'll still get decent proof if you shoot at 1600. Having a background in film photography spanning 2 decades, I didn't even have to consult the manual for this camera to use it fresh out of the box. It handles in many ways like a professional film SLR, and unlike the point-n-shoots, there aren't cryptic settings that have no film parallel. For sunny days and outdoor shots, this camera is a sheer joy to use 
I have owned a Canon EOS Digital Rebel 6.3mp for several weeks now and love it. Fantastic pictures features. I worked with SLR's for many years. Figured it was time to "move up" to the digital SLR and glad I did. This camera has plenty of features available, or you can just set it for "auto" and that works fine, too. Though an optional flash is not needed for most photography I wanted one for far shots and such. Canon makes several models dedicated to this camera, but I find them weak (220EX) or costly. Shop carefully in trying to find a compatible flash. It needs to be "dedicated" to the digital Rebels. One that will work with AF (auto focus) or the SLR (film) Rebel may not work right. I also received conflicting information from Ritz Camera, both on-line and in the stores. Bottom line, if you need a flash, shop carefully and ask all the right questions. Personally I have held off buying one hoping more models at a lower price come out. The camera does already have a small pop-up flash. BTW, the Tamron AF 70-300 Macro 1:2 zoom is a nice lens to buy with it, and priced nicely at Beach Camera 
This review will be really two parts: one for the amateur who has been using point and shoots, or has experience with film based SLRs; the other one for the prosumer or advanced amateur who is either going to digital from film Canon EOS bodies or is getting into pro-level digital shooting on the low end. For the former, the camera is pretty much all you need; for the latter, it is lacking key functionality, but IS workable. I'm in the latter category. I've done freelance photo work in the past, but not since the digital age began to take off in the late '90s. I've been shooting EOS cameras since the early '90s, and added medium format in the late '90s for wedding and portrait work. I'll be honest: I didn't like the idea of digital at first. Sure, the workflow improvements over film sounded great, but I wasn't seeing the quality of digital vs. film. I still am very much a believer that, at least for prints, especially big prints, film delivers a better overall picture quality. But the quality of digital SLRs since the release of the Digital Rebel is so good, the workflow advantages trump film in all but rare situations. I'll still use my medium format equipment for landscape and outdoor pics I'll print large and frame, but other than a pocket 35mm, I can't see using film much at all in that category, after seeing what I can do with the DReb. If you are primarily an amateur who is either used to using a Point and Shoot (film or digital) or who has used a consumer film SLR, you'll find this camera easy to operate and use to the extent you used your other cameras. I bought this without the lens, as I have other lenses and the packaged one didn't offer me anything, but for those without Canon glass, you get a surprisingly good lens with the kit. Remember, though, that the lens will only fit on the Digital Rebel, its successors, and possibly the 10/20D line of Canon EOS bodies. Shooting is pretty simple. Charge the battery, which is easy -- the charger blinks depending upon its charge. You can look at the charger with the battery on there and see where you are, charge wise. It doesn't take very long to charge the battery fully. Once you have the battery in the camera, you'll need a Compact Flash card. I recommend SanDisk Ultra II cards. You won't experience any write time problems over an above this camera's natural limitations. Then, set the ISO value (100-1600), set either the pre-programed mode on one side of the dial, or the traditional Program/Shutter Priority/Apeture Priority settings on the other side, and you are ready to rock. Remember that unlike many digital cameras, the LED on the back of the camers DOES NOT function as a viewfinder. Aside from displaying various camera options, it shows what you shot after shooting. If you want to use this as an advanced amateur/pro setup, you can, but know its limitations. I bought this in March and have been shooting all sports with it. I'm using a Canon L USM lens, and have gotten some terrific shots. But I've also missed some that have led me to decide to sell this camera and pick up a 20D. The problem I get into is focusing speed and zones. The 2.5 fps with only a 4 frame burst isn't as big a problem as it sounds. I can still get good action in the burst mode, but admittedly 5 fps with 22 or 25 (20D) bursts is much better. If you want to use this to shoot something like concerts or indoor events, you won't have the same focusing issues. You will have to deal with any flash limitations, but for that information, you will have to read another review. I'm not a camera flash guy under any definition. The only real problem I've had with this camera is that my shots are consistently underexposed by about .5-.7 of a stop. I shoot exclusively RAW mode (never shot JPG on this one other than first dozen or so shots) and it has been correctable when I convert the images. This is more of a minor irritation, and may not be noticable in JPEG shots. I've seen others using this camera complain of it as well. This camera is as good of a consumer camera as you will find. If a pro, or semi-pro, can make something function for his or her needs, you know the consumer can get everything they need out of this. I've been shooting since I was 8 or so, have owned umpteen cameras, and this one fills its market niche as good as any of them 
There are already tons of reviews on the EOS 300d (Digital Rebel) but I do want to share my experience with the camera, so I will keep this short. I bought this camera about 5 months ago and I am in love with. I was not new to photography or to SLR's, but new to the world of digital SLR. I had previously used an ancient Minolta x-570, a "pro-sumer" 35mm film slr with a Vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens. First and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures, very high quality and no distortion that I have seen. This camera is particularly good as a beginner's dSLR because there are so many options to use and learn. But until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues, you can use this just like a point and shoot. Battery life has been excellent so far: thought I would suggest getting an extra to have as a backup for long days of taking photos. I have also been quite happy with the kit lens, which I wasn't sure I would like since it is not as versatile as the lens I had been using on my Minolta. But the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool: I have been able to take some great shots, while also learning what kinds of other, better lenses I would like to add to my setup.  **The only issue I have had was a problem with a Sandisk 2gb CF card. After about 300 shots, the camera froze and stopped responding to that card. I was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact, but don't risk it. If you're serious enough to spend this kind of money on a camera, spend a little extra money on the Sandisk Ultra II line of high-speed cards. 
Manufactured of a soft gray felt like material, a tough leather bottom, and draw string closure at the top, this lens pouch helps protect your lens from dust and the elements. I store my lenses in a camera bag, and these cases fit nicely around the lens taking up little precious space. This case is meant for use with the Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM, EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM, EF 24-105mm f/4.0L USM, EF 28-70 F/2.8 L, EF 50 F/1.0 L USM, EF 85mm f/1.2L USM lenses. These L lenses normally come with the case when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. However if your case is worn, replacing it to protect your lens is recommended. PROS: Protects your glass investment CONS: I cannot think of an 
I purchased a D-30 from Amazon last year and I previously had been using a Digital Nikon. The improvement was monumental in all aspects. I subsequently drowned my camera, and I am getting ready to repurchase another D30. They are not ready for water yet? I have taken approximately 5000 pictures and saved them all in the most usable format and I will continue to do the same. The Photoshop software that comes with the camera is very user friendly, I am sure there are many features yet to learn, but I have been extremely happy with what I have already used. I hesitate to say mastered 
I've owned one of these cameras for about four years now, and I have been very pleased with it. It is light, small and easy to carry. It takes beautiful pictures--very sharp, and with good colors. The pictures look good even when you blow them up so big you can see the individual pixels. It was actually my second camera like this. The first had a problem with the USB port on the side of the camera, and I took it back to the store and traded it for a new one. This camera also had a problem too, after about two years, the button on the back that is needed for making settings stopped working properly. But still, considering the cost of the camera and the quality of the pictures, I will be buying another one. It's worth it. 
This camera is great for photographing artwork. It's the only camera I could find that doesn't bow the edges of paintings or watercolors (I think a lot of cameras have a lens that distors things, but you can't tell until you photograph something that is supposed to be rectangular). The color reproduction is also good. If you want a camera that takes good pictures of distant objects, or one with higher than 2mp resolution, look for another camera. 
This camera is designed to be an entry-level snapshot camera and it is very good at being just that. It takes decent photos and is very easy to use. As other reviewers have indicated, it does tend to chew through the batteries, but I just buy AAs cheap at Sam's and don't worry about it. It works especially well in outdoor situtions. It performs less well in low light. Due to this limitation, it is just about useless as a webcam. Even with all the lights on in the room, the webcam image is almost totally black. The flash and the lens are less than an inch apart, so this camera is very prone to redeye. There is a redeye reduction mode to the flash that works okay, but doesn't totally fix the problem. All-in-all, for an entry-level camera, the A200 is quite usable. Just be aware of what it is and don't expect it to do more. 
I had and tried several digit-cams and can say that you cannot find a better camera for this price. Pros: + Great value, low price + Easy handling + Portability, light weight + Great Fuji colours, good auto white balance + Fast shutter response, close to film cameras + Control over exposure, flash and pre-programmed white balance + It uses AA's, great battery life + Changig between images in playback mode doesn't take hours + Excellent prints from the photos Cons: - Images noisier than competition (but they are more expensive also) - Images too much compressed, therefore less detail, no control over jpeg compression (but this is the same with most Fuji models unfortunately) - No control over ISO - Low resolution LCD, too dark in low-light - No optical zoom (but at this price it's ok) - The camera has a cheap feel to it (but again, at this price it's ok) - Weak flash for outdoor night shots, but enough for smaller room shots - Flash recharge time takes a few seconds, camera freezes (but this is the same with most Fuji models unfortunately) - It uses expensive XD-cards - Sluggish zooming and panning in playback mode - No sound in video I highly recommend this camera for beginners or to those who doesn't want to spend more on a digital camera. I've read many negative reviews due to it's bad photo indoors. Okay, it's not a Canon G3. At first I thought the same, but then set the controls to manual, set the exposure up to the highest value and then shot the picture. The end result was much better than in full auto mode. So my advice is indoors and in low-light set the exposure manually, you'll be glad you did I promise. The colours are well balanced, and the prints come out great, no matter how noisy the images are, you won't notice that on the photo paper. This model is now out of sale, but if you can find a second-hand one at a good price don't be afraid to buy it, it's an excellent buy 
I got this camera for my 17th birthday last summer, and it's great. As much as I'd love to have a Canon Powershot, it's a bit out of my price range. All the people who think that using the LCD screen runs out the batteries after 2-4 pictures are lying to you. I bought rechargable batteries from radioshack, and I've taken up to 400 picture without the batteries needing to be changed. This is a good camera with good quality in good lighting. In dark or overcast situations, it can look a bit grainy, but that's easily photoshopped. I recommend that when uploading, plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter, because uploading sucks all battery power right out. I recommend this for someone who hasn't owned a digital camera before, or for someone that wants good quality at a not-so-crazy price 
This is a very nice starter camera that is easy to use. The batteries run out kind of fast, but once I bought rechargeable batteries it solved that problem! Surprising good quality for the small amount of money I paid for it 
I sold my Nikon stuff for Canon, I was using the Sigma 70-200 f/2.8 which was very nice. When I moved to canon I was going to get the Sigma lens again (shooting soccer) I wasn't having any luck finding a used one reasonably priced. I researched the Canon 200mm f/2.8 and decided to try it. I couldn't be happier. The AF is faster and more accurate. It is very easily hand held(I usually put the Sigma on a monopod) I love this lens 
There is nothing like a telephoto to bring boats at anchor up close when you're halfway up a mountain. I got a great shot in Tahiti just that way with just this lense and a friend of mine used it on the cover of her romance novel. It's true the lense is heavy. Canon says it weighs 1.7 pounds, but it seems heavier. No matter though, because you won't have to go to the gym if you heft this baby around for awhile, and as a side benifit, you'll get crisper, sharper photos then you would with any other 200mm out there today. Just think of it as body building and photo shooting both at the same time. Also this one won't break your wallet. Serously, this is one darned fine piece of glass, you just simply cannot go wrong with a Canon "L" lense, just can't Jack Priest, Sailor Home from the Se 
Canon L lenses are known for their great optics and priceyness. This fast tele is an excellent value. The only thing that would improve this lens would be the addition of the image stabilizion feature found on a few Canon optics. Of course, the advantage of large aperature lenses is that you can set a fast shutter speed and still have enough light for a shot. This lens is surprisingly compact, (as long focal length teles go). The autofocus is very fast and quiet. Comes with a hood, too.  
I got this lens with my 300D (Digital Rebel) kit and have enjoyed it ever since. Solid, durable, reliable, good in most light situations. Lots of success in wide-angle landscape photos. I'm typically using this at the 18mm end and it's produced beautiful images, especially at sunset and indoors with flash. Also very light and small, I just toss it in my bag and I'm set. Pretty decent for close-up stuff as well like flowers, etc. Overall it's a good starter lens if you're getting it with a kit, but you could probably grab it used for $60 I would guess if you're just looking for a good all-around lens 
I am a portrait professional photographer for over 40 years. I needed a wide angle lens for weddings and wanted to know the quality of the kit lens. I did a test using the Rebel XT kit lens and a Canon 16-35mm lens which costs somewhere around $1,500. I set both cameras at 18mm focal length on a tripod. I took shots outdoors and indoors. The images were done exactly the same. The outdoor shots show objects at infinity as well as 10' away. I made 8x10 prints and showed them to my fellow professional photographers. Nobody could identify which lens took which. This is a real world scenario 
This lens is great for those indoor regular nothing fancy shots. I recently used mine indoors at a restaurant and the distance or close up range was perfect. 
Many people think this is the kit lens. It is not! The numbers do match, but the kit lens is not USM and worth about 1/2 the price. Go to the Canon web site and take a look at the Lens Chart. This lens is much faster and has better glass than the kit lens. 
This is the standard kit lens that comes with the Rebel and 20D. This lens is most definitely built to a budget. And does it ever show! Completely inexcusable is the lack of numbering of ANY kind on the focusing ring. This is VERY frustrating when it comes to taking pictures of distant objects, since you cannot simply set it to infinity. Also, because it goes into macro mode beyond infinity, you cannot simply crank it all the way to one side! Of course, you can always use the autofocus if you wish. But this doesn't work for night photography. In fact, you might as well forget about doing ANY night photography with this lens due to the inability to focus it based on estimation of distance (and the fact that the autofocus doesn't work in the dark). Besides this nagging problem, the lens just is not very sharp. When I first got my Rebel, I was VERY impressed with the pictures it took, since all I had to compare it to were pictures taken by point-and-shoots. But after taking several hundred pictures with it, I find that in most cases, the pictures are VERY much on the soft side. This is a particular problem with distant objects. Even when focused on those distant objects, they never appear really sharp, although objects of intermediate distance (~100ft) seem to be okay. Let's face it. This lens just doesn't have it. Unless you are REALLY hard up for cash, steer clear 
This lens works really fast. It is a great lens. Captures the color in real depth and detail with my Canon 20D camera 
I chose to purchase this lens over the standard 18-55 that comes with the kit XT. It functions smoothly and seems to be worth the difference and is definitely an upgrade. 
Pros: Excellent picture quality, great zoom, nice panoramic feature, SD card, great video and sound quality for a picture camera, the best that you can by for this money and the LCD can rotate in any angle. Cons: Flash does not pop up automatically; just 16mb SD card in the box. PD: this camera size is not a pocket one but the size is good enough to shoot with one hand. Advice: use rechargeable batteries and a large SD card (2 or 4 Gb) cause the video is so good that you will love shooting. Also, must of the times you will need the flash indoor other way you will have bad pics; with flash results will amazed you. 
I initially had a canon S1IS (just 3MP, 10x optical, CF card) and needed an upgrade for the same as I was visiting Disney, LA. The S3IS (6 MP, SD card) delivered with gusto with its image stabilization and higher ISO modes. I have a full video and reasonably good snaps of the Disney parade during the evening darkness (switch to highest ISO with the dedicated ISO button) with: 1. Amazingly low jerkiness due to the image stabilization. The IS here is of course better than the S1IS. 2. The snaps came allright even with the maximum zoom - if there are slight blurs, you can maybe use software like coral to adjust. As others have said here, yes, a tripod is the best, but who has the time or the patience to set it up. 3. Even many of the disney fireworks snaps came out ok in the night mode with the maximum ISO setting - though of course a tripod would have helped in the darkness here, for sure :) 4. Best value for price. In Nov 2006, a nice deal would be getting this camera within 350$ as in Amazon. Two things here: 1. I would not be buying a videocam as I had planned earlier, the S3IS vidoes suffice for most situations - sending videos to AFV for instance. 2. For the last point, I would recommend waiting for 3-4 months till the 4GB SD cards come into the 50$ range. But as others have mentioned before, please have at least a 2GB card. Look in Amazon or in Fry's as I did for 35-40$ deals on 2+ GB cards 
Am very pleased with all aspects of the camera except one. I do not like that the viewfinder is no longer operational once you flip open the LCD screen. Sometimes I like to verify my shot with both 
Great camera, easy to use after reading the manual. Light, easy to handle. Unfortunately a little pricey 
This is my second Canon. There is a lot of whistles and bells on this camera that will take time for the novice to figure out. My biggest complaint is trying to remember to take off the lense cap before turning it on. My other cameras did not have the cap. All in all it takes excellent quality photos, so you will not be disappointed 
Works great as point-and-shoot in auto mode. Camera has just enough advanced features to keep the novice photographer happy for a long time. Battery life is great if you purchase top quality rechargables. A large, at least 1G SD card, should be used. Image stabilization works well. Tripod is necessary if using camera at full zoom 
This is a great camera for those who need more than a point and shoot but do not want to carry a bag full of lenses. Also, with a large SD card (1 to 4 GB) this camera will replace your video camera. One thing to note, when you take pictures while recording video, it stops recording a second or two while it processes your picture. This is very obvious when watching your video 
Over the last 50 years, I have purchased four film cameras and five digital cameras. By far, the Canon S3 IS is the best camera I have owned. And most of the cameras I have bought cost more that the S3. I returned recently from a three-week trip to Scandinavia and St. Petersburg, Russia. During the trip, I took almost 2500 photos with the S3. The photo quality was excellent, the camera controls were easy to use, and the camera performance was outstanding. I expect to use the S3 for many years. 
I bought one when it first came on the market back in May. Half a year and 5,000 pictures later, here are some of my comments: - It is a GREAT digital camera in its own class. By "class" I mean one should not compare it with a dSLR because the S3 is not one. So do not expect it to overcome "shutter lag" easily, although among other DC (digital camera) I have used, shutter lag on S3 is greatly improved--to a degree that I feel comfortable taking photos in very fast pace, e.g., catching flying birds. (However, only good dSLR can completely eliminate shutter lag and S3 is not a dSLR.) One also should not compare the S3 with the "small" point-'n-shoot DCs. S3 is not as small as those--it won't easily slide into your pocket, unless your pocket is relatively big and loose (like mine). But the slightly larger body brings great features none of the small DC can offer. - Big optical zoom (12X) and IS. 12X is GREAT and combined with Canon's Imagine Stabilization, S3 turns into a powerful large zoom camera with superb imagine quality. My recent trips included shooting (with cameras in case you wonder) wild wolf at Yellowstone National Park. And this little S3 came out as the only one that can capture the animals at great distance, along with other "big guns" the professionals carry. The IS feature eliminates hand shake with great effect and I could shoot at 12X with low light and still get quality photos. I also highly recommend the "TC-DC58B Tele Converter Lens" for the S3 (or S2) which gives you another 1.5 zoom that effectively make S3 18X zoom (equivalent to a 600mm lens). Check how much those big telephoto lens cost (close to 10K) ... - Excellent video shooting. Again a feaure one almost never finds on any other DC or dSLR. The S3 takes DVD quality video in stereo sound, not just video clips that most DC can do. This little (almost) pocket-size camera now forces our digital videocam into an early retirement. - Many other great features. However those are more or less standard and one can always try to argue some other DC may have similar or better features. I won't comment on those. In summary, the S3 is a great small-size DC. Its superb lens offers big 12X zoom and IS, two technology of Canon's pride. It also offers DVD video shoot with stereo sound--this feature alone can save you a digital vidoecam. One suggestion--do get a big SD card if you want to shoot video too. I have a 4G SD card and I think 2G is a must. Also battery life is excellent. It uses 4 AA-battery, which seems a lot odd at the beginning. But it comes in handy because as long as you can get AA battery you never worry about power. With typical dSLR, if the battery is out you are done for the day unless you find a power outlet to recharge (and have your charger with you). I do have one small complain. The Menu button at the back of the camera is at the location where my palm presses the body. Sometimes I raise the S3 and I see the menu in viewfinder because my palm has pressed it strong enough to trigger it. Another press is needed and I lost several shots because of this. I have other dSLR with quality lens. But I always take the S3 with me on any trip 
I highly recommend the Raynox DCR 1540Pro Teleconverter for the Canon S2 instead of the Canon branded one. Hoya makes a 67mm UV filter for this and both are available at Lensmate.com. The Canon WC-DC58A wide angle converter however is really good. Tiffen made a better one but it seems to not be available anymore. By the way, the function that the S2 provides for settings using the lens adaptors and teleconvertors are to adjust for the AutoFocus function of the camera and are necessary unless you wish to try to focus yourself using the manual focus which, in my mind, because of the LCD both in the screen as well as in the viewfinder with a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder, is iffy at best. Trust the camera.....it really does an excellent job. One final note, I would recommend using the Focus Bracketing option in lower light situations as the Auto Focus is weak in those situations. 
Fairly decent. Produces pictures with optical blur on the edges if you use zoom. Leaves black semicircle on pictures taken with a flash about 1/5 the way up from the bottom on the picture because the flash isn't tall enough to miss the wide lens. Other than that.. it does capture a few more degrees. If you are going to pick this or the telephoto attachment, get this. 
This lens does exactly what it should. The overall quality is extremely good. Take a look at my photos: - First photo is without the lens - Second photo is with the lens and flash - Third photo is with the lens and without flash There are a few things to note about the photos: - There is a substantial amount of barrel distortion. This is normal. Try not to have straight lines near the borders of the photo to make it less obvious. - Fringing is exaggerated. You notice fringing (purple or blue tints) along high contrast edges of objects that are near the borders. You can see this on regular shots but is more exaggerated with the wide angle lens. - The lens makes a shadow when using the built-in flash. You can see the shadow in the photo with the flash. In a darker environment, it is very obvious. The external flash is the only way to fix this. A couple details: - You can get an extender that is a nice brushed aluminum here: http://www.lensmateonline.com/S2.html - The camera has a setting (Converter) to indicate that you have the lens attached. It's not obvious what it does but it is indicated by a change in the image stabilization icon so I assume that it affects the way that image stabilization works. Overall, I recommend this lens 
I had no investment in a DSLR but narrowed my choices to the Canon 30D and the Nikon D200. I had always wanted a Nikon. The D200 is definitely a joy to hold and it did take good pictures (I tried both at a camera store before I bought the 30D). I did a lot of research (more than I care to admit!) and there was no conclusive evidence that one camera had a clear edge over the other. Depending on your specific needs, one camera may be "slightly better" than the other. After trying out both cameras, I was convinced the 30D was as good a fit for my needs as the D200. For "value for money" the 30D was a clear winner over the D200 (I got mine when Canon had the Cash in with Canon promotion going). Also, as a beginner to SLR I found the 30D with its fully automatic and scene modes easy to start out with. I don't expect to use the scene modes or the full auto mode after a week or two. I expect to quickly graduate to the creative control zones. But to use as a family camera, the quick scene modes are very helpful. If you expect to use it more on a professional basis it'd probably not matter. Additionally, when I checked it out at the store, I noticed the Canon 30D focused sharply almost every time. The D200 did not at least a few times. I'd take this with a grain of salt though since it was a brief trial at a store. But I thought I'd share my experience. It may have just been an anomaly with the actual equipment I tried out. Do I still find the Nikon D200 to be a great camera? Absolutely! Do I regret having bought a Canon 30D? Absolutely not! The decision swinger in my case was really the "money factor". I was more than willing to spend up to $300 more for the Nikon D200. But when the difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable for my Christmas gift to myself:-) My purchases included the Canon 30D [...], Canon 17-85mm EF-S IS USM lens [...], and a SanDisk Extreme III 2GB compact flash card [...] I plan to add an external flash to this soon, and will consider eventual lenses after I determine that the camera is a long-term keeper. 
My 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera cannot keep up with him. And I also don't like the washout look when I uses flash. So I researched about which SLR will best meet my needs, mainly catching fast action, candid moments and low light photos without flash. The Canon 30D comes up top on the list. It has the best high ISO performance in its class (better than Nikon and Sony). And when I combine the 30D with the fast zoom lens EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS, the result is amazing. I can stop any action in daylight, capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode, and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod. Portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background (bokeh). Even the dimly-lit decors of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion came out superb when we went there for the Halloween party at night, without flash or tripod. This is really an important factor for me to buy this camera, as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old. But you will need a good lens to make this work well. If you use a cheap kit lens, then it will probably not matter which camera you pick. Remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens (not the kit lens)and crop the pictures to magnify the details. The Sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and don't need low light performance (use flash and save money). The Nikon has more custom function than Canon, and it is really as good as Canon. They both have their strength and weakness. Canon just happens to have slightly better high ISO performance and that suits my need better than Nikon. To be fair, I should mention that the Nikon D200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year, beating the Canon 30D overall. But the D200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me, better suits someone more serious about photography. The D80 is like a "mini" D200, but slower. So it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend. Shooting in low light without flash will need good high ISO performance, a good fast lens (with wide aperture, usually expensive), and image stabilization. If that's what you want, the Canon 30D with the EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS will not disappoint you 
I compared a number of pro-sumer cameras and became firmly convinced this was the best camera for the money. Although Nikon at one time was considered the premier camera for the professional, they now take second stage to Canon not only for engineering, but for the quality of the lens, innovative and user-friendly design, and overall quality. I have used the camera for approximately one month and have been delighted. Having talken pictures for over 35 years - including professional - and always using Minolta equipment for all of those years, I am truly enamored with this Canon camera 
I am so pleased with this camera! There's really nothing negative I can think to say about it! I also own the Cannon XT. I use both for wedding photography as well as family portraits and I am so impressed with the color quality of the D30! Well done CANNON 
This camera is incredible. I ordered it for my husbands birthday and he is just begining to figure it all out. There are so many great features. One of the best is how quickly you can take digital pictures. Our other digital cameras have a lag time between shots, but not this one. The pictures are crisp and it is easy for even a novice like me to use. I highly recommend this camera if you want to take digital photography to the next level. It is one of the best 
This can be a very easy to use camera. Simply by using the auto mode and composing your pictures properly you can get very good JPEG images. It also can be about as complicated as you want to make it. It has many advanced features on it. I have been shooting 35mm for about 32 years. My most recent before this one being an Elan II E about 7 years ago. It's still working also. The 30d is my first digital and I absolutely love the camera. I generally work in the aperture priority mode with a tripod at 100 ISO when shooting landscape. But, the camera is very capable in auto mode as well without the tripod. I like to shoot RAW so that I can tweek things a bit, but the JPEG images are very acceptable. It also works extremely well for portraits. It actually is better than the 35mm to me because it has very low noise even at higher ISOs. 1600 looks about like 800 film to me. This is a very good value for the money in my opinion 
I have had my Canon Eos 30D for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations I am completely addicted to photography. I bought the 17-85mm Canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in RAW. I also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound. I bought the Camera through Dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there! Strongly recommend. Pay the extra $$$ and get this over the Rebel XTI. You won't be disappointed 
For those who truly know digital cameras, having more than perhaps 8 megapixels is important only if you plan on blowing your images up to "poster size", or if you are a pro who knows how to use all those pixels. And truthfully, how many of you really plan to do that type of stuff? To say that the Rebel XTi is better than the 30D because it "has more megapixels" and is "smaller" is not the best advice. Any Canon DSLR is going to give you great images, if know how to use it. For those of you who are trying to decide which camera to buy, you really need to go to a camera store and ask to handle each camera. While you're at it, ask yourself how it feels in your hands. Is it too bulky? Is it too small and hard to handle? Does it have the features you want such as spot metering, which the Rebel XTi does not have? The 30D is a terrific DSLR. It has all the features 99% of us need. There is a reason why it costs more than the Rebel. The 30D is a better camera overall. 
I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall 
Though I am not qualified to write about the quality of the filters, they seem to be doing the job pretty well. The finish is good and they fit well with the 58 mm Canon lense for my Rebel XT. The lense cap goes right over it so it is doubly protected. The small pouch to hold the three filters is also of big help to keep them safe and easily accessable 
These are the second set of filters I have purchased and I am absolutely love it. I have to buy a new set because my other lense is 62mm and these are for 58mm. It produced outstanding colors and great quality filters. I would recommend it, and for the price, that's how much you would have to pay for the polarizer filter alone 
I purchased the filter kit for my Sony Camera. The price is considerably cheaper than Sony's and the quality is great! I'm looking into other items offered at a good price from Opteka 
Good fit, works as advertised, stores on lens. Helps keep night dew off the lens as well as unwanted light out during the day 
Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shaped offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Being shallow and petal shaped, this type of protection is also limited. Even if the protection is limited, replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing the lens and easier to replace. This hood is manufactured for the Canon 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS EF and normally is not included with the lens when sold new. Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering. Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. This lens itself isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem. While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. PROS: Improves contrast and image quality Reduces lens flare problems Offers limited protection to the lens CONS: Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens 
Pros: - Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element. - Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile 
I was really pleased with my item! Amazon shipped in phenomenal packaging! thanks... 
Excellent product works well. Made for the Canon EF28-135mm Lense. Reasonable price 
I'm still learning to use this camera and all the features. So far it is amazing. I've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots. I use the auto mode a lot and it works great. The zoom is amazing. I love that it tells me when I am focused. Also it has great battery life. I'm very happy with this camera 
This camera has lot of modes that you can use. It has very good resolution and optical zoom. With 12x optical zoom you can click awesome pictures, specially in live performances and sightseeing trips. 5 MP resolution is more than enough, otherwise the pics become just too big to fit in one screenshot. You can also panoramic pictures with it. Another big advantage is that Windows recognized this camera as soon as I connected it using the USB cable that comes with it, transferring pics to PC becomes very simple. The only two complaints are - flash recycling time should have been lesser, and the SD card that comes with it is only 16 MB, which is hardly enough for 7-8 pics. You will have to buy a 512 MB or 1 GB SD card separately. Also, the batteries that come with it are not rechargeable, so you will have to buy charger and batteries as well, which are not so expensive. But these drawbacks are there in S3IS also. Overall, this camera gives very clear pictures and is worth buying if you happen to get it at a decent price. 
This is a great camera, easy to use, love the quality and even best, got this quick as can be with Amazon PRime. HIghly recommen 
When I first got the camera I was nervous about whether or not I'd be able to use understand it well since I usually buy point shoot type camera. I was pleasantly surprised on how easy it is to use all the functions it really has. The pictures are really high quality the video is crystal clear. The camera's lightweight perfect to grab on the go or to capture any occasion. I like the design of it I love the fact that I can get professional looking pictures time time again... 
I got this Canon camera back in May for my birthday from my husband. Once I got it home it was very easy to learn and use. I have actually not even used all the features yet...because there are so many. This is my 3rd digital camera and 1st canon...I have to say that I will stick with canon for now on...I use to always like Kodak but canon is much better. I print off the pictures using my Kodak printer and everything still looks great! I love canon so much that I just bought a Canon Camcorder ...and I hope that it is just as nice as their digital cameras. I highly recommend this camera for families...I have used it in live action and after you get the hang of the image stabilizer everything turns out well.....I feel that I will use this camera for a while and when it's time to upgrade to another camera I will stick w/ Canon.. 
I bought the Canon PowerShot S2 IS about a year ago, and have taken about 2,500 photos and about 15 video clips with it. Overall, I am very happy with it, and if I were buying a new camera today, I probably would get the S2 or S3. Things I like about the S2: * Extended zoom (12x). I use it often. * Image stabilization. Particularly helpful when using a high zoom factor, or when shooting in low light with a low ISO setting. It makes handheld shots at slow shutter speeds possible. * Electronic viewfinder means "what you see is what you get", just like an SLR. While not as sharp as an optical viewfinder, the ability to frame the picture without worrying about parallax more than makes up for it. In fact, one advantage over an SLR is that there is no mirror for it to move out of the way, therefore there is no mirror noise when taking a picture; if you turn off the electronic sound effects, it is very quiet indeed (although not completely silent). * The screen moves and rotates. I like that it can be closed (turned in toward the camera) and thus protected from scratches. I have used it folded out and rotated forward in order to see myself in a self-timer photo. I have used it to take "clandestine" pictures--holding the camera down near my waist, I can still see the screen if I rotate it towards me. I have also used it to take pictures while holding the camera above my head--above a crowd, for instance, or over a wall. * Multiple-picture mode. Similar to a motor drive in film cameras, this allows me to take several pictures in quick succession by holding down the shutter release button--about 2 pictures per second. And unlike some cameras, the only limit to the number of pictures is the amount of available memory. * It can be used in all-automatic mode, all-manual mode, or just about any combination in between. Even in near-automatic mode, several exposure settings can be adjusted. * Very good movie mode. It will shoot a VGA-quality picture (640x480) at 30fps. While the results are not as good as my 3-CCD DV video camera, I am much more likely to have this camera with me than the video camera, and I really like the option of taking a reasonably high quality video. I have used it several times. * Stereo microphones. Decent sound for video. Can also be used for adding a sound memo to a still picture (e.g. "this is at such-and-such a place, blah blah blah"), or just for recording sounds unrelated to any picture. I have used this a couple of times to record a "sound memory" of a place; one was at a botanical garden at a spot where the scenery wasn't especially pretty, but the sounds the frogs made were like nothing we had heard before! * Separate buttons for still pictures and movies. Easy to remember which is which. * Manual pop-up flash. Some people don't like that the flash doesn't pop up automatically when needed. I actually like this feature, because often I want to shoot without a flash when the camera thinks I need to use the flash. And of course I can force the flash to fire even in bright daylight when the camera thinks it is not necessary--although for a while I kept forgetting how to turn on that feature on, even though it's pretty obvious (there's a button right next to the flash!). Things I don't like about it: * Poor low-light performance. More precisely, poor performance at high ISO settings. The camera will do fine in low light if you leave the shutter open long enough, or use a flash. But if you kick up the ISO to 200 or 400 (equivalent to a "fast" film) so that you can take indoor shots without a flash, you end up with very noticeable graininess in the pictures. This is my number one disappointment with the camera. However, I don't know of a comparable camera that does better (and from the sample pictures I have seen, the S3 isn't any better; I don't know why they bothered to add an ISO 800 setting--it seems completely useless to me). I know there are cameras that do, but they cost a lot more. I saw pictures taken indoors with a Canon 20D SLR that were phenomenal. But besides the added expense, a camera like that is also bigger and heavier, and therefore less convenient. * The camera is too big for a pocket. I would love to have a camera as capable as this that would fit in my shirt pocket, or at least my coat pocket or a smallish holster. I would take it more places if it wasn't so big. * And yet, at the same time, it's a little too small for my hand. The grip just doesn't feel right. The grip on the 20D felt GREAT! However, it's just about right for a woman's hand--my wife likes it fine. * No filter threads in the standard configuration. A big lens like that is practically begging for fingerprints or scratches. I solved that by adding the conversion lens adapter, which does have filter threads (more about this below). * Lens cap is held on by friction. This is both a pro and a con. It's good because the lens extends when the camera is turned on; if the lens cap is attached the lens will simply push it off. It's bad because the cap could come off when you don't want it to. This is a moot point with the conversion lens adapter, as the standard lens cap will no longer fit. * The default exposure is too bright. Not every review mentions this, but apparently it is fairly common for Canon cameras. Fortunately, this is easily fixed by setting the exposure adjustment (I set mine to -2/3 stop). I haven't figured out how to adjust the exposure for movies, though. I need to look in the manual to see if it's possible! If you buy the S2 (or S3), I'd suggest also considering: * Canon LAH-DC20 Lens Adapter and Hood Set. As I mentioned above, this allows you to add a filter to protect the lens. Currently $37.10 at Amazon. * A 58mm skylight or UV filter to screw on to the lens adapter. * A 58mm lens cap to cover the adapter/filter. Canon's 58mm Snap-On Lens Cap is currently $9.99 at Amazon. * A high-speed SD card, at least 512MB, but 1GB or 2GB would give more space for movies. (I use a SanDisk Ultra II Plus, which has the added benefit of being able to directly plug into a standard USB port without an adapter.) * Rechargeable NiMH batteries. I don't have any yet, but this is the next thing on my list. I've gone through way too many AA batteries! A nice option available for this camera is the TC-DC58B Tele Converter Lens. This gives you a maximum zoom equivalent to 648mm on a 35mm camera. Amazing! I have not purchased it yet because so far the built-in zoom has been sufficient for my needs. There is also the WC-DC58A Wide Converter Lens for taking extra-wide-angle pictures. After you get the camera, you'll probably want a case of some type for it. There are *lots* of cases to choose from. After trying a few and looking at a lot more, I finally settled on the Tamrac Velocity 4. It may or may not be what you need in a case, but there it is FYI 
Are accessories like the lens converters, the wide angle and long angle lenses, and the filters that I purchased for the Canon Powershot S1 IS compatible with the Canon Powershot S2 IS or the Canon Powershot S3 IS? I am looking to updgrade, and I want to know what costs I will have other than the camera itself and the memory (since the S1 IS used Compact Flash memory). Thanks 
I started looking for the earlier version of this flash and when I saw the upgrades on the 430EX I didn't hesitate to order it. It's what I've needed to take my photos to a higher level. I shoot for two magazines and now instead of taking my studio light into every shoot, I still carry it with me, I use this flash instead and it makes a world of difference 
I purchased this along with my new Canon 30D DSLR. I mainly use it for fills in outside sunny days, but it has been used to light up the situation. I'm personally still learning about how to best angle the light to get the best outcome, but I don't think it'll take long 
Excellent addition for Rebel XT. Tried lower cost generic flash units. My only regret is that I waited so long to get the 430EX 
This is a very nice flash unit that integrates well with the PowerShot Pro1 camera. I appreciate the zooming strobe tube to match the lens focal length as well as the ability to bounce the flash off the ceiling for softer effects. I should have purchased this flash when I first got the Pro1 camera 
Does the job and the Canon E-TTL II is a nice feature but I wish they would provide a battery indicator like on the Canon DSLR cameras 
I am very pleased with this product... Shoots well in all types of different light conditions, even when it is pitch black the 430EX takes a decent shot at close range... 430EX adds a deeper color and warmth to pictures in conditions where light is lacking... I am a graphic designer and need great photo's when I begin work and the 430EX helps with the process of a more clear and colorful photo when shooting with my Rebel EOS XT Digital Camera... 
This is a great unit. Works great for the purpose for which it was made. I'm going to eventually get the 580 so I can use it as a slave unit (with the wireless option) for a wraparound lighting system. I would recommend a diffuser so that the light can be subdued especially when you wish to brighten the fleshtones of the people in the photo with golden light so they are presented in their best image. Blue spectrum light does not present us in the best way 
it works great, there are just two issues. when you lock it on the hot shoe, it can be very, very difficult to unlock (you twist a wheel to tighten it on) and when the batteries in my camera are low, the camera and the flash start having computer problems and act very strange (i have a cannon digital rebel xt). other than those towo issues, which in comparison seem very small to me, the flash is fantastic! lightweight and easy to use 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
I bought this lens to replace an EF 100-300mm (USM) that we had from my wife's film shooting days (not a common lens to have, apparently; the 75-300mm seems to be more widespread). That older lens produced some surprisingly good pictures (quite sharp), but handheld shots were hard to get right at long focal lengths. The image stabilization feature of this lens works remarkably well, but it's quite a bit noisier than that of the EF-S 17-85mm IS (my first IS lens; you hardly hear the IS gyrations at all on that one). The sharpness is quite good (probably a tad better than that of the EF 100-300mm, although it's not a foremost strength of this lens in my opinion). I was surprised by how much faster I can acquire focus with this lens, even though reviews suggested that it still falls short of L-series lenses (see e.g. the "flying gull" shot I uploaded to the "customer images" set). If you want to shoot hand-held at 150mm+, I don't think this lens has much competition under $1000 for Canon EOS users 
Great company - delivered product on time. Tested out the lens in Mexico, Brazil, and Canada. When the automatic settings on camera (Canon 10D) were selected and pictures were taken outdoors with a lot of daylight, the background is overexposed. This results in things like clouds not being included in the picture. Manual settings and adjustments within the camera will remedy the problem. However, there is an expectation that lens from Canon should take quality pictures from the automatic setting. Otherwise the lens works great 
This is a terrific lens, my new favorite. IS is an excellent feature; I wish all my lenses had it. Even with a 2X Teleconverter on, it is rock steady viewing and shooting. My images are sharp as a tack with great contrast and color. I'd have to pay three times this much to get any better telephoto images 
The Canon EF 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM telephoto zoom lens replaces the first Image Stabilizer lens of its kind, the Canon 75-300mm f4-5.6 telephoto zoom lens. It offers now up to three - as opposed to two - apertures in image stabilizing mode, as well as slightly wider focal length. The current June 2006 Popular Photography issue has a fine test report on this lens, showing that it is capable of excellent contrast and resolution in the range from 70mm to 200mm; at 300mm, both contrast and resolution decline slightly to very good, but still an excellent result for a zoom lens in this class. It is also fully compatible with Canon's digital SLR cameras (112-480mm equivalent), with improved lens coatings optimised for digital sensors. Without question this is an excellent lens for the Canon photographer interested in excellent nature and landscape photography, without resorting to a sturdy tripod to hold both the camera and lens; thus it is also quite suitable for handhold panning shots at most outdoor sporting events held under good weather conditions 
This is a good zoo lens. It is not as heavy or noticeable as something like the 100-400 L lens. Also, with the 3 stop IS and smaller size and weight this makes a great backup lens to the 100-400 on trips or when I just don't feel like carrying around a 3+ pound lens all day. So if you don't want to have to deal with the cost or size of an L series lens this is one of the next best options 
After debating between this and the 70-200 L series I decided to purchase this lens. I have been pleasantly surprised by the results. I also own the 17-85 and the 50mm 1.8 lenses and I have found that I have gotten the "most pleasing" results from this lens. The pictures have been very sharp from my 20D - even in the 200mm - 300mm range. I've also been happy with the quality of the bokeh. The primary drawback I see is that the AF tends to hunt a fair amount when confronted with low contrast images. That being said, I used it for some flying bird shooting at the wildlife refuge and was surprised to see how many of the shots were in sharp focus. However, it was a little bit of all or nothing. Several shots were also wildly out of focus. Since the lens is fairly slow to focus, you never know what you're gonna get with such a fast moving object against the distant sky. I had much more consistent results when shooting soccer, softball and football in the park. The AF speed did not present an issue for any of these activities and the results were excellent. I wish the lens were a little less expensive but I the prints I have gotten from my 13 X 19 printer have been worth the extra money 
This Canon Lens upholds the tradition of fine products from the Canon line of photographic accessories. It takes very clear, sharp, hand held pictures with the Image Stabilizer capability activated. It negates the necessity of carrying a tripod every time one wants to take long telephoto shots. It should be a must for any serious photographer that wanders the countryside, taking candid pictures, and wants to lighten the load of equipment carried 
I am lifelong photographer and I purchased this camera in January. I have taken it on several major trips. It is an wonderful performer. I have many 11x14 enlargements that I have received terrific feedback on. The quality of this camera and the Cannon optics will not disappoint. The price is right now that the replacement is out. 
Wonderful camera. Very flexiable, very versitile. Can be the most wonderful creation device in someone whom is capable. Def a good buy now that the 30D is out. I've had this camera for over a year and I STILL love it 
Excellent Camera with high end capabilities. Easy to use and intuitive system controls 
I am just a hobbyist. This was a big purchase and a big step for me to get into this level of camera. I still haven't mastered using it yet, and I've had it for a few months. It does a wonderful job of taking pictures. If you have the right lenses, it can take some of the most beautiful pictures you've ever seen. Again, I'm just a hobbyist/enthusiast. I use it to take pictures for work, too. I highly recommend getting a couple of VERY good lenses to go with it. Don't go with the cheap lenses that Canon, Tamron, Sigma, etc. make for this camera. Do yourself a favor and get a nice zoom - spend some bucks. You'll be happy you did. The camera itself is pretty easy to use if you leave it on auto, but that's like buying a race car and never shifting out of first gear. The auto settings are great, and they do a wonderful job, but you can do so much more if you learn to use the camera in Manual, Av, Tv, or P mode. It allows you so much more creativity that you'll be amazed at the difference. The 30D came out right before I bought the 20D, and I would probably buy it for the price now, but I'm very happy with my 20D 
Impressive feature list wih affordable price, for the serious ameteur. i've been using the 20D with 18-55, 50mm 1.8, 35-80, 80-200 and 500/1000mm lenses. i am not disappointed. i am planning to upgrade to the L series lenses but slowly. i do not mean to be over entusiastic about canon, but i am yet to see a Nikon camera with the same specs at the same or ever a near equal price. i've got the FM10 for film photography. i love both my cameras. Impressive features include: Mirror lockup ISO 3200 with noise reduction 18 custom functions accepts the entire series of canon lens. heavy metal body (no cheap plastic feel 
This camera is amazing, I couldn't have asked for more. Just be warned that the manual is pretty terrible. It's best to just play around with the camera until you figure it out, rather than wasting time trying to decipher the manual 
My kids are in competitive Tae Kwon Do. I have now used the camera my wife gave me one year ago at several tournaments. It is able to stop action and take great shots even in low lighting. Now, we tried it when we went skiing and it also worked great in the glare conditions of the snow. I bought a monopod that worked real well to stabalize and I use software called PhotoFinale to crop and share the photos. One year into the usage I am still looking forward to each chance I get to play with this "toy". Next options: battery grip, flash diffuser, extra remote flash.. 
I bought this camera about 2 months before my son was born. I knew little about Digital SLRs, but after research I found that this was the one for me. This camera is well constructed and durable. The pictures are excellent. I have blown a few of my pictures up to 11X17 without any problem. Also, if you are going to be doing any editing of photos on your computer, this camera would be great. I would recommend purchasing the newest version of Photoshop or Photoshop elements (when I bought mine it only came with Elements 2.0 and 3.0 was already on the market). Also, if you want your pictures to turn out, you MUST purchase a larger flash. The onboard flash is weak, will leave shadows and it does not allow you to do any type of "bounce" flash. On the whole, this is the best camera I have ever had in my life and it would be great for anyone who has previous experience with SLR cameras. 
Works well on a normal camera Tried it with adapter on S3 IS and adapter does not fit robustly. Filter is O 
I was concerned when I ordered this filter about the previous problems reported here. But, I was in a hurry and needed two of these for vacation. There was absolutely no problem with the product. Both filters were sealed and in perfect condition. Could have been packed a little better in the shipping box, but arrived in good condition. No problems with photos taken with this product 
I took a few identical photos with and without this filter, and saw no difference in sharpness nor contrast. So, if you're looking to save damage to your lense, this is the way to go. I like being able to clean this filter quickly. Otherwize I would spend 10-20 minutes cleaning the lense being so very carefull not to scratch it. Also, it can minimize UV haze... but I havn't compared with/without for that type of situation. (PLEASE COMMENT IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ... (BRAND) 
Ordered one in March and its came in fine (not used or abused like others have mentioned). Amazon.com was the retailer. I use it mostly for the lens protection aspect and it works great, in fact I'm ordering another right now 
I never take my UV filter off of my lens unless I am going to immediately put on a different filter. There are basically two camps out there, those that feel you should always use a UV filter to protect your lens from dirt and scratches and those that feel it is a waste of time and only degrades your image. Well, I tried going without one for awhile and then dirt started to build up on the front element of my very expense lens. And although you can clean the front element of a lens, I feel much, much safer wiping my comparatively cheap UV filter time and time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage. I think for the nearly unquantifiable loss in image quality you may suffer by having a UV filter on, it is well worth the extra piece of mind it gives me 
I was looking for a medium range zoom for my D-70s that was reasonably fast and sharp throughout the zoom range. This lens is a first class winner in all areas. It is my first VR lens (vibration resistance) and that alone makes it worth the cost. No more tripods! It is smooth in operation and feels very solid (if not a little heavy) to use. The f/2.8 speed coupled with 8 aperture leaves gives a velvety smooth bokeh (desirable soft blurred background) that makes your subject snap right out of the shot. The len is razor sharp from 70mm to 200mm. If there is any distortion, I haven't seen it. With a lens this long, ghosting might show up if you shoot almost directly into the sun. The huge HB-29 lens hood helps a lot. Again, I have not seen any ghosting yet. This is definately a pro/pro-sumer len and its price tag alone re-enforces that fact. If you can afford it, remember the golden rule...it is the lens that makes the picture not the camera. All the pixels in the world can't make up for a poor lens. If you are ready to play with the big boys, then this belongs in your bag 
This lens is superb. It feels like a high quality pro lens (not surprisingly). The shots are just stunning; fantastic color, razor sharp, beautiful bokeh etc etc. I initially considered the 18-200(VR) until I saw comments about this lens. Look into it, from what I can tell there is very little (real) comparison between the two. I believe you will forget how much you paid as soon as you see the results. Did I mention this lens is superb....? 
This lens has so many uses. Anytime I can position myself where my subject is more than five feet away, this is my lens of choice. I have the kit 18-70mm that came with the D70 and a 50mm prime (I have the 18-200 VR is on order, and if Nikon can ever get around to catching up with demand, that lens might surpass this one, due to the smaller weight - plus it is a lot cheaper). I took every lens I own with the D70 to the British Museum in London. Shooting handheld in available light (I never used the flash) with many of the Egyptian and Greek artifacts over fifty feet away, I got outstanding results with this lens. The VR technology is amazing. Having a constant 2.8 aperture was also a major advantage. I'll grant you my arm felt like a rubber hose after four hours of site seeing, but it was worth it! I have had similar satisfaction using the lens outdoors for wildlife photography. I have even used the TC-20EII teleconverter with the lens, to shoot hummingbirds at great distance. I would have no reservations about recommending the lens, until Nikon announced the 18-200 VR. This new lens has a much broader focal length on the low end, and focuses much closer (around a foot, compared to five feet for 70-200). The 18-200 does not provide a constant 2.8 aperture across it's focal length, so the 70-200 would be better at long distances in low light. But at less than half the price, and I think less than half the size, this new lens clearly will have a premier spot in my bag. Will it totally replace the 70-200VR? I'll update my review when I finally get to try the lens on the block. Until then, the 70-200mm VR is the champ 
This is it. I upgraded from the Sigma EX f2.8 80-200. I should have spent the money for the Nikon the first time. The Sigma is a very nice lens for less, and a good alternative, but if you want it all, go for the Nikon. Leave your tripod at home when you get this glass. I don't know how this compares, but I'm shooting hand held with 1/30s shutter at full zoom (35mm equivalent of 300mm). The VR is phenomenal, the wide aperature delivers beautiful blur, and the overall fit and construction is flawless. Tack sharp images too 
I love this lens. This is an excellent complement to my Nikon 28-70 2.8. It is well balanced on D200 and F100 (with MB Grip). Just last weekend used in a Family Wedding. It is really not a lens for casual photography. If you are not willing to tolerate heavy equipment, sincerely, you will take much better pictures with PS digital cameras, as I sometimes do. After all taking pictures is about capturing moments and if this lens will get into your way, it has no use. I personally only prefer fixed 2.8 apertures across the zoom range. This is very important for me since I like to use mostly Aperture Priority especially taking people's pictures. That is why I love this lens. This is a very expensive lens. If VR is not important to you, go with more reasonably priced with almost identical optical qualities Nikon 80-200 2.8. To me VR is very important since I cannot afford to use Tripods when I am moving around and taking pictures of my kids or friends. If you could afford it, it is a great lens that you will never regret. If you cannot afford it just you are thinking on purchasin expensive Camera Body, don't waste your time on camera specs, D70 vs D200 vs D2Xs etc. Buy cheaper camera, but still buy this lens as long as you are willing to carry heavy equipment around and comitted to take pictures with such heavy equipment. Bokeh is amazing, rich contrast, creamy blurring behind a subject with 2.8 is simply delicate and delicious 
Yes, this lens is already legend, and no, it's not just a bunch of people trying to justify spending a whole lot of cash on a lens. Make no mistake, this lens is BIG and expensive. It's not fitting into your travel bag nor is it at home at a friend's party. For that bring the 18-70mm, 28-200G or just bring a cheaper P type camera in case you spill beer on it! The 70-200 VR is a pro level lens that gets almost everything right. It's size is the byproduct of an optical design that really makes few, if any compromises. This lens is SHARP...as sharp as my 50mm prime and sharper wide open that you might believe or expect. On a D70 the focus is lightening fast and quite exact. Color rendition is the best I've seen. I do much less post processing when this baby is on the D70. On the problematic side, this lens is BIG. It's heavy and in the way, though reasonably easy to grasp. I added a Harbortronics portrait grip and the handling/balance is improved. It needs a big bag and focuses down to a bit under 5 feet. While it's a fantastic portrait lens, you need room to get the most out of it. My first shots with this lens put my more experienced lenses to shame. The bokeh, or quality of out-of-focus areas were creamy and pleasing. Subjects had a 3D quality to them. The VR system is exactly what you'd expect. I sat on my couch, framed the text on my DVD player about 8 feet away and shot at F/2.8 ISO 200 for a 1/2 second exposure. At 200mm (300mm on the D70) the image was sharp. Without VR I got a big blur. The real question is: Do you need a 1700 dollar lens? Answer: Only if you want it. The quality is all there at a level that has people talking about this lens like it's magic. I have friends who shoot pro with Canon and Nikon. Even the Canon users say the 70-200VR is the best of it's kind. Sell a kidney and buy one 
This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens. 
Filter works good for general use and protects against some of the light relection. I would purchase it again 
I buy this UV filter to protect my kit lens(18-55mm), so far so good. I am using a canon rebel xd. If you just want to get a cheap UV to protect your lens, buy this one 
It is better to save the camera's real lens which can be replaced with this filter being broken than the expensive lens behind it. This is a real "lens saver" 
I get at least a UV filter for all my lenses. That's the cheapest insurance you can get for you lense. Protect it from possible scratches and banging against objects. Haven't really seen a major difference between the brand filter and the Tiffen filter. I would just go with the cheapest filter to be found for you lens 
After overpaying at a fancy camera store, I was happy to purchase an identical filter from amazon for a fraction of the price. These filters give you piece of mind, protection from sand, fingerprints and baby spittle 
very happy with the quality of the pics but most of it...it's size..it is really really small one...but really powerful for it's size...overall performance is pretty good..had it for a week . everything looks good till now..except for the sd card provided with it..it's practically useless.You can take only 8-9 pics at full resolution.Would definately suggest everyone to buy atleast a 512 mb card but overall i m satisfied with the purchase and Amazon's service is as usual "A" rate 
I bought this camera about 6 mos. ago for a trip to Europe. It is great, the photos come out crisp and clear, the optical zoom is great, and there are several manual features, although this is not the camera for those who enjoy extensive custom settings. For what I wanted, a small poin-and-shoot digital camera, this fits the bill. There are some areas for improvement that Canon can continue to work on. While I am glad that they left the viewfinder in this model as the LCD is a bit difficult to see during really sunny days. Whenever I connect the USB cable to the camera, I am afraid I am going to break off the little cover to the USB port on the camera. Finally, I know the lithium ion battery enables the case to be smaller, but I really wish I could grab a battery off the shelf in the supermarket 
This is a very good compact camera, but there are a few things that make some pictures a problem. When shooting in low light conditions there seem to be a lot of problems with the flash, especially if I take pictures of kids. Flash makes the person/object way too light, no matter what kind of flash I use auto/on/red eye etc. If I try not to use the flash, then there is a lot of blur. When outside in the bright sun most images are way too light. I will be very grateful to anyone who knows how to resolve these problems. It can be a little frustrating. I tried every possible setting, but so far no luck 
I am only giving 4 stars, because i just receive it through mail a couple days ago. So i still haven't get a chance to fully try out everything. But I can tell you this camera is very handy, it's very small that i can throw it in my small purse (my purse usually don't have much room, b/c i would already had so much stuff in it, like my PDA, i-pod, cell phone, wallet, keys, a pack of tissue and et.c) and take it with me to anywhere. I love the design of this camera, it's very cool. Pictures are pretty clear, even the one taking during the nights. Another thing that i love about this camera is that it's not noisy, and it's very quick (i have no patience, so it's good for me that i can snap pictures crazy quickly). Overall, I find this camera pretty good. 
I recently purchased this camera and it is very easy to use and takes nice pictures. I bought a case to put it in so I could keep the screen from getting scratched. Go out and find a generic camera bag that will fit it. They are so much cheaper than Canon's camera bags. The only thing about this camera that I would like to change is that I wish it had a battery life indicator. 
This camera fits easily in my pocket and takes fantastic pictures for an ultra compact. It is easy to use and I have had no problems with it 
I like Canon's digital camera because it is everything an average person may want. It is light, with great design, works incredibly good and I can make hundreds of pictures. Isn't is a dream come true? Highest recommendation 
This tripod was a total shock! I was amazed at the quality, stability and portability. The heavy duty denier carrying case is a great bonus. The level and quick release were also a welcome surprise. This was the best $9.00 I ever spent for photography accessories. 
I have a Nikon D50, and when attaching the camera, the tilting base of the tripod needs a little compensation for the camera weight. Hence, I haven't found any use for the libelle on the tripod. I have to look through the wiev finder to see if my set-up is level or not. Overall though, it's not a big problem, and hey, with the price of the tripod, I'll live with it 
I have a very small camera (a Canon SD450) and find this tripod to be a perfect match. It is light and small and easy to carry with the included canvas case. It has a few nice features that I didn't expect (even though I read the text!) like the bubble level on the platform. This product is an excellent value. However, the shipping cost as much as the tripod. Of course, that is not the tripod's fault. 
I really looked hard at the various light (sub-3 lb) tripod options to use with my Canon Powershot S2 IS. Lighter the better, but I also really wanted a 3-way pan head and all of the little nice extras that I could get: bubble level, quick set-up/tear-down, fits inside of carry-on luggage, good build quality, comes with a bag, good hand crank, etc. It definitely fit the bill perfectly, and was ONLY 2 lbs! Of course you don't get super strong wind-proof stability at that weight, but I was really quite happy with the overall stability on my recent vacation. When there was a strong wind, I leaned a bag, backpack, or beach towel around one of the legs and that gave me more piece of mind... but I think it probably would have been fine... especially when not fully extended to max height. Before buying it, the max height was actually my only real concern -- would it be tall enough to take good people pictures/outdoor portraits while I was on my vacation? My experience says -- Yes, great people shots (and so much better than the typical shot you get by asking a passing by stranger to take a photo for you)! Don't hesitate, just buy this one! 
I received this tripod for Christmas and I am totally delighted with it! It comes with a case and is small and light enough for me to carry. In just a few days use, it has made a difference on my low light level and non-flash photos 
The previous review is not completely correct. The problem is not with the product but with the description what amazon.com put up for the Canon CPM-E3 Battery Magazine. It is a battery magazine for the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3 and not for the camera battery grip. I think the product itself is a great thing, it lets you switch the whole magazine with 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing the batteries in the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3. The previous reviewer should not judge a product by the incorrect infromation given by a retailer 
This stuff worth for your small money, useful for your precious cameras 
It seems unfair to compare this camera to a 10D (or 20D or 30D), either favorably or unfavorably. These instruments are good in their own right, but hardly are in the same league as the 1DS Mark II. I have used all three of the xxD's, and an original 1ds body as well. It occurs to me that the folks who are interested in shelling out over 5 grand for a camera already have an idea about what they want, and that some of them are asking if they should trade in their 1ds body for a mark ii. It is to them that I am adressing this review. The remarks, I think will help those who have less experience with the line. Bear with me for the technical jargon and the emphais on Mark I vs II comparison. I want to help the buyer to decide if there really is a reason to spend this kind of money. First, regarding resolution: you probably won't be able to tell the difference between Mark I and Mark II unless you are doing studio work. An 8x10 image is virtually indistinguishable. Most of us shoot in .jpg mode, and we don't mess with RAW. If you are doing a 17x20 wedding portrait and are working with uncompressed files, the Mark II is superior. I do outdoor work, so 11.6 megapixels is plenty. Finallyl, the quality of the glass makes a big difference (much more than the sensor resolution), so if you are a little strapped for cash, buy a 5D and spend the difference on "L" series lenses, or a used 1DS (Mark I). Second: Ergonomics. I like the histogram on the Mark II better than the older camera, and appreciate the improved burst performance, and storage times. Small but significant differences. The battery life is way better, and I like that. I can get 700 frames out of a charge in the Mark II and only 200 from the Mark II. Thank you, Canon. Maybe in the next iteration they will do something with the black brick of a charger. I can only hope. Third: Sensor noise. Most ofthe high-end cameras are CMOS now, and each time we look at a new generation of pictures we are wowed by the decrease in sensor noise at high ISO's. I remember that the we praised the Mark I for the low noise up to ASA 400. For the uninitiated, sensor noise is the random firing of a sensor due to quantum effects, and manifests as sparkle or random changes in pixel color. It is more prominent in low light and high ASA. The Mark I is great up to ASA 400, good up to 800 and needs some digital filtering at 1200. The Mark II is really good up to ASA 1600, and with a Photoshop filter is good to 3200. If you shoot in low light, the Mark II is for you. Fourth: Color balance. I always loved the warm, saturated pictures that the Mark I gives, so don't get me wrong - better color rendition is not a reason to sell it for a new model. The Mark II, though, improves on it and gives beautiful color saturation with some improvement in the range of highligts. Digital photo buffs will know what I mean: if you take a picture with broad highlights, like a sky, the foreground objecst will be underexposed. and the highlights clear. Set the exposrue to the foreground, and the sky will be a burnt-out white. The Mark II has improved this much, but it still needs some work by Canon. For now, it helps to have taken a large number of pictures to get an idea as to how to set the exposure. Fifth: Accuracy of the exposure. The Mark I had an annoying tendancy to overexpose by about a stop. I got used to turning down the exposure 1-2 stops, exposing on the highlights, and using Photoshop to correct the exposure. The Mark II is more accurate, and the Manual exposure is close to the metered exposure. Sixth: The FF/1.6 business. I really don't see any reason that a 30D is a better camera because a 50mm lens gives an image analagous an 85mm lens in a full frame camera. Be advised, though, that lens evaluations depend on this distinction. Edge performance and flair may be more obvious on a full frame instrument. Both the 1DS and the 1DS Mark II tend to challenge lenses more because they work the full range of the lens from side to side and through the apertures. My 35-135 IS Canon lens gave great pictures on the 10D, but looks washed out on both of the 1Ds's. Before giving the 1DS Mark II a bum rap for less than perfect pictures, ask what lens was used. Seventh: Price. Presently, a non-grey-market 1DS Mark II sells for around $6899 from reputable dealers. A used Mark I is around half that. I would take a half star away from Canon for the pounding my pocketbook is taking, but I understand that a Mark I was just about the same price when it was released. The price gradient presently would be tolerable for those shooting in low light, or for RAW studio work. Personally, I would buy a Mark I over a 5D for the improved construction. Finally, some general remarks. I would have liked to compare this fine camera to the comparable Nikon. Unfortunately, I cannot, because all my glass is Canon, and I have no money left for a mult-thousand buck purchase of a Nikon. Maybe someone else would write a review. My only beefs with Canon have to do with sensor dust, that seems to appear by spontaneous generation, and the steep learning curve that I had with my first use. (Plan on a night or two reading the manual) I guess I can forgive them for not putting a flash in it. Add a couple of hundred to the price for the purchase of a 580EX. Canon service has been terrific. If you have the bucks, quit complaining about the price and get one if you are a serious photographer. Look at the images in dpreview.com (and the long, thoughtful review there), and at fredmiranda.com - they will leave you breathless. This is a serious instrument for serious photographers and far be it from me to give it less than 5 stars for my petty complaints 
Ive gotten used to the disposable kodaks i got from the checkout isle at walmart. The problem with those, though, is that they run out of pictures pretty quick. The last straw was when we ran out of film at the family reunion just as cousin billy was about to show us how to catch a lizard with a rubber band and a twinky. At that point I knew I needed an upgrade. I ordered the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II the next day, for [...] The feature that first caught my attention was the powerful zoom. Now when I take a family picture, I like to step back about a mile or two, then zoom in and snap that high-resolution masterpeice. My wife always complains that i zoom too close into the big pores on her nose, to which i respond by suggesting she use clean and clear pore cleansing strips (watch for her upcoming review of those soon). Another useful feature of this camera is the continuous shooting mode. This is where the camera automatically takes pictures in rapid succession, about 5 per second. The other day I set the camera on the dresser, turned on the macarena, and got wild. I then took the individual pictures and strung them together into an animated flipbook. Now watching myself do the macarena is a mere flip of the book away. Man i can dance. To summarize, you will have a lot of fun with this cam like i did. Definitely worth the [...] ! But remember, there is a [...] that comes with it; so make sure you fill in the item number clearly on the [...] card, and make sure you stay within the space alloted on the form otherwise the [...] wont go through 
First, the Canon 1Ds Mark II is an awesome professional camera. This review is about the completely misleading Amazon offer of 42% off. This is the biggest joke imaginable. The Amazon website shows the list price as $11,999.99. When Canon launched this camera the MSRP wasn't that high. It was $7,999. Methinks someone with a calculator got carried away. Anyway, after adding it to my cart to see the unbelievable low price it turns out its within about $100 of what every other reputable online shop is selling it for. I expected more from Amazon. This behavior is reprehensible 
The Canon 1Ds Mark II does not list for $11,999. Body only it lists for around $7,500 
i think this is the BEST buy anyone can do, is superfast, flexible (50-3200 asa) interchangeble lenses, long last battery, all excellent, the only bad thing is the high price but it worth it, its like having a ferrari, almost you want to keep it at home in case that something bad happens like being stolen or damaged even do that some people say that the big size is an inconvinencie i personally would not like a tiny camera as a professional photographer it woud look ridicoulous, so the size is a good thing also, when people that even dont know the camera are impressed by the stuff it has 
This camera has the potential for pictures with amazing clarity and colors but not straight out of the camera. I too was disappointed after converting the RAW files with C1 Pro and ACR. Was it possible that my D-Rebel would be better than this monster that gives me neck pains and has made my right arm to start looking like Swartzenegger's arm? Even with L glass the results were dissapointing. The problem is not with the camera but with the workflow. After using it for 2 months I am getting used to a workflow that will give me the results I am looking for. I had to realize that this camera does not perform any processing enhancements in camera because the pros need to do it themselves. Once I got over the fact that I would have to sharpen and saturate colors a lot more than before I was content and have never touched the D-Rebel ever since. PS Beware of the severe neck pains when attaching any L zoom lens. Buy the hand strap or a better neck strap. Some photo samples can be found here: http://www.trekearth.com/members/nbournas/photos 
I have been shooting digital for four years now mostly with the Kodak DCS cameras(660 through DCSPro). Being a life long Nikon guy it was a big decision to make the switch to Canon and the 1DS MK2. This camera is light years ahead of any Kodak digital slr. I use this camera for studio product, models, location, low light, you name it. The Canon has never produced anything but astounding images for me. All image parameters including sharpness are far superior to any of the old images I have from my Kodak days. Yes it is pricey but if you are working with this camera you will pay for easily long before it's useful days are over. 
I purchased this camera online one month ago from amazon here [...] And I have taken pictures from Alaska to Florida and in Washington I love how the Mark II captures images IMHO more clearly than any film SLR could ever take. Best Camera I have every use 
I am a Pro Photographer who formerly used Medium Format. I wanted to get a digital SLR with better than film quality. The EOS 1Ds MK II is it! It is weather/dust resistant (to a point) when combined with Canon's "L" series lenses, and if you own this body, those lenses are a must-have. The controls are easier to master than I first thought. It is fast, no shutter lag and fast write to card. The colors and details in shadow/highlights are amazing! Truly a joy to hold! If you want the best, this is it 
This hood comes with the 70-200 lens and my local shop didn't stock it. They said it was a special order part and that it would take a week for it to come in. I ordered it on a friday, and received it on a Wednesday. Not bad. Thanks Amazon 
This cleaning pen is just as advertised. I have used it on a daily basis since I got it, and it has never failed to do a great job. I use this with the VisibleDust Huricane blower, and the combo is unbeatable. Great value for the price 
Practical and essential for SLR photography. Specially usefull to carry with your equipment 
Lens pens don't do a perfect job, but they do a better job than anything thing else I have found. It is a "must have" product for anyone with a camera! And the Nikon lens pen has worked well for me 
I was skeptical when I ordered the pen because I wasn't too sure how clean it would really keep my lens. Last week I traveled through out Mexico and visited some beautiful places, along with seeing a lot of family members. With all these family members around, a few accidently touched my lenses. I decided it would be a perfect time to test my new pen. End Result? PERFECTION! The lenses looked like thru were brand new! I used to carry little paper whipes designed for lenses, but now I use the Nikon Lens Pen and I don't need to worry about carrying whipes and throwing them away 
I bought this for the convience of keeping my lenses clean durring fast furious wedding shoots. It has worked beautifully. It works great for taking off fingerprints and wiping away dust. 
I bought this pen for my boyfriend for his new Canon Digital Rebel SLR, but you could use it for almost anything with a lens. It's got a small brush on one end to swipe away big stuff, and a round felt tip on the other for cleaning smudges. He finds it very useful and it fits right in hiw camera bag 
When it comes to cleaning my digital camera lenses, i'm very afraid of damaging something, so this little and cheap product takes away all the fear, and all the dust from my lenses. --- Cuando se trata de limpiar los lentes de mi camara, me da mucho miedo que se daï¿½e, entonces con este pequeï¿½o y barato producto, fuera miedo y fuera polvo 
Easy, fast and serius tool, for cleaning your optics. The easy use is discribe in the manual that is very clear to understand. Cleaning is fast with the Nikon lens pen, cuase it has the necesary to do the job well done, as any profesional tool. Now I have 2 of them, for my two camera bags. 
I purchased the Canon Off Camera Shoe Cord to use with the Canon EX 580 for weddings. I needed the cord to use the flash on a braket to avoid red eye. It does what it's supposed to. No complaints. 
Other reviewers have complained about the plastic foot on the flash-bracket end cracking or breaking off. The solution is a metal "sacrificial foot" that screws into the 1/4"-20 threads on the bottom. Bogen/Manfrotto 3298 (BO3298) works perfectly. No Amazon vendor carries it as of this date, but you can find it at bhphotovideo.com. Their listing says it's for Nikon, but it works for the Canon Off Camera Shoe Cord 2 as well 
I got this cord mainly for Macro work so that I could use long Macro lenses along with my flash without having to deal with the lens shadow in the picture. It is also very nice to be able to control the direction of the lighting by placing the flash above, below, or beside the subject. Red eye can also be almost entirely reduced by moving the flash further away from the camera body, so this cord is helpful for portrait work. It could be a little longer, but the longer it gets the more difficult it would be to pack it small spaces, so all-in-all I think they did a pretty good job. It works fine, if you want all of your flash's functionally, but don't want it in the hotshoe, this is a good choice 
This camera cord shoe works well. However, it can break relatively easily so I suggest having two at any given time. Also, the cord length can be too short at times and two long depending on your needs 
There is not much to say about this, since there were no other alternatives for me. Simply stated, I went for the lowest price I could find. 
Only problem is I live in Holland and have to have things sent to my daughter in the US and then forwarded since you don't ship overseas. Any hope that may change in the future 
The Canon 250D and 500D are doublet type close-up lenses which are corrected for chromatic abberation ("achromat"). They offer better performance than the less expensive singlet type lens. I have been happy with the performance of these lenses used on an EF 100mm/2.0, even when used stacked together for higher power (which Canon does not recommend) 
This was my first digital camera that I have ever bought, and I am completely satisfied with it. Talk abt the resolution or the camera's feature. All of it is packed into one small sleek camera. I recommend this digital camera to everybody. And I would say if I would decided later in future to get another one. I would alwayz go for Canon. They are the best in making Digital Cameras 
I needed to replace a lost S4oo we had for about a year. Looked at the SD series and thought them too small for comfort. There is such a thing as too thin to handle comfortably. The S500 is, like the S400, just right in size. Big area on back for thumb so you an even one-hand hold it. Try that with any SD. Pictures are excellent for a hand-held. Not Nikon N70 film SLR good, but plenty good enough for any snapshot purpose. Bought one of last new S500's available at NewEgg abd very, very happy with it 
After owning three other Canon cameras I am through with Canon. All my other cameras were fine. This cameras LCD broke within the first month of normal use. Never dropped! All of my other Digital cameras held up for years. Ive had two powershot s50s 1 lost and 1 stolen. Never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times. This is a product defect/design flaw and Canon will not cover it under warranty. $150.00 to get it repaired and It will happen again, or you may start getting the E18 errors. This is a expensive paperweight! Poor design. Very dissapointed. I will never buy another Canon product again 
This pouch is a Godsend so I bought 2. I use them for my EFS 60-mm and EFS 85-mm Lenses. The base feels firm so the lens sitting inside is protected and won't go anywhere and is made out of a strong naugahide. The pouch itself is thick felt and the rope pulls are made of heavy nylon twine that feels silky in your hand. The whole pouch is well built to protect but can be handled roughly and still protect the contents, your precious lenses 
I used this SB-600 on my Fuji S3 digital camera for a friend's wedding. I found that you do need a diffuser (such as an omni bounce), otherwise you get shadows. And it works great bouncing off the ceiling to fill the whole room. This flash is easy to use, reliable and the batteries didn't die until picture #637. I had no instances of it not going off when I took a picture ever 
This flash preforms with excellence ! All Nikon products I have are of pro grade. This flash recycles fast and is ready when I need the extra light for fill and main light. I purchased the SB-600 for the D-200 and am very happy with it. I have used it for the last six weddings this year and for shooting action shots of skate boarding compitions. R.Wolf, Atl.GA 
I purchased my SB-600 a day before my granddaughter's birthday party at our local skating rink. With very little time to test the unit prior to the party, I dove right in. I was amazed at the exposures from very close shots to, believe it or not, the entire length of the skating rink. The auto-zoom is a really cool feature that changes to match your lense setting from wide to telephoto. I made about a 150 shots the first time out using NiMH batteries with no significant drain. At this time, I have found absolutely no negative points. I may even purchase a couple more and replace my portable Photogenic studio lights 
This flash is unbelievable, most the time I use the built-in filter because it is so powerful, great value for the money. Just takes some practice getting it adjusted correctly as I said before it really throws the light out there. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
I've been quite satisfied with my Nikon D50 and I've been using the built-in flash occasionally to get evenly lit images and balanced exposed shots. But the built-in flash just doesn't cut it. I made the huge mistake of taking pics at my cousin's wedding reception in a huge hall thinking that a tripod, high ISO settings, and the built-in flash will suffice. I was wrong. I borrowed a fellow photographer's spare speedlight (SB-600) and when I downloaded the pics to my computer for some fine tuning, I noticed the HUGE difference between the built-in flash. The speedlight gave me more area to be covered by the flash. For roughly under $200+, this is quite the bargain. I'd recommend rechargeable AA batteries. The recycle time for the flash is FAST. 
Great flash, all the good qualities of the SB800 but less of the data dump and decision quagmire! It has the built in flash disperser, its lighter than the 800, so unless you're into more info than you need, go with the SB600. Oh, it has a shorter recycle time too. 
Well priced and works beautifully. No complaints - does exactly what it said on the tin. 
Finally was able to put some money aside and get a new flash for my D50. I looked at the less expensive Sigma flashes, but in the end I decided to go with the Nikon. I figured I spend the money on the camera, I'm going to get the better flash. Used it the other day and took some great portraits of my daughter. The flash worked like a charm. It is better than the on camera pop-up flash. The pop-up flash comes in handy if you can't or forget to bring the main flash, but it is really nice to have the extra power of the SB-600. If you think your going to do a lot of indoor photography (birthdays, holidays, etc..) this is a great flash. If you have children, the best bet for portrait photos,,, the Nikon D50, Nikkor 50mm 1.8 and the SB-600 flash. Great combination for a very good price. We haven't had to take the kids to have their pictures taken at a studio. With this set-up, you can take great portraits of your kids in their own environment at a more convenient time that you and the kids decide. And no traveling in nice cloths to worry about 
I bought this flash for use on my Nikon D200 and it works better than I had hoped. You can fine tune it for your own personal liking and it has more options than I am currently smart enough to use. But don't worry, you don't have to be a super camera geek to get great results right off the bat. This thing has great "reach" as it actually zooms right along with your lens to pinpoint your subject. It's just audible enough to let you know it's doing that. I'm definitely glad I bought this thing. MUCH better than the small pop-up flash 
This camera looks amazing, not that I will ever have the money for it. I am impressed that this camera was the choice to shoot a feature film! It was used to shoot Tim Burton's Corpse Bride 
I had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the Canon EOS1. As exploration Health, Safety Environment advisor, work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans. The wait was for 35mm film quality, with speed of picture taking (5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the EOS 1 was desired). There was a parallel wait for an Image Stabilised 28-300 zoom lens. Let's cut the story short. If I want a camera to bring on holiday, it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky; instead I would choose the EOS20D without hesitation. But having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames I decided not to wait any longer but to buy the EOS1D Mark II because the 1Ds Mark II is not fast enough at 4 frames a second. With 35mm cameras, after a few seconds on the shooting, I would have to run back inside to the cabin (of a ship) to change film. If there is large enough memory card in the EOS1DII, there is no need. This camera is built with seals against the environment (and so does the 28-300mm lens). Instead of being scared of running out of film, now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning (and hoping) the dolphins do their jumps into the air. With the 28-300mm lens attached, there is no need to change lenses either. Dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting. It is a disappointment that the battery is not LiOn but the older NiMH. But as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare, whatever the substance. I just wish Canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky. It has connections for two batteries (yet it could only charge one following the other) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged. You just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit, binoculars, laptop, mobile phone, GPS.......ext. hard disk....as hand luggage. For work, I am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware. But for holidays, I would choose the EOS20D with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod? The camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down. Why just 4.5 stars ? One of the beauties I had thought with digital SLR was not having to do anything in processing, just transfer the images to the computer. Wrong. The .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough. Post processing is required. Why ? Why is that necessary when the Canon S60 (which I use for different assignments (with underwater housing)) doesn't need to ? That defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 Meg when the 1.5 Meg of the S60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? Still, there is RAW if the standard output is not suficient. Incidentally, the EOS1DsII also produces 5.5 Meg .jpg and those also require post processing. For those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary (me) 16.7 Million Pixels would seem a bit wasted. I am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process, and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film. Meantime I shall have to learn to shoot with RAW files and post process. Also incidentally, the sensor size of the EOS20D is smaller, which means although itself is lighter than the EOS1D series camera, having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday. The magnification ratio for the EOS1DII is 1.3 whereas the EOS20D is 1.6. This means I could still travel reasonably light (compromise) with the 1DII and 28-135mm IS lens attached. Sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious. Any regrets ? None what-so-ever. It is state of the technology at the moment. Another benefit of using digital is that, it doesn't matter if you had been shooting ISO 100 all day. come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop, just change to ISO 1600 without having to bother about "pushing2 the film in developing. It's a beauty when an IS L lens is attached. You'd need IS when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! Good job Canon. Now you need to shoe horn in a more capable CPU (to process the images in-camera), fit the 1DsII sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1DsII and you may persuade me to part with more cash. 
I just upgraded from a 20D, and the speed just blows the 20D out of the way!! Image quality runs about the same for both cameras since they're both 8.2MP, but how the camera gets you those images is simply amazing. Fastest shutter out there, low noise, consistent color, spot metering, multiple spot metering, weather sealing, the list goes on and on!! This camera demands the best glass, but you won't be sorry.  If your serious about photography in any field, this camera won't disappoint!! A bit pricey, but believe me, it's worth every penny!!!! See some of my work at (... 
eos-1d mark II digital this camera i use two months a little hard to use because it has a lot of things. i am not a proffecianal but i liked very much the pictures is the best like any camera i had. 
I'm a recreational photographer, and I love this camera. This is my 7th month with the beast -- since I pre-ordered it early from Amazon by MISTAKE. (Long story) Before buying the 1D Mii, you should know a few things: 1. It's easy to overlook the spec that the camera's USB connection is 1.1 not 2.0. This is 40 times slower, and Canon clearly intended the Mark II to be connected via firewire. That said, I occasionally use it with my laptop on the road, which only has a USB connection. It's convenient that the port is there, but my 1GB CF card takes a good half hour to empty. 2. By the time you've attached a solid L series or comparable lens to this camera, it weighs enough that lugging it around on your shoulder, even without a camera bag full of tricks, is quite a burden. Also, I was talking to a professional photographer who wouldn't buy the model just because cameras this heavy give her wrist trouble. If you've NEVER held a camera this size in your hand, I recommend borrowing one first or checking our your local camera store, even if you do ultimately buy from Amazon. 3. The camera conveniently supports both SD and CF cards. Unfortunately there's no way to copy between the two cards using the camera. It's not a gigantic deal, but there were times I had to wait to get home from a trip to free up the SD card when I didn't have a camera cable, but just an external CF reader. Those are really the only 3 things I wish I'd known before I bought the camera...but would they have affected my purchase? Probably not! As I said, I bought the camera by mistake. Has it been loads of fun? Definitely. I have prints almost as good as medium format - at 100 times the convenience. 
I cannot say enough about this camera! From the moment you pick up the box, you know you have quality. The construction and materials used is top notched. Contents of the box can be found elsewhere, so I won't bother with the details. Charging of the battery to full takes 2hrs. If you have memory on the battery from repeated charges without complete depletion, you can recondition the battery with the included charger. It just takes 8hrs. While many lament the fact that no Li-ion battery was included, Canon seems to have anticipated the needs of professionals in the field. One also has the option of being plugged into the AC outlet and not dependent on batteries. Reading the manual takes a bit of time. The camera has endless customizable functions which can be overwhelming at times. Not that it should deter you, but one will rarely need all those functions anyway. Using the camera did not seem too difficult. Many functions need the use of two buttons, which may take some getting used to. Navigating through the menu was confusing initally, but improved as time goes on. Autofocus speed is responsive and sharp. Shooting at high ISO's (&gt;1000) had minimal noise. Looking at some of my pictures taken with 1 fluorescent light in the room and an ISO of 1600, appeared as if a flash was used. Photos of my black lab was incredible considering the ambient light and high ISO. The camera is always ready to go. If you are in the manipulating within the depths of the menu heirarchy, and want to suddenly take a shot, just press on the shutter button, compose, focus, and shoot. Its quick and responsive. Incredible...! Some may be wondering the sizes of the pictures. JPEG's have 4 sizes and range from 1 - 2.8 MB; RAW files are 8.4MB. One can take an average of 800 - 1200 shots on a full battery charge--assuming one has the capacity to hold it. Prints on my i9900 are outstanding. Cost is a pretty penny and then some. Also consider that Amazon is an authorized Canon reseller. Many of the rebates require that you purchase from an authorized reseller to be eligible for the rebates. Also, some of the internet deals for the camera are not from authorized resellers. Overall, a very impressive camera. The cost for many may be prohibitive for many. The EOS 20D may be a more cost effective alternative, but I do NOT regret my decision one bit 
This tool transforms my DRebel XT's tiny little viewfinder into a usable one. At it's 1.25x setting it shows a clear picture with 100% coverage of what the viewfinder shows. At 2.5x, the coverage is much less but that setting is very handy for very critical manual focussing jobs. Remember to set your camera's diopter to it's default factory setting. Otherwise, flipping the angle finder between 1.25x and 2.5x magnification requires re-adjustment of the finder's diopter. Another big advantage of this little device is that it gives you the freedom to try exciting angles (hey, they don't call it the Angle Finder for nothing) without breaking your neck. The only minor downside is the initial learning curve in getting adjusted to the image shown by the finder. 
This is a great tool for those shots where you want to get down low. Macro work and landscape/waterscape shots near the ground are so much easier with the angle finder on than without. I have also used it when doing portrait work to get a more flattering angle without having to kneel or stoop over the whole time. Now for the negative. It fogs up much easier than the normal eyepiece, which makes seeing anything a challenge under some conditions. And the big one for me, especially with macro work, you loose some light when using the angle finder. So if you are already working in a low-light situation, this only makes matters worse. But in well-lit conditions where fogging is not an issue and you want to shoot low, this is an amazing accessory, thus the 4 out of 5 stars 
Hi Canon lover, It is perfect and professional for users who love to capture excellent image. Do not wait longer buy as soon as you can and you will not lose anything. Keep it up and have a wonderful day with Canon products. Best wishes, Appreciation Canon Product 
This what i discovered when i've used my brand new 1D markIIN Well, I have to say that I am truly impressed with this camera. A friend of mine got his about a month ago, so I have played with it a little bit, but since I got mine on thursday, I have really gotten to explore the many features and performance differences beween this camera and the 20D that I upgraded from. Having used a few original 1D cameras, a 1D mark II, the 20D with battery grip and a 5D, the size and weight of this camera really doesnt bother me (I have heard so many people complain about the size and weight before...) I actually really like the feel of the 1D mark II N. There is only a slight difference between the original 1D Mark II's feel and the N, but if you hold them side by side you notice it. The autofocus is absolutely stunning. Having used a 20D for a year and a half, I had forgotten how nice it is to have those 45 highly sensitive autofocus points! As soon as you pick up this camera and hold that shutter button half way down, you realize why this is the #1 choice of many of the best photojournalists. The body construction is the highest quality I have ever seen in a camera, but of course is very similar, if not identical to the other 1D series cameras. Compared to the 20D and 5D though, this thing just feels solid. Another stunning feature is, of course, the speed at which the 1D Mark II N can capture images... 8.5 frames per second! Just as the 1D and 1D Mark II have done for the past few years, this camera holds its own to all other cameras in its class, with 22 frame raw bursts at 8.5 frames per second. I hardly ever shoot jpeg, but i did test it and found the 48 frame buffer to be quite impressive. Packing two 2 gig Sandisk Ultra II cards (a CF and an SD) I have the capacity for about 450 total shots. The screen, of course, is fantastic, and blows any Nikon camera's menu and image review quality out of the water. The 1.3x crop factor is certainly an improvement over the 20D's 1.6x, and the bigger sensor definitely yields better image quality in low light due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio. Overall, color reproduction, metering, exposure and sharpness are all much better than the 20D. since i love wildlife photography I have been able to get 75% more caption information than I ever did with my pervious cameras The camera performs great in the studio, and images are beautiful, as would be expected. I have yet to make any photographic prints from this camera, but I'm sure they will look stunning. 
This is an excellent camera! I purchased mine in Feb. '06 and have used it continually for 2+ months before I decided to write this review. First, I am an avid amateur photographer, and I wondered if this camera would be worth the expense, for a non-pro. I've found that I do not regret this purchase in any way. I researched it for several months and even bought the Digital Rebel XT first, thinking I'd rather not spend so much for a camera (I like the Rebel XT and it is a fun back up camera)....and I was confused as to which camera to choose. Most official reviewers either did not review it, because there was not "much" difference btw. it and the ID Mark II or simply said that if you wanted to shoot sports or fast action, then the 1D Mark II N was the way to go. I don't shoot those...I'm a wedding/portrait person. However, I do also shoot landscapes and fast moving animals as well and wanted the weather proofing and speed that comes with the Mark II N. So choosing between the 5 D, the (at the time) upcoming 30D and the 1D Mark II N was very difficult. One pro review site said that the Mark II N was a needless upgrade to the Mark II. I found that an odd remark because Canon changed almost everything that they didn't like in the Mark II. You can record both in RAW and JPEG at the same time, on different cards. A 2.5" LCD that can be magnified from any point, to check the sharpness, there is a definite absence of noise in shadowed areas and you do not have to pair this with an L lense to get excellent photos. Aside from my L lenses, I use the 50mm 1.4, the 70-300 DO and the 85mm 1.8 with excellent image quality across the board. I am a small woman and found that the camera's weight takes some time to get used to. However, the camera itself is so fast that it compensated any camera shake I might have had, due to the weight, by it's speed. And, now that I am used to it, I hardly notice it. The multitude of control buttons can be confusing, but if you are used to the 1D Mark II, it's not a difficult switch. If you are used to the Rebel XT, keep the manual handy for your first few times out. Whether you shoot in JPEG or RAW, the photos manipulate well in photoshop and you don't lose any quality (in my opinion) for not having the 12 megapixels of the 5D (which was 1 of only 2 reasons why I considered the 5D). Large enlargments (16x20) print up quite excellently and again, you have the speed to NEVER miss a shot. I've found that in shooting portraits with difficult to shoot subjects (children, pets, someone who DOESN'T want to sit for a portrait but his wife is making him...), SPEED does matter and often it's saved me from a failed shoot! The 1.3x FOV crop factor (vs. the full frame 5D) is definitely a factor to be weighed. Frankly, I use the 17-40L and get excellent landscape photos. As wide (at 22mm) as I could ever wish, and not get "fish-eye". So, I don't find the crop factor to be a personal issue but it was something I had to take into consideration in my choice. While it limits my 24-70L and my 24-105L to only 31.2mm at wide angle, it gives my 70-300 DO IS that "just enough" extra zoom boost (to 390mm) that I don't have to buy yet another expensive lens. I've been trying to think of the negatives of this camera, in order to give a balanced review. As I said, initially the weight was an issue as well as learning the controls. Both were quickly overcome. The cost is definitely a factor, but especially for anyone who does this for a living, it is definitely worth the $. I like everything about this camera (and I've gone through several others to get here). When I don't have it with me, and find myself with my A620 (my "in the purse" emergency camera) I get so frustrated that the A620 won't do anything even close to what I've now come to expect as the standard for all cameras. So I guess that's the one downside, because it's a large SLR, I don't carry it absolutely (though almost!) everywhere. However, overall, unless you want to pay close to $7K for the Ds and the extra megapixels, I don't believe there's a better camera on the market. I realize that while this review doesn't cover all the technical specs (you can get that on either cnet.com or the-digital-picture.com) I hope it helps someone like me who had a really difficult time making the ultimate decision 
The Canon 1D Mk IIN is the bomb. I opted for this camera over the cheaper and higher megapixel camera, the 5D. It is rare that you need more than 8M pixels and the sharpness and speed of this camera is nothing short of amazing especially when comparing to my other digital slr, the Canon 20D. This is a camera that I will enjoy for many year 
Very solid camera, but a bit heavy. Good battery life. It is a very professional camera 
Canon has three digital cameras for $2,500+. The 1DS Mark II, the 1D Mark IIN and the relatively new 5D. I chose Canon over Nikon (which I've shot most of my photographic life) because of Canon's more impressive suite of lenses. Here's the decision process I went through. As with most products, it comes down to how you'll use it. All of them have tradeoffs. 1. Megapixels. More pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged (and cropped more tightly)with less deterioration. The 1DS is the market leader at 16.7MP, the 5D comes in at 12.7MP and the 1D at 8.2MP. If you're a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1DS probably makes sense. If you're a wedding photographer, the 5D is probably the sweet spot. In practice, however, the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people. At 8.2MP, you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond the camera's native resolution. Up to that size, you certainly won't see much difference in prints from the three cameras. That said, the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude. 2. Full frame. The 1DS and 5D are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you're accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera. The 1D and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor (FOVCF). For the 1D, it's 1.3X. What that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor don't capture everying the lens is "seeing" - it crops the view in a little tighter. The result: your lenses are effectively 1.3X longer. A 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on. Because the camera is effectively "cropping" the edges of the image that the lens produces, it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses. Whatever camera you use, what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get, and it doesn't affect the pixel resolution of the image. My 300 mm lens with a 1.4X extender and a 1.3X FOVCF is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory. (If you're switching from film to digital, some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the FOCVF. Your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm.) 3. Durability. This was most important to me, though it may not be for someone who doesn't shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years. Both the 1Ds and 1D sport complete metal bodies, sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200,000 cycles. The 5D - a very solid camera - is designed for 100,000, is not weather sealed and has more plastic components. 4. Weight/size. What a solid, metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight. For those who prefer a camera with heft, these have it. For many people, this is a big drawback. The 1DS and 1D are 43 oz., or almost three pounds for just the body, without the big battery. Add the battery and you're at 54 oz. The 5D is just 29 oz. and 31 oz. with battery. The 1DS and 1D, with built-in vertical grips, are also more than 2 inches taller. If you're looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around, the 5D is it. 5. Speed. There's a reason the 1D is the camera of choice for photojournalists, sports and many bird photographers. It shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second, compared to 4 fps for the 1DS and 3 fps for the 5D. For most day-to-day uses, 3 fps is more than adequate. From using both, I'd say the 1D autofocuses a bit faster, too. The 1D has 45 autofocus points, compared to nine for the 5D. 6. Price. Give or take a hundred here or there, the 1DS is about $7,200; the 1D about $3,900; and the 5D about $3,000. Price will determine whether you get the 1DS or not. If you can afford it, go for it. Otherwise, other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision. What did I decide? First, I looked at how I'd use the camera: photojournalism, travel and wildlife photography. The higher FPS was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed, so either the 1D or 1DS would do. In the end, I decided I'd rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera. (I bought the 300 f/2.8 IS for close to the difference in price.) So, I went with the 1D Mark IIN. If my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife didn't need a new car, I'd probably have gone with the 1DS. I'm VERY happing with the decision and the camera. For most people and most uses - general portrait, landscape and travel photography - the 5D is probably the way to go. (Or perhaps the next greatest camera that Canon will announce later this year. 
With a wicked 8.5 frames per second, this is a sports/action/photojournalists dream camera. If you need the speed this is the one. Aimed squarely at sports shooters and photojournalists, Canon has done it. If you are looking for more of a portrait/art/wedding camera get the Canon 5D 
Can someone make sense of this for me please? """The smaller the maximum aperture, the smaller and lighter the lens.""" WTF? Anyway... it's an affordable range for those of us in the real world to explore. It gets 4 stars for price Vs usability for the Joe Soaps and the Jane Does like me out there 
So this is a great starter lens, it came with my canon body when I got my camera, and I've used it tons. It is light, smooth, fast to focus, and cheap. My only problem was the number of times I found myself stepping back because the 35mm end of the zoom wasn't wide enough. I now carry a 22-55 instead and love that lens (come on Amazon - get it in stock). If you're on a budget then this lens is great. If you can afford the little extra go for the 28-80 instead 
This was my first digital camera. I received it as an anniversary present; My Fiance thankfully has *Great* taste. Anyhow, This particular camera took by far the best photos I have ever seen! The pictures were EXTREMELY crisp. I thought the camera was very user friendly and a lot of fun to use. I used it for 13 months without a single problem. Until it was stolen. :( So now I have decided to upgrade to the Canon SD700. By the way, I have tried out all of my friend's and family's digital cameras just to compare theirs to my canon and not a single one of theirs could compare to the pictures that my canon A520 took... So try it out, you won't be disappointed!!! 
Since this is my first digital camera, I really can't compair it to others out there. However, it does everything I need it to do and has more features than I make use of! I've never had a problem with it 
I have developed a dimple in my right retina that places a blur in the center of my field of view. I am right handed so my right eye is my "sighting eye". this device gives me the clearance to use my left eye to focus and compose my shots. I love it 
These are my experiences with the extender mounted to my EOS 10D. I'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30D, but it looks like I don't want to risk wasting my money. Let me explain: Let me start by saying that the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the LCD screen. I shoot events at nightclubs a lot, so I'm always (a) running around to get shots, causing me to sweat, which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and (b) I always show the subjects their photos after I take them, so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying. For further clarification, I'm Asian, so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities. I run around a lot when I shoot. So the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off. I got lucky once, and found it in the general vicinity of where I was, but the second time, I wasn't so lucky. So what did I do? I purchased another one. Not only did I have to purchase the extender, I had to purchase the viewfinder replacement (the piece with the soft rubber) because that was attached to the lost extender. Another 2 weeks in, and again, same problem. I didn't even bother buying any replacements, as by this time, I upgraded to the 30D. If you don't plan on doing a lot of running around, then this piece may be okay for you. However, please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my Canon Backpack. For some reason, the piece didn't fit tightly with the mount on the camera. Another problem, as most people mentioned, is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender, so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day. I guess I'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30D; I'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10D 
Yep, it extends the eyepiece out a little bit ... which helps those of us with noses not smudge the lcd display ... but it also distorts the view in an annoying way. I use mine on occasion ... but not all the time 
I purchased this extender so that I could be more comfortable looking through the viewfinder. 5/8ths of an inch doesn't seem like a big difference, but it is enough to put some space between your face and the camera.  Having your face pressed against the camera is a good thing, as it helps to stabilize the camera reducing camera shake. However I find the 20D very uncomfortable without the extender. My discomfort comes more from how the eyepiece cushion rests on the eye and not so much from a smashed nose. The extender doesn't prevent the camera from pressing against my nose, although it clearly doesn't press as much. My face still is in contact with the back of the camera. The eyepiece cushion feels more comfortable pressed against the eye with the extender in place. To install, you remove the eyepiece cushion from the camera, slip on the extender and then reattach the eyepiece cushion to the extender. The extender does reduce the magnification in the viewfinder, but not enough to be an issue for me. The extenders can be purchased with your eye glass prescription strength in mind so one doesn't need to wear their glasses when using the camera. This particular extender does not correct vision. This extender stays on my camera at all times. PROS: Gives your nose some breathing room. Adds comfort CONS: Reduces magnification in the viewfinder 
As an eyeglass wearer, I suffered needlessly for years 
My take on this lens is that it is an "L" quality optic in a fine, non "L" package. There is nothing else on the market to compete with it (nothing at all), and it produces supurb images. It isn't an f/2.8 lens, but it is close enough for most uses. The competition from Tamron is a full stop slower, not as sharp, and is awful in dim light compared to the Canon 10-22 lens (sorry, Tamron fans, but the Tamron lens isn't even playing in the same ballpark). I use this lens on a 30D body, and I always keep it on hand if I'm doing any indoor, or tight group photography. It is the perfect solution to the perennial problem of not having enough room to capture all the kids at a birthday party in one shot because your back is up against a wall. This lens will just about get your toes into the picture at the widest setting, yet delivers tack sharp, colorful, and contrasty images. The auto focus is spot on, silent, and fast. It is a must have lens for the active amateur, or any pro using a 1.6 crop factor camera. You simply can't beat this lens with anything available on the market today. That beng said, do not try to convince yourself that this will make a good "walkaround" lens. It isn't. Even at max length, it is far too short to live on your camera as a standard lens. You need this lens, even if you don't know it yet, but it should not be your first lens, as it will only be used 15 to 20 percent of the time. At those times, it's performance simply cannot be equaled by any other zoom lens on a 1.6 crop factor camera. You will be amazed by the quality of this lens. It rivals the performance of modern prime lenses, presents a bright viewfinder image, and delivers the goods in tight situations. This is not a casual assessment, nor a Canon "feel good" moment on my part. I developed my first B contact prints in 1964, in my own darkroom at the age of 9 (my parents were concerned:)), and have been an avid photographer ever since. Small, medium, and large format cameras and lenses have passed through my hands over the years, and Canon has become my favorite small format brand. Still, Canon builds some trash lenses that should be avoided. The 10-22 USM is not one of them :). Before you go out and buy this lens, you should already own the EF-S 17-55mm IS f/2.8 lens. That is the king of 1.6 crop factor standard lenses, and includes the awesome Canon IS feature. It will end up being mounted on your camera 80% of the time, and keep you smiling after every shoot. Get that lens first. Then, get the 10-22mm lens. Then, let your imagination run wild, and plan on serious telephoto lenses for the future. Trust me or not, the two lenses mentioned above will provide you with photographic tools that will astound you. Get them in your kit as soon as you can afford them. A little warning about either lens.... Some here will argue the point, but with either lens, get a GOOD quality UV filter that is multi-coated on both sides, and built extra thin to avoid vignetting at wide lens settings. A good filter will cost a little less than one hundred Dollars, and can cost up to one hundred forty Dollars. The minimum brand would be Hoya Pro 1 multi coated filters, and the ante goes up from there. Everything else is garbage, including the Canon "sharp cut" filter that costs less than fifty bucks. No kidding, no conjecture. If you use cheap filters, you will never see what your lens can really do. Ever. No doubt that many will respond with claims that their twenty Dollar filter works just fine, but they simply don't know any better, and have never used their expensive equipment to it's full potential. It's akin to a Chevy owner passing judgement on a Mercedes Benz. The Chevy might feel real good, but until you own the Mercedes, you just have no clue. Bottom line.... Make sure that the quality of your filters exceed the quality of your lenses. Yes, at a hundred bucks a pop for a 77mm filter, it hurts, but you will never regret it. Also, Amazon does not stock lens hoods for all non L Canon lenses. The price is stupid high for those hoods, but they make a night and day difference in in picture quality. Whenever you order a non L Canon lens, find a web seller who has the hood in stock, and get it right now. Again, you will never regret owning it. That's it for my review/rant. Buy this lens. Buy the 17-55 IS f/2,8 first. Buy the lens hoods for both. Toss any "kit" lenses that came with the camera in the trash bin (where they belong), and be very happy. 
This is a great lens for any user, professional or amateur. This lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results. A slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm (16mm cropped) but this is easily correctable with software. In addition, the very fast and absolutely silent USM is a huge plus. I highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door/architecture shots (especially realtors) 
Technical details on this lens can be found in abundance elsewhere, so I'll leave that to the experts and simply say: This is my favorite lens. I love this lens SO much. I have half a dozen other medium to high-end lenses, and this is the one I keep on the camera 90% of the time 
Many great things have already been said about this lens, and I will support them! My copy delivers outstanding sharpness (nearly on par with my 24-70L) even *wide open* (rare for a wide angle of all but the finest German manufacturers), great color, very little distortion (many objective tests have revealed that it's probably the "best of breed" ultra wide angle), and impressive contrast. Surprisingly, the build quality is not bad: tight fitting mount, damped rings, and no jiggles or rattles. If I were forced to offer a (slight) negative, it would be the bokeh of the lens is somewhat "marbly"...However, when shooting a subject with an OOF area differential high enough to make bokeh a component of the frame, then the subject is likely going to demand far more attention than the bokeh! ;) A fine lens, Canon: definitely worth the premium over the Sigma and Tokina rivals (both of which I sampled before purchasing this optic) 
I had the Tokina 12-24 f4 and it was a great sharp lens. This Canon focuses faster and is wider. If you're worried about full frame in the future don't be. Just buy this lens and enjoy the ultra wide images. It light, fast and sharp. "L" quality pictures. The build could be better but I don't see any problems down the road. 
The Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM SLR Lens for Canon EF-S SLRs (like the 20D and 30D) is a good all round lens though it can be soft at 10mm. It only works with EF-S compatable cameras which presently have 1.6x multipliers so the lens is effectively a 16mm to 35mm. If you need to shoot in cramped spaces, or you shoot lots of interiors and you need a wide angle, and have an EF-S SLR this lens is required equipment 
I highly recommend this super wide angle lens for anyone wanting to take landscape pictures, buildings or lots of other stuff! It is so different than the standard kit lens (18-55). You won't be sorry when you start learning all the possibilities of the extraordinary lens 
When digital cameras first came out, I, like many people swore I'd always be loyal to film. Digital could never take the place of film. I'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely. There's still something I love about putting a roll of film in the camera, shooting away, sending the film to be processed, and seeing the results. I also know it's a bit expensive. I know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion, but digital cameras are improving in this regard, and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving, we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital SLR and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera. So I figured now is the time to get a digital SLR. I have been a loyal Nikon user for nearly ten years, and have owned the Nikon N60, N70, and N80. My first love was, and still is the N70 (I've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought I was the only person who loved the N70). I purchased the N80 only after my N70 cost too much to repair, but I've enjoyed the way my various Nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if I don't have the time to use specific controls, but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes. My Nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes, wildlife shots and all sorts of other things I can't resist to capture forever. I decided to purchase the D70 since it was close to what I've already experienced with Nikon. In many ways it works in a similar way to the N70 and 80, except it's a digital rather than film version. Like the film versions of the midrange Nikon SLR's, it has a dial that allows an automatic setting, portrait, landscape, sports, close-up, nightscape, and night portrait modes, the ability to select aperture, shutter speed or manual controls. The camera has auto and manual focus abilities. Photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires. The controls are easy to use, though it takes practice to be comfortable. On a personal level, the camera has passed the Halloween test, niece's birthday test, and fall foliage in New England test and favorite scenic spots test. The only real difficulty I've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting. Auto focus has not worked at all and I'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots, but at this point I'm sure it's the photographer and not the camera. I do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera. The manual is very confusing. It uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else. I've had luck with the "Magic Lantern Guides" with my other cameras, but have not as of yet used it for this camera. I did purchase the NIKON D70 FIELD GUIDE (David Busch, Wiley Publishing) which has been helpful. It can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with Nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography. 
I've had my D70s for about a year now, haven't regretted it for a second. The controls are laid out logically, with everything to hand. The dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate. I personally love the optional grid overlay, I have no excuses for horizons that aren't horizontal. The wireless flash system is great, though you have to buy an SB-600 or SB-800 to get the full benefit. This camera is bigger and heavier than the D50 and D80, which in my opinion is a positive thing. 
I do weddings, portrait, and outdoor photography and I don't see any reason why I'd ever switch from the D70 (other than the D80 :). This camera is professional grade at the consumer price point. Don't be scared by the 6.1 MP. I print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems. I'd recommend reading Thom Hogans manual 
The D70s is a minor update of the original D70 introduced in 2004, with a few new features and a slightly larger LCD. It's still a great camera, but expect it to be replaced by the new D80, which has 40 percent more pixels, a 2.5-inch LCD, and additional useful features at the old price of the D70s. So, you can probably save a little money and still purchase a sophisticated digital SLR if you wait until prices of the D70s stabilize at a new, lower level. At, say, $600, this camera would be an incredible bargain. The D70s has shined as one of the best cameras in its class since its introduction. For example, it has a 1/500th second flash synch speed (found in no other camera but the D50) so you can keep ambient light under control and avoid ghost images. Its autofocus is fast and accurate, and features both single-autofocus, continuous-autofocus (for tracking action), and a novel "automatic" autofocus mode that switches between AF-S and AF-C as required. If you have no Nikon lenses, get this camera with the 18-70mm kit lens, which is very sharp and versatile, rather than the more limited 18-55 lens. You won't regret it 
It has a learning curve, that's for sure, but WOW! This camera is worht every penny, far more stable then the comparable Canon Rebel, and the product comes with better lenses. The quality of glass DOES matter 
This is a quality piece and can take good close-up pictures of still objects. I was looking for something to capture moving/flying insects, this is not what I needed. My fault not the lense. 
I'm looking for a closeup lens for my Canon EOS Rebel XT. But before buying I wish I can see some pictures taken using this lens 
This lens does ok at magnifying about 2x max. On full zoom, the magnification was not as sharp as without the close-up lens 
This is an excellent add-on close-up lens, not to be confused with the relatively inexpensive 1-2-4 sets sold as aftermarket accessories. This is a double-element achromatic (color-corrected) lens made by Canon and recommended for lenses in the range of 50-135mm focal length. It is very sharp and clear with no color fringing. The "250" indicates the maximum distance to the subject is about 250mm with the main lens focussed at infinity. The actual lens power is about 4.0 diopters (+4). It has a 58mm outer thread so you can add a clear filter (UV or Skylight) to protect the lens surface. I am using it with a Canon A620 and the required adapter, and it produces outstanding pictures with excellent detail and sharpness. 
I bought the 250D lens to use with my Sony DSC-F717 and it is just wonderful. I can also use it with my Canon G3 because I bought a Canon LADC58B Conversion Lens Adapter (which is required and is inexpensive). I had been hearing a lot of good things about this lens in digital photography forums and I have seen many wonderful examples of its use. I recommend this lens to anyone who wants to make their "macro" photography shine. Get one! Just be clear that there is the 52mm and the 58mm and don't be confused as to which one will fit your camera. Edit: Just a clarification: This one 'is' the "58mm" even though above (on this page) when you click the links "See More Technical Details" and "See all Product Description" it mentions "52mm". This is misleading and confusing. At the very very top of this page it says "58mm". Let me just assure you that this particular one 'is' the "58mm" and 'is not' the "52mm". late edit (Aug 04, 06): Well, it looks as if Amazon finally corrected that misleading info I mentioned just above in my clarification 
Don't be disappointed because this isn't a lithium ion battery. This battery kicks butt!! It lasted me 3 days of non stop shooting. I started to think that the battery was never going to die! Of course reality set in and had to eventually charge it, but it lasted forever!! The only drawback is that it takes about 2 hours to charge:( Other than that, it will lasts you all day and night 
This is just a plain sweetheart of a lens. It covers the useful 18-35 mm range (which is 27-52mm on a Nikon digital SLR, which is a VERY useful range). This lens costs less than half the price of the (expensive) professional Nikon 17-35, and does almost as nice a job. Sufficiently nice, in fact, that most amateurs will not discern much, if any, difference. While not built like a tank, I think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent, and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros. On a Nikon digital SLR, which will use the center portion of this lens (due to the size of the sensor in the SLR) you can expect excellent, even spectacular results. This is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots, portraits, or just plain walking around taking pictures. Someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent, versatile lens. This one is great for parties, vacations, and the works. The images I have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast, are very sharp, and have beautiful color rendition. There just is not a lot not to like about this lens. I give it 4 stars for overall performance, but 5 stars for value and price/performance. Some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers. This is one of those 
I got this lens to go wider on a 20D. I wanted to go wider so I got a 5D. Started shooting events with this lens and I learned that the 580ex couldn't give me enough light in the dark. Used the lens during the day. Terrible problems with lensflare. The hood showed up on the edges of pictures (wide). Went back to the 24-70L as my primary lens. When this lens works and circumstances are right, the results are stunning. I'm trying to use two flashes to get the power to use it at night, again terrible flare problems. Whenever it matters I have to go back to the 24-70L. I just don't have all these problems with it. The problems with the 16-35 lens appear at the wide end. At 35 the lens operates well but that's not what I bought the lens for. I love the lens but it's the lens that gives me the most frustration and worry. Wish it had cost less but what can you do 
I got this lens because I didn't really own anything close to this range except for the kit lens (good but not great and not f/2.8). I do own a 15mm Canon Fisheye but it does distort quite a bit even on the 20D and I don't like to have to correct in Photoshop each time and I wanted a wide lens. I wanted something wider, that could capture lots of light (I do allot of ambient and low light photowork) and I wanted something versatile (on a 20D this is really a 24mm to 56mm --- great working range). Pros: 1) With the 1.6x crop factor of my 20D this is really a 24 to 56mm lens. This makes it quite a bit less of a wide angle and more of a midrange lens. Consequently, it stays on my camera all the time and covers most of my daily needs. I bought this lens fully expecting it to be 24 to 56 as I wanted it to be multi purpose and at 24mm its still pretty wide. 2) I try to avoid flash as much as possible given the type of photography I do and at f/2.8 I can take some great ambient light pictures that I would not be able to do otherwise 3) At f/2.8, I can also blow the backgrounds and foregrounds out of focus. The out of focus areas are gorgeously buttery and the blokeh is very nice given the 7 blades of the shutter. 4) The color saturation is like nothing I've ever seen before except with my 70-200mm Canon "L". I was literally floored at some baby pictures I took where the colors were in two words "mind blowing". I knew the color would be great but "WOW!" With Photoshop CS2 I can "fake" saturation but its just not quite the same as the color that came out of this lens straight out of the box. Zero photoshop touchup needed. 5) Its sharp! This lens takes some amazingly sharp pictures into what I would classify as amazing. I've received numerous positive comments on the sharpness of this lens. I've tried looking at the edges to see if there's any CA or less sharpness and couldn't really find any. Maybe on a full size sensor you can tell more but I couldn't really on a 20D. I do notice that the plane of focus at f/2.8 is narrow (which is good) and I have to make sure that everything I want in focus is. The blokeh is very buttery at f/2.8. I like it quite a bit. 6) Its built like a tank. Black metal shell. Metal EF mount. Smooth manual focusing. Sturdy recessed switches. The red stripe catches the eye of photographers who know....easy to strike up conversations and learn. 7) It was surprisingly smaller and lighter than I thought it would be. About half the size of my 70-200mm Canon "L". I was expecting it to be bigger and am much happier that it wasn't. Its on my camera all the time and not a chore to carry around at all. Unless you're a very petite person. 8) Internal focusing. So the lens size doesn't change in size or turn when focusing. This is very useful when you put filters on or when you're focusing in close. 9) USM Motor. Its whisper quiet and it focuses super fast. Faster than my 70-200mm....something I'd expect but wow its fast and silent. 10) It focuses pretty close 12 inches or so. You can get close to your subject. Its not a macro lens but you can get some dramatic wide angle shots with its close focusing. 11) Its TTL2 so works very nice with my 580EX flash. 12) EF mount will grow with you. If you upgrade your camera body to a full frame camera with an EF mount, this lens will fit your new camera and you can continue to enjoy your lens investment. Cons: 1) On a 1.6x frame size, it doesn't get into "amazing" wide category but that's not the fault of the lens. I'm marking this down as a Con but you can take it several ways. If you want to get ultra-wide on a small frame camera, you won't with this lens (although 24mm is pretty darn wide) and about your only Canon options are the 15mm fisheye which I own and think is a great specialty lens, the 10-22mm EFS Canon, and the 14mm L. The 10-22 I hear is very good but its EFS (and won't fit the full frame cameras - less upgradable I think) and its not an L lens although for a non-L the 10-22 I hear is exceptional. The 14mm EF L will run you almost as much as this 16-35mm zoom. The 15mm EF Fisheye is wonderful but it is designed to distort and the distortion is visible on the 20D and even more so on full frame cameras and you need Photoshop to fix. On this 16-35mm L, if you want the f/2.8 and are ok with something like 24-56, then you won't find better for small-sensor cameras. I'm very glad I got it and, if you already have a full frame camera or upgrade at some point, you can enjoy 16mm "WOW" wide. I can only imagine the coverage I'd get on a full frame camera. 2) The hood is massive...wide but not very deep...so its a shallow hood (It has to be with the wide angle I guess). I never take it off -- it keeps stray light out and is a secondary protection for the lens. I have had zero problems with lens flare. 3) The front lens element does sink in and out inside the tube (exposed but the lens case doesn't change in size). There is no protective filter to protect that front element. I bought a UV/Haze filter ($26 from Amazon) and I highly recommend you do as well to protect your investment. With the UV/Haze filter, the lens is very self contained. 4) Oh the cost....my oh my. Expensive as heck. Cost as much as my camera body --- worth every penny. If its any consolation, these lenses are very hard to make and they keep their value. Your camera body might drop in value as new technology arrives but this lens will hold its value if you take care of it. Differences, Notes, Things I've heard: 1) I have no experience with non canon lenses so I can't compare but this 16-35 is amazing. 2) Compared to other "L" lenses, it holds up and the quality is amazing when it comes to color, performance, lens construction. 3) I hear there is some Chromatic Aberation at the edges of these wide lenses (well more than the 70-200mm) but that's to be expected when you're gathering light from such wide angles and focusing it....that's got to be hard. Wide angles exhibit more CA than long telephotos. On my 16-35mm it wasn't visible to me. I imagine a Pro's pro might notice care. Anybody with less stringent requirements than a Pro's pro or extremely saavy person, couldn't even notice or care. Besides, CA on this lens is orders of magnitude less than almost any other lens. 4) I bought directly from Amazon. Ordered on a Monday got the lens the next day on Tuesday. Amazing service. Great store. 
I shoot with a Canon 20D and have used the Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM lens as my wide angle option. When preparing for an extended stay in Budapest, I decided it was time to invest in a faster, better quality WA lens. I reviewed the lens lineup at the Canon website and decided on the Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L. As an L lens owner, I was confident this lens would be a great addition to my lens lineup. Being an L lens, this is a serious lens meant for serious photographers. The sturdy construction consists of three aspherical elements and Canon's UD glass which largely eliminate the secondary spectrum. Weather-resistant construction at lens mount, zoom focus rings and switch panel helps protect the lens from the elements. This lens is not compatible with the 1.4x II and 2x II extenders. The Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L lens weighs in at about 1.3 lbs/600g, and accepts 77mm filters or holds gel filters. Be sure to get a good quality UV haze filter to protect the front lens element. Not only do I see this as a good practice, Canon recommends doing so on their site as well. The focus type is the standard twist zoom, and permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. In addition, the lens has a USM drive mechanism for optimum AF performance. Included with this lens are the front and rear lens caps, lens hood, soft storage case, and a US one year warranty. The case is a pull string soft case (LZ1319) that can also be purchased separately. The lens hood (EW-83E) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations. I have to admit I was disappointed by this lens while in Budapest. I found that for wide angle scenes with the focused subject at a distance, the images were soft. This is precisely the type of images I wanted to use this lens for. Just because this is a fast lens, it doesn't mean I shoot everything at f/2.8 either as some may claim. I have a good understanding of exposure and know how to use the aperture setting to my advantage. It didn't matter what aperture I used, distant subjects were soft in my eyes. I wondered if the lens needed adjusting or calibrating after hearing all the great things people say. I lent the lens to a friend who loved the quality and sharpness while taking close up shots. I then began to wonder if I was doing something wrong. After testing the lens, I've concluded that this is not the lens for distant wide angle shots like suggested on the Canon website. When the subject matter is much closer, like the other side of a room or several feet away, this is an awesomely sharp lens.  The Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L lens is too different to compare to the Canon EF 28-135mm. The clarity and sharpness is incredible on close-up shots, and the auto-focus is quiet and quick. Even though this lens didn't fit my original purpose, it has found a place in my lens collection. I don't foresee this lens being one of my most used options though. The Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L comes at a price, but it is worth every penny when used for its strengths. PROS: Incredible clarity and sharpness on close-up shots Quiet and quick auto-focus CONS: Heavy and bulky (This should be expected with these types of lenses) Distant subjects come out soft 
Well, besides a whole bucket full of money, one of them lets you take photos in lower light, okay, that's obvious. The 16-35mm is a bit heavier, but not so you'd notice, unless maybe you were carrying it around all day, without eating and you're a bit over the hill. So why pay the extra money, unless, of course, you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening? Maybe you shouldn't, because I've been doing a lot of photo taking with both, film and digital, and as one would expect from the "L" lenses, the photos are crisp and sharp. In fact I keep I the 17-40 on the camera I carry around all day, you know, the one I might leave on the table in a restaurant when I got to the restroom. It's a lot less money to lose to someone looking for a five finger discount. However, my gal pal Sara and I take a lot of early morning photos. She shoots old houses, and she never, ever goes out without the 16-35mm. She swears by it, loves it, sometimes I think better than me. So there is a difference, I'm the kind of person that could happily live with less expensive lense, Sara is not. However they both deliver gorgeous photos. You can't go wrong if the lense has that red circle around it. Jack Priest, Sailor Home from the Se 
Having received some Christmas cash, I put it to good use with the purchase of this lens. It works great with my Digital Rebel and certainly is a fine choice for any of the EOS Canons. Sure, it is pricey and a little heavy, but if you want a fast, wide-angle zoom lens, there is little else that is equivalent. The zoom range takes you from wide scenics to excellent indoor flash shots at 35mm (with a Canon Speedlite EX accessory). The USM focusing motor is quiet and very quick. Comes with a Canon lens hood. Don't forget to add a 77mm UV filter to protect the optics full time! 
We dedicated a thumb drive to use with the digital photo frame that we download our digital pictures to from a computer. Then we simply plug the thumb drive into the USB port of the digital photo frame and follow the menu instructions to select the USB port thumb drive by pushing a couple of buttons on the digital photo frame. The slide show of the pictures we view from approximately ten feet away have very good resolution. It's great for family gatherings and have received many positive comments from our guests. 
This item shows all of your digital photos in bright, vivid colors. Set up a slide show and play directly from a memory card. The frame is light, portable and easy to use. A great companion for your digital camera and is an excellent way to show off your pictures to friends and family. Just pop in the memory card from your digital camera and your ready to show off all of your precious memories. Features * Bright 5.6" Active Color Screen * Auto Start Slide show function * Supports Photos up to 12M pixels * Includes AC Adapter and Quick Start Guide * No Computer Required, plays directly from memory cards * Brilliant Color Display with adjustable contrast and brightness * Automatic Slide show, Full-Screen Browse, and Thumbnail Browse Display modes * Compatible with major memory cards (CF/SD/MD/MMC and MemoryStick 
Excellent product. Easy to get it started. Great features, clear pictures. Everyone that sees it wants it 
The Digital Photo Frame was easy to use and the software was excellent. I gave the item as a 50th birthday gift and set it up at a very large party. The frame showed a slide show of about 65 pictures and became a focal point for the guests. Everyone spent time looking at the pictures of the family from throughout the 50 years. Many asked where to get the frame. It was a hit and it worked as described 
The picture quality is better than I expected. You still can't see the picture from the sides, but straight on it's good. The interface to load my pictures was very simple. I would like to have a few more options available, but for simplicity purposes, it works great 
I almost didn't buy this camera simply because of the plastic body (I'm used to a Praktica MTL3 film camera, which is built like a tank). However, I'm glad I overlooked that because the camera is top-notch in terms of robust features and the quality it provides. Startup time is very quick and making adjustments to shutter speed and aperture is intuitive. If you get the bundle with the kit lens, I highly recommend complimenting it with the very affordable Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens, especially if you are a big fan of DOF and do a lot of available-light / low-light photography. 
I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camera, its beyond description... 
This Camera is excellent one!! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category, I'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles.. Highly recommended 
I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin. I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working. The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory. The photos, however, are wonderful. Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable. (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos. 
It is extremely easy to use. Hard to figure out the menu, but once that is done there is no problem. Takes beautiful pictures. Great for action shots as well. Seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in 
When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery. They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes. Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice. So I said no. So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots. Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase. Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button. So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine. as for the quality of photos.....i love them 
I'm really impressed, I bought the SD-110 a year ago as a quick small digital for trips. I was never planning to take it diving. The housing is really impressive, I've done 4 dives in the month I have had the waterproof case (WP-DC10) and it works great. I was so excited to try it out I went in the water with a full memory card. I got down to about 35ft and took my first picture and "Memory card full". It was easy to navigate all the buttons and I was able to delete while following my buddy. Taking pictures of fast moving fish doesn't work out and the range of the flash is 1-3ft. My deepest dive so far was 109ft off the Monterey coast, and I worked as if it were in 10ft of water 
If you swim in the ocean, lake, or just like to be around water and want to take pictures, this is the thing to have, it's worth every penny!! The only thing you can't do when it is in the case is upload pictures to your computer, change out memory cards and charge the battery. It is truly amazing. I've had my eye on this for a very long time and with a cruise coming up I knew I had to get it. I'm a snorkeling enthusist and this is definatly the thing to have. Instead of those silly disposable cameras that limit you to only 27 pictures, and you haven't got a clue of exactly what you've taken a picture of, you can take as many as your memory card will allow you. There is also a filter for the flash you can slide into place to help dispurse the light to get that ideal picture underwater! 
I bought the SD110 camera, and since I live in Hawaii, I HAD to have the underwater housing for it. This housing is great, because it allows you to use all the function buttons while the camera is protected in the housing. You can power up the camera, shoot, zoom, change modes and do everything but change the battery, change the memory card and upload your pics onto a computer while the camera is sealed up. I was able to take lots and lots of underwater and surf pictures and movies with this camera. And I was very happy with the results. I treat my gear pretty rough, I was in the water almost every day, not cleaning it all the time and although the housing did get scratched and a little banged up, it still worked great, and it didn't affect the quality of my photos. Then one day while rescuing a swimmer in distress, the camera was knocked off my kayak into the ocean. I went back a few minutes later to search for it. But was unable to find it....I was really bummed. Four months later, a friend of a friend is diving in the same area that I lost the camera, and saw something wedged in the reef, encrusted with coral and alge. He pulled it out and took it back up on the boat-it was a digital camera in the housing. When he opened up the housing and took out the camera.....it powered right up !!!! So he took a few shots on the boat and then took the camera home. He showed it to his friend, and they flipped through the pictures as he told him the story of finding it. One of the pictures that I had taken on the day I lost it, was an underwater self portrait. When my friend saw that: he knew who's camera it was !!! So he calls me...and tells me the story. I was amazed. We figured that the camera and housing had been lying on the bottom for four months in over twenty feet of water, and there had been a few storms that had produced some very large surf in that area, so it had likely taken a beating. But it still maintained its water tight integrity. We were all very amazed at how durable it turned out to be !! I had already replaced the camera with the Canon S500 and it's dedicated housing (mostly so I could get higher resolution photos). After uploading the photos onto my computer, I let the guy who found it keep it. He has cleaned up the housing, and it stays still water tight, the only thing wrong with it (besides a little surface crud on the exterior of the casing), is that a few of the buttons are jammed and so they do not work (the zoom, shutter and power buttons are fine). But not bad at all for a camera that had been on the bottom of the ocean for several months 
Having recently picked up the hobby of digital photography I was not aware of the nuances and the importance of some of the accessories. Back in "the day" when shooting 35mm film I could barely afford the cost of processing - let alone what I thought were fancy accessories. Well - some reading and a trip to Alaska with my Canon Digital Rebel XT - I learned, and appreciate, the importance of a lens hood. I bought a rubber lens hood (not lens specific) at a local camera store that was totally unacceptable - then bought the lens hood for my Canon lens from Amazon. It works great - no flare - no vignetting - and it makes the lens look pretty cool too! I would suggest having a hood for all your lenses and never shooting without - along with the obvious - it saves the front of the lens from bumping damage which is important with longer lenses or tight quarters like shooting on a photo excursion boat full of other people all jockeying for a shot! Amazon service and prices - as usual - were fantastic and although I HATE to wait for things - I am usually happy I do when I order from here. Happy snapping!! 
The lens hood performs as it should by limiting stray light but it is a little sloppy and comes off easily if bumped. It is easy to attach and reverses quickly for easy storage. Pretty much a no brainer but for the money I'd like a little better fit 
Easily snaps in place and does the job. Considerably less expensive than the local retail outlet - and delivery was quick as well 
Nice hood. It's designed for the Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens and therefore does what it's supposed to. 
when the hood is reversed on the lens, it blocks the zoom ring tremendously when at 17mm's. it's not the end of the world, but you're probably better off storing this in a bag, and not on the lens itself when not in use 
The 10D is an outstanding digital camera. I have been using both of mine for over a year now and they have done everything I needed, when I needed it, wthout a single flaw. I really use the 10D. I have taken over 30,000 pictures with it. I use the optional 2 battery Bg-Ed on the 10D which gives me an easy 400 pictures. The 17-40 Canon Zoom Lens has worked spotlessly as well. Pictures are crisp. Easy manual focus and the auto focus works well even in low light. I like the solid feel of the 10D, especially with the 2 battery pack, and 550EX flash. I shoot exclusively on manual mode so I can't comment on the other settings. Adjusting the flash output, ISO etc are all easy and quick. I have found this to be a very intuitive camera. The viewing screen on the back of the camera is clear and gives me good feedback for adjusting my flashes or hot lights. I use Lexar 1GB CompactFlash cards. And I carry an Epson P-2000 Multimedia Storage Viewer for my back up. The only drawback that I have found has been with a couple of my women friends who have found it a bit heavy. I have not only gotten use to its weight but have come to really appreciate the "feel" of the camera. I can tell you that I will NEVER use film again. With an Epson Photo 2200 printer, iPhoto and my own digital darkroom thanks to Photoshop CS I have everything I need right here at home. For downloading the pictures to my MacIntosh G4 or Powerbook I use a firewire SanDisk Reader. It too works perfectly. So if you don't need the increased megapixal of the 20D I would suggest you consider the 10D. One great camera. 
The controls are a little complicated to get used to, especially the all-manual settings -- which should by definition be easy to use -- but overall this camera is very rugged and very capable. After I bought it, I took the D10 to Budapest, Hungary. I had a great view of the Danube and set my camera up for night shots. It did a brilliant job. How about this: take a digital night shot (use the largest image size possible), use a 300mm lense and blow the results up to 24x30 through Shutterfly.com. Image remained amazingly sharp. Colors were fantastic. The camera made it easy to look like a pro. The only gripe I have with this camera is that I wish it had a black and white setting like other less expensive Canon digitals, but this can be overcome with software so it's not a huge issue. The price is great, it has a magnesium body (vs. the Rebel's plastic body). You get a lot of the D1/D20/D30, without the cost 
Since there are tons of rave reviews about the features of this camera, I won't bother you with the details. Instead, I will tell you about the one HUGE letdown of this camera and the likes (Rebel, 20D): the 1.6x focal length factor. This means my dear 28-105 lens is now a sorry 45-170. To recoup the loss I'd have to spend $700 on a 17-40 4.0 lens. This is a consequence of using a small CCD. Cameras like the 1D with full-size 35mm CCD sell for over $4,000. I cannot wait for that price to go down. I also cannot help to wonder whether the focal reading of the Speedlite flashes will be correct (I own a 540EZ and discovered with dismay that it doesn't work in these cameras). I look at my A2 (still infatuated with it) and I wonder if I did the right thing. I think I will keep it around for a while, just in case.. 
This is one of the four cameras, the only digital camera, I used to learn portrait photography. The class was on how to take portraits not how to use the camera. I wanted to graduate from the point and shoot but had to consider my budget because I wanted an SLR film camera also. I got the Canon Rebel Ti packed with two lenses. It made sense to me to purchase a Canon digital to interchange lenses. My original choice was the Canon Digital Rebel, however, in my WEB search, I found the EOS 10D for $750 with no catch. There were no required additional purchases scam when I called. This allowed me to spend the extra money I would have spent on the camera on accessories. Since it's digital, I am not shy about trying out the features. When I first got the camera, some of the photos were dark or very light. After tinkering around and learning what the sensor-indicators means I don't get that anymore. The 10D is more camera than I need that I'm sure I will have it for a long time. 
I've used the Canon EOS 10D for 5 months now and I'm absolutely thrilled with it. The EOS cameras are extremely comfortable to hold and handle. In auto mode, the camera produces correctly exposed, sharp photos. Unlike my Canon Powershot, the camera takes the picture with very little delay after depressing the shutter button. In the creative zones, you can set aperture priority to take, for example, selective focus shots, or use shutter speed priority and set a slow shutter speed to take some good blurring shots. The auto focus is quick and accurate, though how much of that is the camera and how much is the lens I do not know. I never use the manual focus mode. The pop-up flash works great for lighting subject that are in shadows or back lit. I now find it a bit frustrating to use my film camera; I'm addicted to viewing my shots on the spot. I have a Canon EOS A2 film camera that I purchased in 1995. Since I'm familiar with the EOS system and have Canon system lenses, I chose the 10D over the similarly priced Nikon prosumer digital camera. I like my Canon cameras so well that I bought the Canon digital Elf for my sister and the Canon Powershot A80 for my mother. Both have reportedly been excellent cameras. With the 10D, I've used a Canon 50mm/compact macro, a Tamron 28-200mm and a Canon 15mm fisheye lens. Because of the difference in the way a film camera and this digital camera operate, you multiply the focal length of the lens by 1.6 to figure the effective focal length when used with a digital camera. So, for example, the 15mm fisheye lens is effectively a 24mm lens on the 10D. I bought a 1 gig IMB microdrive storage card and that allows me to take 400 high res jpg or about 160 raw format files. If you shoot in auto mode, the camera will only capture in jpg format. If you shoot in manual mode, you can select jpg or raw format. If shooting raw format, ensure you have a software program, such as Photoshop CS, that will open raw files. And know that not all developing and printing shops will accept raw format. But many of the image libraries will ONLY accept raw files (or a high resolution tif scanned from a slide). With the raw format files, I've found that many of my shots require a bit of exposure adjustment, but this is simply a matter of moving a slider bar in Photoshop CS. When you first open a raw file, you get an adjustment window allowing you to play with exposure, tint, saturation, white balance and more. You can even simulate warmup filters and such. Very cool stuff! I bought an extra battery to take along on trips. One battery typically lasts me for 2 days of shooting, as long as I don't do much reviewing of my shots through the camera monitor. Unless you need the quality of the 1Ds immediately I would recommend getting the 10D because technology is moving so fast that the quality of the 1Ds will be available for the current price of the 10D in the near future 
This camera is everything I desired in a digital camera and so much more. While other kids played baseball and football I grew up with a Pentax MX strapped around my neck. Photography was and is my passion. This camera allows me the expression I always dreamed of. Combined with Adobe Photoshop, this is the best camera/darkroom setup I've ever worked with 
I had this camera for years before it was stolen and I replaced it with a digital Canon SLR. I am still amazed at the abuse I put my Rebel 2000 through. It has a nice light body, a great auto feature, and easy-enough to use manual functions. And because of the popularity (and rightly so) of digital these days, you can pick one up for a fantastic price, even brand spanking new 
I have had this camera for about 4 yrs now - I take it on all my business travels. Whenever I get a chance to go out on on the weekends, I take this camera and my Sony camcorder in my backpack, roam the streets of the new city and shoot pictures. The pictures that I shoot from this camera are just awesome - no matter whatever experiment I do with it. Most useful features: 1. Aperture control with Depth of field preview - Lets to focus the foreground and blur the background 2. Shutter speed control upto infinity - Lets you control the amount of time for which the shutter can be kept open 3. It is pretty rugged, dont try dropping it :) I have used it to shoot pics from 'Maid of the mist' in Niagara falls and I almost thought that I was going to lose it. But it worked liked a charm Negatives - Bulky, but you will get used to it, it always gets attention - Cost of developing film - What I do these days is to just get the photos on a CD, then develop only those photographs that are good. Why is this camera better than a Digital Camera ? - If you are spending $200 on a Digital Camera, I feel that the SLR is way far too ahead of any Digital camera in that price range - If you are spending $1000 on a Digital Camera, a Digital SLRs are very mature today - worth buying. Ideally, I would buy this SLR, take this whenever I really want to take good photographs, then I would also want to have a $100 Kodak Digital Camera for casual shots. This would mean an ideal combination. If you are buying this SLR, you can also consider buying a Film/Photo scanners (available for less than $150 now) - which lets you scan the negatives/positives without even going for a cheap CD print. From the reviews what I read on amazon, these scanners must be amazing 
I bought this camera for my wife for Christmas 04' I thought I ordered it too late for it to arrive on time for Christmas, but these people are great! they got it to me on time and we love this camera we use it all the time - we have several accs. item for it and the quality of the picture are wonderful . Thanks Mark Christian 
I started off with a fully manual camera that I used for my photography classes a few years ago. Once I was ready to upgrade, I came across this camera and fell in love with it. There are enough manual settings to keep me challenged, but the easy automatic settings make this camera perfect for all of my everyday shots. I have taken wonderful, professional quality shots without even changing the settings, and my 14 year old sister found the camera easy to use even though she has almost no knowledge of cameras. This camera is great for photographers in all stages and learning levels, because the pictures turn out great every time and it has enough range to get a great shot no matter what mode you use it in. I really don't think I could ever say enough about this camera to acurately describe it, so my best advice is GO OUT AND GET ONE! You will not regret it 
This is the first SLR camera that I have ever owned. I bought it because I was going on a trip around the world, wanted a nice camera, and had it recommended by a camera shop owner. It is extremely easy to use, so easy that I could hand the camera to someone in one of the countries I visited, point to the button they needed to push and I ended up with a great picture. I didn't need to explain a thing. I also didn't mind carrying it around all day, it is very light for its size. I have owned the camera for four years now and it still takes beautiful pictures. I have taken all sorts of pictures with this camera, from landscapes to action shots and they all turn out great. The action shots are never blurry! The only complaint that I have is that the autofocus does not work well in low lighting, sometimes it is slow and sometimes it won't work at all. In these cases I just turn on the manual focus option. All the options that the camera has are great, but to be honest I rarely use them. I've found that it is often easier to use manual focus than to adjust the camera so it will autofocus off center. If I know that I'm going to be taking action shots or landscapes I will set the camera to that mode, but often I forget and my pictures still look great. I think that this is an excellent camera, especially for someone that is used to a point and shoot but wants the extra quality that a SLR camera can give them. There are also many choices when it comes to additional lenses, so when the photography bug gets you, this camera can stay with you 
I am a ameture photographer and I love my new camera, I also enjoy my low price Amazon Your the Best! Im so happy that I finally found a price I can Afford!! Thank You! 
Item was exactly as described. Works perfectly and helped make some great shots at Yosemite 
ive used this product about twice and dont really have any major complaints. my pictures came out great. i used it at a drag strip and needed it for taking pictures of the cars flying by at nighttime and i was able to capture them nicely due to no camera shake (using a tripod of course as well). the only thing i dont particularly like is that it goes into the lock position quite easily taking extra pictures that arent needed, and also the small hole for the wire to be inserted in for packing doesnt really hold it that well and the wire just kinda unravels, but i would recommend it to anyone who has a need for it 
The Canon RS-60E3 is all that Canon says it is....it is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash, focus, then release the shutter once, a multiple of times, or hold it open for bulb exposure. Although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture, it was simple enough to make an "extension" that allows for very remote exposures 
I don't know how I ever did without this little item. Its indispensable for taking pictures with a tripod. It works easily and efficiently exactly as describe 
I wish I'd bought this a LOOOONG time ago! It is so helpful, esp. with macro shots. Highly recommend 
Worked well while I took pictures of fireworks over Lake Tahoe on the 4th of July. Only wish camera accessories with Canon logo weren't so expensive. 
Using photoshop, and being a big fan of bulb exposures the RS60 E3 is a must have accesory. You can use it just as you would the shutter button on the Digital rebel, as well as lock the shutter open, which is very good for painting with a small flashlight, etc. My only qualm with the switch is the shortness of the cord, but if you're trying to take a self portrait with the remote, then you need to get the Infrared remote. The two of those combined makes for a perfect pair of tools for any remote picture taking needs 
It does what it says it'll do, and while it's pricey for a couple of contact switches in a plastic handle, considering the cost of parts and my time to make something similar, it's a bargain. I would have liked more heavy duty construction, and the contacts to have more definite tactile feedback for the focus vs shoot position, but it works just fine, and it lets me take pictures while talking more easily to the subject, in addition to the obvious vibration reduction 
I purchased this Canon Remote Switch about 4 months ago and I use it almost constantly. This is one of the most useful camera accessories that I have purchased. Every photographer should have one in his/her toolbox. A remote switch is essential if you do photos in low light or macro photography. The slightest movement of your camera when you press the shutter release could cause your photo to be ruined. This switch eliminates "camera shake." Before I purchased this switch, I had to use the self-timer feature on my camera and the time delay was very inconvenient. There have been a few reviews saying that the Canon Remote Switch is over-priced and cheaply made. I don't think that is true at all! I would definitely buy this accessory again. 
Made of a durable nylon outer shell and a soft lining in the interior, this soft case offers the ability to protect your lens. The double front zipper easily opens to reveal easy access to the lens cavity. The top of the zippered flap is secured in place with Velcro for a solid seal. Securely attached to the sides of the case are D rings. These rings are used to snap the quarter inch thin shoulder strap in place for carrying the case and lens around. If this carrying option doesn't appeal to you, a belt loop is included on the back of the strap for carrying the case and lens attached to your belt, or possible your camera bag if it accepts attachments. The bottom of the case features a cardboard lined fake leather surface allowing the lens to rest standing on solid surfaces such as a table. This case is meant for use with the 180mm f/3.5L, 70-200mm f/2.8L, 80-200mm f/2.8L 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L EF lenses. These L lenses normally come with the case when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. However if your case is worn, replacing it to protect your lens is recommended. PROS: Protects your glass investment Durable construction Built for mobility outside of your camera bag CONS: I cannot think of an 
The Canon EF 85mm f1.2L lens has earned ample praise from photographers and critics alike as one of the finest portrait (medium telephoto) lenses available. It is the only one currently produced with a maxium aperture of f1.2 (About a decade ago Carl Zeiss introduced a special, limited edition 85mm f1.2 Planar for its Contax manual focus 35mm SLR system; this lens is alleged to be optically superior to Canon's.). This new improved version of the 85mm f1.2 can autofocus 1.8x faster than its predecessor, via a USM motor for relatively whisper-quiet operation. A fine optic for working under low-light conditions, the lens is now better due to its improved optical design and faster autofocusing. Without question it has been one of the finest L series Canon lenses available; these new improvements will only enhance its reputation. If I owned Canon equipment and had to choose between the Canon EF 85mm f1.2L II USM lens or its illustrious predecessor, then without question I would be willing to acquire this fine new lens 
I bought this lens as I was walking out to Africa for a month and a half safari. I didn't own a true wide angle lens and I had just spent most of my budget on a 70-200mm USM "L" lens and a 1.4x extension. I wanted to get the widest lens I could get but I didn't have the big bucks to get the 16-35L or the 14mm L so I got this lens figuring I could correct in Photoshop CS2 later. This is what I found: 1) I have a 20D and it doesn't barrel distort anywhere near as bad as I had thought it would....I imagine it distorts quite a bit more on a 5D or other full frame sensor but on the 20D, 10D, 30D, or Rebel it is not that bad. 2) It does distort enough even on the 20D that its noticable on every single inside shot and on many panoramic shots....to the experienced professional, you'd notice it even in panoramas. 3) For the computer person: I find it very easy to correct the barrel distortion in Photoshop CS2 very easily....I use a plugin (there are several on the web) 4) I tend to like the barrel distortion look on some of my pictures. Pros 1) Image Quality is superb. For not being an L lens, this lens has some amazing color, sharpness, and saturation. They spared very little in grinding this lens. Some of my best African pictures, daytime and nightime were taken with this lens and they were fabulous. 2) Build pretty well, metal mount, metal integrated hood...but not up to L standards by any means....to its credit, it survived 14 days by vibration ridden truck treking across the Kalahari desert with all its dust, mokoro canoeing in the okavango delta for over a week, hiking, elephant riding, and the five diamond resort at victoria falls (the last one was easy for the fisheye)... 3) It is a Fisheye lens and if used properly, it can create some amazing pictures and views...for example In Botswana in the Okavango, I knelt down next to a Gigantic Baobab tree and pointed it up towards the sky, The fisheye captured not only Rex the guide standing next to the tree but the entire massive trunk of the Baobab AND ALL of the canopy of the tree way above. Everything! I know of few lenses that would let me do that. It was an amazing shot only possible with a Fisheye. 4) It focuses to about 12inches. 5) f/2.8 makes it very good in low light situation. 6) The integrated hood comes complete with a nice metal cover. Cons 1) Its not built like an L: a) no USM motor so you can hear the whir as it tries to focus b) no moisture seals etc c) It does have a metal mount 2) It is a fisheye lens -- I found out after a month and a half what this meant....it doesn't stay on my camera much. I take it out when I need a certain effect or when I plan to retouch in Photoshop. It distorts visibly on a 20D and I imagine quite a bit more on a full frame. 3) Integrated Hood...can't put screw on filters...but it does have a gel filter holder. 4) No bag. My veredict: 1) I've purchased a 16-35mm Canon "L" and that lens stays in camera most of the time when I want wide-angle but when I need a special look or I really want to capture everything, I bring out my 15mm Fisheye. I won't sell it, I don't regret buying it. I learned what a specialty Fisheye lens is and its staying in my arsenal for those special shots. 2) I can't compare against non-canon lenses but I can say that Canon quality here is extraordinary. I would knock them on the construction but the lens is built well enough and the "glass" itself is spectacular so 5 stars. 3) I ordered from Amazon 3 days before my trip --- it arrived the next day. Great Service. Thx Amazon. 
For anyone who wants to make their photos different, this is the lens! With 180 degree capacity and fabulous auto focus capability, this lens takes an ordinary photo and turns it into something extraoridinary. I shoot for magazines and many of the photos that are selected for publication are taken with the lens. It's an expensive toy, but worth the money when you see the results. I highly recommend it 
The fisheye lens is a lot of fun, and I enjoy using mine. However, I find that the practicality of the lens is minimal. I don't usually want my "serious" photographs to have fisheye distortion. I don't tend to like the 1.6x crop on Canon's lower-end digital SLR cameras, but with the fisheye this has an interesting benefit: it's reasonably easy to use the fisheye as a standard wide-angle lens, since most of the distortion is removed by the 1.6x crop. You can still get distortion, but it's a lot easier to compose a shot without it using a 1.6x camera than a full-frame camera. Either way, lots of fun. Buy one for the enjoyment, or even for professional assignments if your work calls for it, but think about if you really want the distortion before getting one of these 
Let me first start off by saying - long time canon user. I own 6 or 7 lenses, including three L series lenses, and this is by far one of my favorites - if not my absolute favorite. I shoot mostly glamour and erotica type work on a 20D. So right there, this lens is not a true 15mm for me - but 1.6x15mm. It's sharp as a tack. It's light weight. It's very short (I call it the nub lens). And it's autofocus is amazing. Very little barrel distortion... and highly recommended. This lens is probably as sharp (if not sharper) than my 24-70 2.8L or my 17-40 4.0L lens. 
Bought these for my Nikon D200 about 3 months ago. Never having used Tiffen before I took a chance on a recommendation. Vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse I've seen. Build quality of all the filters is really not very good. Going to go back to Hoya's which are much better 
I feel that these filters are not required if you have digital camera the coze you you can do what ever you like by computer graphics programs only the UV protector is important 
Excellent performance, at a reasonable price. Highly recomend this product 
I have found that Tiffen filters offer unlimited possibilites. With this kit you get three great filters. Most important being the Circular Polarizer. If you are shooting outdoors it is a must have. You also get the 812 warming filter which I have found to bring great depths of warmth to photographs. Filters protect lenses and Tiffen I have found to be great quality and this is a great value 
First, let me cover the most important point: Does it work? Yes. The praise that most users express for this item is well merited. I purchased this because, like everyone else, normal batteries just did not last. Ten or fifteen photos in, especially if you used flash, and they'd be ready for a change; even the so-called "Heavy Duty" or those marketed as "Digital Camera" didn't make a difference. Well, both of those terms should be reserved for these power cells; they really are less like a battery and more like a power pack. On my first charge up, which took only 3 hours and 6 minutes - I timed it - I wanted to actually test how many photos one could get. On my smaller camera, a 3MP Fujifilm Finepix S3100, I got 52 photos, some with flash, most without. Not random snaps to see how many it could record, but actually taking the time to frame them, select composition, etc. The camera stayed on the entire time using the full LCD rather than viewfinder, took all photos on highest-resolution setting, transferred between auto, manual, and situational modes, charged full flash about 8 times, and went into preview mode. Three hours, 47 minutes later, I got a "low battery" warning - not depleted - low. I stopped then, sure that I had not overpaid. **Note: These power cells will likely last much longer than 3h47m. Lower resolution may result in more photos. These numbers simply represent an unscientific but strenuous personal test to see what the product would do. Other notes about the product: - All parts except for door are made of hard, impact resistant plastic. - Fold away plug in back makes charger easier to store. - Red and Green LEDs are very bright, no mistake between charge and full mode. - Has two "channels", A and B. Seems to charge sets of batteries best; this may have been an issue with another reviewer who reported issues with using one battery at a time. - Black (body back), silver (body front) and blue (door) looks nice. I have one complaint, though perhaps it's only one founded in pure puzzlement. The door flips open...to the right. When holding the unit in your hand, with the Monster logo at the top and the LED at the bottom, the door flips open to the right. My guess is that this decision was made so that the door didn't close on your hand when loading, because most people will tilt it in their left hand so that it's facing away from them at about 45 degrees; I know I do. My final review: 5 out of 5 
Monster is a little pricey, as everyone knows, but it's good stuff. This unit is attractive, works well and is nicely designed. Only one very small drawback: unless you have small pointy fingers, the first battery is a little hard to remove. I use a little plastic relay tool to lever it out, which I store right in the charger. But I stayed with 5 stars for this one 
After reading the reviews, just bought the charger. The first charge took about 3 hours, then the led turned green. I accidentally disconnected the power, when I plug it again, the led turns orange, and start charging again. Will this hurt the battery 
Compact Design....bought it since 2002.....still going strong...went to soo many trips wit me...and easily fit in ur luggage.... now i use that for my Travel only and use Powerex MH-C204 F for my daily use... can take at least 2 hours of pics wit my Minolta Z 
2 years of HEAVY use - not even one little bitty problem. They've traveled well under harsh conditions, and they still function wonderfully. There you go 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
The leather, design, craftmanship all exceed my expectation. Instead of velcro, it replaced with magnetic button, which is a plus. It also included a matching leather wrist strap with Canon logo, another plus. My Canon sd40 can also fit into nicely, although leave some room on the side 
Very impressed with the prompt service and delivery of said product. It is perfect for our new canon camera. Congratulations 
Fits my Canon SD550 perfectly and no complains abt that. The quality of the product is pretty good. When used with the belt clip, its easy to open and easy to put the camera back. Camera seems very secured when used with the belt clip. 
I'm the owner of Canon SD630.This case fit very good to my camera and it is very good kind of leather 
Quality leather case is great for the Canon Elph digital cameras. The only negative is that there is no place to store extra battery or memory card 
I have the cannon SD600 and i've been pleased with my carrying case, it takes a beating but protects my camera nicely. Highly recommend both the camera and this case 
I received case quickly and love it! It is a perfect fit for the sd700IS and protects it nicely. It is also a nice quality leather that looks nice as well 
I had originally bought a case from walmart but it just wasnt working out. What a difference this one made. Fits like a glove and well worth the few extra dollars this one cost in comparison to the ill fitting one. I highly recomend this for your canon sd630 Plus the service and delivery were excellent 
I wish there was also a photo that showed the backside of this camera case. If there was I would have known that this excellent quality case unfortunately does not have a belt loop which is what I was looking for in this product. Great quality nevertheless

I am a technology guru and this camera is simple to use and has great results. The touch screen is awesome!!! Battery life is so much better than other cameras i have owned. I think this one will outlast and perform any of them. BUY IT NOW if you want a quality camera that will make you happy!! 
I am not the most experienced photographer, but this camera takes terrific pictures, in my opinion. Nice big LCD screen and the touch screen is a great feature 
Quick, compact, light and brilliant pictures but lacking veiw finder and "anti-shake" syste 
Camera works great for us so far... we had a 3 year old digital camera so this was an upgrade to better technology... takes much better pictures than our old one... the video is great (except in very low light)... we've taken a lot of short video clips of our kids for grandma (etc)... nobody in our family wants to watch more than about 5 minutes of any one home video anyway... so this camera saves us from having to buy a camcorder... (although with our 1GB card we could take 45 minutes or so of continuous video at the medium setting)... the touch screen is great and simple... the camera has quick response time and the indoor and action pictures are again great for pictures of our kids running around or birthday parties... I took about 92 minutes of video and 55 pictures (plus sharing images and videos with others) before the battery ran out for the first time (a couple of weeks of shooting in our family). I guess everyone has their own needs when picking a digital camera, but this one works great for ours 
WOW!!! This is my 4th Sony, I keep trading up and I am so impressed. There is no delay on the shutter speed, great pictures and enough special effects to be fun, but not enough that you need a PHD to operate 
I have been using my Sony Cybershot DSCN1 8.1MP for about a month now. It's so easy to use. And, I love how you can easily delete picture via the touch screen. The only issue I have with it, is that I can't use the Memory Pro Stick with my Sony photo printer (a 5 year old model), because the stick is not compatible. ps: don't forget to buy a memory stick pro if you purchase this camera. you're gonna need it. 
In the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts, the D70s has fallen behind the pack. (However, if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.) Nevertheless, it's quite a good camera. What I like about it most: - It looks and feels solid. Some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars. It's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a Hummer over, but it certainly seems to outdo DSLRs in it's category. - Very good battery life. - Backwards compatibility with decade's worth of Nikon SLR lenses. My gripes: - The latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week. - Inability to meter through older manual focus lenses. - Lack of full functionality with flashes other than the SB-600 and SB-800. - Nikon's RAW software and control software aren't included with the camera, and are IMHO overpriced. (...and on top of that, Nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...) What would improve this camera the most: - ISO 100 and ISO 3200+ - Ability to store multiple custom white balance presets, and then pull them up on the fly. - Replacing the "idiot modes" (i.e. "portrait", "landscape", etc.) with modes that you could customize 
When digital cameras first came out, I, like many people swore I'd always be loyal to film. Digital could never take the place of film. I'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely. There's still something I love about putting a roll of film in the camera, shooting away, sending the film to be processed, and seeing the results. I also know it's a bit expensive. I know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion, but digital cameras are improving in this regard, and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving, we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital SLR and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera. So I figured now is the time to get a digital SLR. I have been a loyal Nikon user for nearly ten years, and have owned the Nikon N60, N70, and N80. My first love was, and still is the N70 (I've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought I was the only person who loved the N70). I purchased the N80 only after my N70 cost too much to repair, but I've enjoyed the way my various Nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if I don't have the time to use specific controls, but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes. My Nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes, wildlife shots and all sorts of other things I can't resist to capture forever. I decided to purchase the D70 since it was close to what I've already experienced with Nikon. In many ways it works in a similar way to the N70 and 80, except it's a digital rather than film version. Like the film versions of the midrange Nikon SLR's, it has a dial that allows an automatic setting, portrait, landscape, sports, close-up, nightscape, and night portrait modes, the ability to select aperture, shutter speed or manual controls. The camera has auto and manual focus abilities. Photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires. The controls are easy to use, though it takes practice to be comfortable. On a personal level, the camera has passed the Halloween test, niece's birthday test, and fall foliage in New England test and favorite scenic spots test. The only real difficulty I've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting. Auto focus has not worked at all and I'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots, but at this point I'm sure it's the photographer and not the camera. I do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera. The manual is very confusing. It uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else. I've had luck with the "Magic Lantern Guides" with my other cameras, but have not as of yet used it for this camera. I did purchase the NIKON D70 FIELD GUIDE (David Busch, Wiley Publishing) which has been helpful. It can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with Nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography. 
I am a professional photographer, and I have owned this camera for nearly two years. I also have a D70 for backup. The batteries go forever, it is very quick to respond, the images are beautiful, and it has the typical Nikon durability and reliability. If you are already a Nikon user, the controls will fall easily to hand. That having been said, the computer software with this camera is a joke. For the best image quality shoot RAW files, color balance with a grey card, and render the images with software like Capture One LE. The uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars. Come on, Nikon, be real!!! Shortly after I got my first D70, I shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog. I got an ugly feeling in my gut when I was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure, cropped to the head and shoulders, and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog. By the time I found out, it was already at the printer. As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great. After that incident, I have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results. This camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button. In resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera. It is imperative to shoot RAW and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera. I can't wait to try the D80 
The D70s is a minor update of the original D70 introduced in 2004, with a few new features and a slightly larger LCD. It's still a great camera, but expect it to be replaced by the new D80, which has 40 percent more pixels, a 2.5-inch LCD, and additional useful features at the old price of the D70s. So, you can probably save a little money and still purchase a sophisticated digital SLR if you wait until prices of the D70s stabilize at a new, lower level. At, say, $600, this camera would be an incredible bargain. The D70s has shined as one of the best cameras in its class since its introduction. For example, it has a 1/500th second flash synch speed (found in no other camera but the D50) so you can keep ambient light under control and avoid ghost images. Its autofocus is fast and accurate, and features both single-autofocus, continuous-autofocus (for tracking action), and a novel "automatic" autofocus mode that switches between AF-S and AF-C as required. If you have no Nikon lenses, get this camera with the 18-70mm kit lens, which is very sharp and versatile, rather than the more limited 18-55 lens. You won't regret it 
Excellent camera kit. Versatile. I have a lot to learn about the camera, though, as it is no simple point-and-shoot. However, in Auto mode, it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. I look forward to learning how to use it fully. Lenses came with warranty cards, but the camera itself did not. I bought the SB-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 GB compact flash cards to round out the kit. Camera with lens attached is large, which I underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. Great camera, though. Price was the best I could find anywhere 
It has a learning curve, that's for sure, but WOW! This camera is worht every penny, far more stable then the comparable Canon Rebel, and the product comes with better lenses. The quality of glass DOES matter 
Though the lenses for my Nikon D50 were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this UV Protection Filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense. I feel less stress when I clean the filter lens than if I was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass. This size, 52mm, was what was specified for my D50 and it fits perfectly, as it should. I have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller. If you are new to digital SLR's like I was then get this filter to protect your lens. And spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens. 
This filter is a must have for photographers that care about their gear. It remains a cost effective tool for protecting the camera lens while serving as a great every day filter. 
Just what I needed with out having to spend a fortune on a glass filter to protect my expensive Nikon Lenses. I bought one for each of my different lenses because I would rather break the filter than the glass on the lens 
This filter is fine for normal shooting, but if you do low-light work, beware; you will see bad internal reflections on night shots, and will need to remove the filter 
A basic protection item you should have. Does not appear to be multi-coated, as the more expensive Hoya filters are, but clearly worth it. Fits the Nikon 18-55mm ED perfectly and allows the Nikon lens hood to fit well 
The filter is decent. I paid only $3 with free shipping so im not expecting much out of this filter. I bought it for protection and it does that perfectly. Not the best for night shots obviously but overall a good buy 
I have had this camera for several months now and could not be happier. I'll preface this posting by saying that I always do meticulous research (borderline a%$l retentive) before making purchases over $400. This camera was no exception. I was using a "credit card" camera before and was often disappointed with the results. This camera has corrected that in a big way. The pictures are crisp and the video files are very good (although they do hog a lot of memory). You must upgrade the memory card that is provided. The battery life for me has been equal to the credit card camera I had in the past. If you take a lot of videos battery life will shorten. I carry extras in my case. Having always been an amateur "photog" this camera is an excellent upgrade. The weight and feel of the camera is perfect for me. I have friend who has a Nikon. The only real difference that I can see is that he can change lens for various situations, oh and about 500 bucks. Overall this is a very good camera. 
Great product for people that want more out of their digital camera. Not so easy to operate at the beginning, but learning is quick and the results are extremely satisfying. With a little dedication, you will be able manipulate the secrets of high end photography. Best buy for the buck 
As an early adopter of digital, dating from 1999 and the Agfa ePhoto 1280 and 1680 to the current iteration of the Nikon family, I can attest that this camera is as flexible as any of my film cameras that I use for studio and location work. Fujifilm has migrated the best features of a mecanical film camera over to this model. From a hot shoe for external mounted flash and a sync terminal for off camera flash, to the cable release socket on the shutter button, Fuji has melded the best of the analog with the best of the digital. With 9 mega pixel resolution, ISO from 80 to 1600, shutter speeds from 30 seconds to 1/4000, a 1.6 inch CCD sensor, Fujinon 28 to 300 mm (135 equivalent) zoom, tilting LCD monitor (if you use those things), RAW file format support, real time histogram display, eleven shooting modes, movie recording, AF assist illuminator and full manual control when needed, Nikon, Canon, Olympus, et al have a lot of catching up to do. No need to change lenses means a sealed camera and that equates to the sensor staying spring time fresh in the body. No dust getting in every time a lens is swapped (although, I still miss all that Nikon glass). All this for less than $ 600.0 
I bought this camera based on several online reviews, including Steve's Digicams, and couldn't be more pleased. I've been using it since last Christmas (bought it as a present to myself after six months of looking at various brands and models). Aside from image quality (which it has plenty of) I insisted on at least an LCD viewfinder (EVF) as well as screen, a real filter ring (no adapters, please!) easy basic controls, long optical zoom, CF card, hot shoe and the ability to use ordinary AA batteries in a pinch. Also had to fit my hand and feel natural. This had all that, plus an actual cable release socket in the shutter button! (Thus I can easily use my cable and bulb releases, as well as a long-duration timer I have in my 35mm kit.) It also has a standard pc socket for more flash options than the built in flash or hot shoe. The heft is good, but not very heavy. You can carry it for a long time without fatigue, but it has enough mass to steady your hand, and enough size for easy gripping. I find it very instinctive to point and shoot with it. Most of the basic control locations are convenient and easily remembered. (Zoom is manual only, but that suits me. I don't like waiting for motorized zooms to get where I want, especially with a zoom range this long.) I'll leave it to the pro reviewers to discuss the image merits, but I will say that for me they seem perfectly sharp with very good color even at the default settings. In addition, I've gotten very good results shooting at night with very long exposures. (Starry sky, clouds backlit by the moon, streets under moonlight and streetlamps, etc.) Much less noise and "grain" than I've experienced with other cameras. So far it's the closest to film I've found in such situations - at any price I can afford, at least. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is bright and sharp and performs well in low light. I don't miss an optical viewfinder much at all. There's a diopter adjustment to accomodate most people's visiion. (Stops just short of enough for my worst eye - comes closer than most, though - but I find I can use the EFV with my glasses on if I want). One accessory I strongly recommend is a soft rubber, wide angle, lens shade (for a 58mm filter ring). They can be found cheap (I paid $7 at a local store) and will protect the rim of the lens when you set down the camera in addition to shading the lens. There is an included hard-plastic lens shade that clips on the outside of the lens's rim, but t's "notched" and I worry about catching it on things - I like the soft rubber ones better (they look more "pro" too). It may interfere with the supplemental illumination lamp for focussing, so you'll want to remove it when shooting close to mid-range photos in dim light 
I spent a lot of time reading reviews and posts, finally I bought it, it is the best camera I have used, I went from an old Konica 35mm film camera to a Sony Cybershot 2 mp and then to not having a camera for a while later I had a Kodak P850 (great camera also, but slow to my taste) and finally this S9000, belive me this is a great choice it is the only camera that I have found that is positivly compared to DLSR and still being a prosumer camera, that tells a lot. The lack of picture stabilization is not a big deal, it has the anti blur mode which is almost the same, and have a full array of controls and manual settings that will help and please from amateurs to not so ameteurs. It also has the first steps os face detection in it's multifocus mode, which focuses most of the times in subjects faces where ever they are on the frame (not necesary centered), I have to mention it has its limitations and you have to know how to compose your shot. The User guide is easy to read, understand and follow, you don't have to know nothing about photografy with this manul you will use most of the functions in a few hours with easy. Summary: 5 of 5!!! Nice camera 
Many of the options on this camera are mechanically on the body of the camera rather than on an internal menu so wanting a change in focusing method etc is easy! Shaking is no problem with the 10.7x optical zoom and warning icons appear if it may be a problem. Icons appear if the subject isn't focused warning you to change the focusing method. Automatic power turnoff to save batteries after two or five minutes, your choice. You can set the camera to take instant pictures; again, your choice. This camera allows you to set your options rather than have the camera go to default after power off and having to change it back to your option. That was a problem I had with my previous camera. Maybe a little pricey, but the results are great! 
(Wife of account holder)I knew before I bought this camera it was just what I needed! I am a semi-pro-am that does photography as a hobby and a job. I knew I didn't need the $5K camera we have at work, but wanted something more than my $200 point and shoot. This is it! Out of the box, it took about 15 min to take my first pic. Hardest part was threading the camera strap with the lens cap holder - a nice little detail. The main selling point for me was the "Natural Light" mode. Tried with flash and without in N mode and the quality is amazing. My little P didn't do any good in low light without flash, this camera gets an A+. A few minor notes I wanted to make before I was lovestruck: The LCD screen has no protection, just kind of out there in the open. A cover or even just that little plastic stick-on most low end cameras come with would be enough to make me feel like it isn't going to bust. The viewfinder is really just a mini-LCD screen, which I imagine does a bit of a number on the batteries, though not as much as the full size LCD on the back. The menu looks pretty extensive, but fairly easy to navigate once it becomes a little more familiar. So far, I love it, but took off one star because of the LCD issue. Maybe I can find a cover or something for it to help me feel better about it. Other than that, I can already tell this camera will do everything I need to take great pics and get creative with some manual settings and exposure manipulation. Love that it takes xD and CF cards - and both can be in the camera at the same time! Save movies to one, pics to the other! It feels pretty solid, and takes super inexpensive AA batteries - another selling point for me, as were the hot shoe and sync capabilities. If you are looking to go SLR, but can't fork out the dough, this is a perfect alternative. (Though check around for price - with [...] rebate, I got mine for less than [...]!! 
Good price for a 9MP camera with 10x zoom. Image quality is good. I'm still shooting mainly on the 3MP and 5MP with good results. The spot metering works really well, especially while shooting on a bright day with the objects sitting under an umbrella. The Macro works nicely. I still yet to find a good use for the Super Macro. The camera recycles between shots pretty quick. The anti-blur mode (using higher ISO rate) works well. Controls/menu make sense. Although I wish the memory switch feature is not buried too deep in the menu. That's another good feature. You can have 2 memory cards in the camera and with the xD being so cheap. You can combined the capacity instead of having to buy a bigger and more expensive card. I especially like how the menu is displayed even inside the viewfinder (it's an exact copy of the LCD). That way, I don't have to take my eyes off of my object while cycling through the menu. I wish the battery life could be better. In effort to conserve battery power, I shoot mainly using the viewfinder and avoid using the flash by using the anti-blur mode. But on the bright side, one can just carry more high-capacity, rechargeable AA's. It just takes a while to get used to the battery consumption rate. I carry a 2 sets of backups where the third one is Alkaline 
I love the capacity of these batteries. Use them for my handheld GPS, digital cameras, 35MM cameras, flashes, and everything else that I can. The car power adaptor is really nice for road trips! The charger can recharge 4 batteries at a time (either AA or AAA), and can charge even the 2100 mAH batteries in under 75 minutes (under an hour for "typical" rechargeables of 1600 or fewer mAH). I do not like leaving the charger plugged in, because I can hear it clicking when there are no batteries in it (but I hear lots of things that wouldn't bother a normal person). Also, the price is pretty high. I have succesfully used other batteries in the charger (it comes with 8 2100 mAH NiMH batteries that do seem to last longer than other brands of rechargeable). Ask for it for Christmas...hope for a discount (which appears to be pretty rare for MonsterCable products) 
I paid $225 out the door for this camera and it competes with cameras almost twice that price! On the automatic setting, it takes incredible photos, but has the capability to go manual if you are so inclined. For the price, there is nothing on the market that comes close. The macro on this camera is great and the close ups I have taken even on the automatic setting are unbelievable. If you are looking for something that is SLR like, but not the SLR price, this comes close. Of course, the SLR's will take better photos if you are an expert, but if you are an amateur or intermediate photographer and want something that gets the job done, put this one on your list...taking the price into consideration this thing doesnt disappoint. You will be glad you purchased this one! 
I am pleased with this camera. Its pretty easy to use. I have virtually no camera experience, save for breaking them. This camera is easy to operate and is pretty fun to fool around with. I have used the aperture setting several times to get different focus points on the pics. The instructions were easy to comprehend. I have taken quite a bit of Sports photos and I have noticed its extremely difficult to get shots inside a gymnasium. The shots are usually very blurry and the color just isn't right most of the time. Fluorescent modes on the camera are helpful, but do not fix the problem. It could just be me though 
i like this camera very much is easy to use and gets good result 
Reviewed most digital cameras on the market today to replace a worn Olympus. Decided that this camera fitted my needs even though I had never purchased a Fuji camera before. I bought it before I made a two-week vacation to Greece. WOW. I was stunned by the quality of my pictures. Colors were unbelievably true to nature. I love to take low level lighting pictures like at sunset, sunrise, etc. I couldn't believe the outcome. It gave me some of the most beautiful shots I have ever made with high priced film cameras. And I did this on automatic. No more worries about f stops, speed, etc. for me 
I gave this to my wife for her birthday, and so far no complaints at all. The camera has plenty of functions that you can play with, but it can also work in point and shoot situations. Good quality pictures, and it looks and feels top notch 
Wonderful camara, excellent characteristics, has an ample selection of accessories available and protected by one of you lead in manufacture of camaras and lenses 
I will not repeat what other reviews have stated already, all the reviews below are pretty much correct with this camera being a high quality and easy to use etc etc. The only issue is focusing on a small target such as a name brand logo inside a Rolex watch. It is HARD even in Manual mode (and I actually have alot of digital camera experience). Forget trying to focus in AUTO mode, it won't happen.. at least not without alot of tinkering and stress. If you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items (jewelery, insects, etc.) then I recommend buying a digital SLR camera, Nikon D50 is a good one! This Fuji you are looking at here is perfect for taking pictures of normal things like people, cars, buildings, sites, etc 
It seems surprising that Canon would make a product out of anything but the best materials. Lensmate makes a superior product out of aluminum in black and silver 
The black color of the adapter and hood are a nice match for the gunmetal finish of the S3. The fit is good and they do what they are supposed to. I noticed that the hood tends to "lock" to the adapter if you accidently squeeze it when unscrewing it -- probably because the plastic bends a little. Use a lighter touch and it unscrews right off. The one off-putting thing to me is the price of these two inexpensive pieces of plastic. I know they may be precision-engineered plastic with a nice finish, but please, over 15 dollars each for the two pieces? They're plastic! I know corporations supposedly owe it to stockholders to maximize profits, but perhaps these could have been included with S2/S3 as standard equipment. Or sold for a price more in line with the construction material 
I purchased this for my S2 IS instead of a third-party adapter. The only issue I have is that it's black instead of silver (doesn't match the camera). I also had to make sure I purchased the correct camera bag to hold the camera with the lens adapter attached 
The black of this is the same as on my camera, and with all the parts together, this is one professional looking set up! I am not sure if this hood cuts down on glare/reflection, as I have not used it on a sunny day, but I don't see why it shouldn't. And as cheap as this little product is, it is pretty much a must have with this camera! (S3 IS) One last side note, should you alreay own a extra lens or two. And they happen to be metal, be VERY carful about screwing them into this plastic adaptor! I made that mistake and had to put the whole thing in the fridge for an hour, so the metal would shrink, and I could get the pieces apart 
Very important to shade the camera lenses and avoid flairs. It doesn't fit in the carrier bag designed for Canon S2, S3, though, which is a big time bummer. However, I would recommend it anyways, because the quality of the pictures and the protection of your lenses are worth carrying a different bag for the rest of your stuff 
Works great on my S2IS, clicked on silver on main page but switched to black on order form, didn't notice this but I like the black anyway. Looks good with acc 
Nikon Coolpix is a cool digital camera. Its one of the cheapest digital cameras available (120 $ at the time of purchase). The photos are really good and it has lots of settings like Sunset, Night, Beach, Fireworks, etc. Video recording is also possible. One of the best cost-effective digital cameras 
It is a great camera. It has a small size, good optical zoom and Excellent quality. I love it too much and I take it anywhere and carrying it in it's Nikon small case 
I bought this camera because of the small size, megapixles and zoom + digital zoom. I wanted something to take outdoors into the wilderness and not worry about hurting it. Price wise I feel this camera offers pleanty of featrues at a very reasonable price 
What a wonderful camera. The photos come out sharp and clear. The small size makes it very handy to carry around with you at all times. The photos load very quickly on to the computer. For the price I would rate this a "best buy". I found only one drawback which I feel is minor. In very bright sunlight it is difficult to see the object on the screen unless it is shaded by a hand or a piece of paper or cardboard. But this minor problem would not stop me from purchasing a second Coolpix L4. You can purchase a 512 or l Meg memory card for very little money. Check Amazon for Kingston or SanDisk. I have both and they are great. 
I am not a photographer, but the pictures I take look great. It feels great to know that I can capture memories in vivid color too. (that's the setting I always use.) On the other hand though, there is a long wait time to use the camera again after a picture was taken using the camera flash. I don't quite know why but it seems that if you have to take many pictures in quick succession then using the cameras's flash is not the best way to go! All in all, for the price i paid the quality is quite suitable. If you don't have any experience in photography, buy this one 
This is an excellent pocket camera and it lives up to the Nikon reputation for quality. While it lacks some controls seen on more sophisticated models the pictures will please the most demanding for this class camera. I liked it so well I bought two, one for myself and one as a gift to a budding photographer 
I simply love this camera, it's very tiny in size and takes great pictures and you can buy rechargable batteries or regular batteries if you should choose. it is simple to use, didn't even have to read the manuel. for a starter camera or advance user, get this one, you will love it !!! 
The Coolpix L4 is a great camara. Love the night modes, portrait. Takes great pictures, took it on our honeymoon, and all pictures came out great. It also takes very good movies, I thought it wouldn't and that is why I didn't go for the one with speaker, but seeing the cuality of both pictures and video, I should have gone for the one with mic, that's the L3 
I bought this camera for my sister, as an early Christmas present, thinking I would need some time to set it up for her, well in less then 30 minutes I was ready, It's a awesome camera, I was impressed, of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 SD card. I have sent the site to another sister whom is interested. It is the easiest camera to use and has features that will impress anyone, Great photos from very close to far away. I would recommend this camera to anyone 
Okay, first off, I'd like to say that this is my first AF SLR--I stepped up from my dinosaur of a camera, Canon AE-1 manual focus, and right now I am quite overwhelmed by all the features in this little thing. I'm still in the learning stages of all this technology but let me tell you this, I am having fun! It amazes me that Canon can offer quite an impressive camera for the price. I just received my first few rolls from the developer and the pictures came out amazing--so clear and the colors are very vibrant. Just to let you know, I'm using the 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens. I took the suggestions of many and passed up on the "kit" lens and I'm sure glad I did so. I would highly recommend the f/3.5-4.5 lens, but unfortunately for the rest of you, Amazon has discontinued it. But you could order it from one of the many other photo shops (B, Adorama, etc). Do I have any regrets on this purchase? Absolutely not! I love this camera and even though I've owned it for less than a month, I'm actually thinking about stepping up to the EOS 3 and using this as a backpacking/hiking body. Hmm...what to do, what to do? Do I purchase another body or start a collection of L-series glass? ...that is the question. 
Seems a little much to pay for an "extension cord" but upon receipt I see it is of very high quality and nice build on the connectors. Plus, its a brand item from Canon, so what can you do 
The item was exactly as expected. The packaging for shipment, along with the other item I ordered, was unacceptable. A child could have done better 
If your camera spends any amount of time connected to your computer--either copying pictures, or using the remote capture program--you should have this AC adapter. It is also obviously handy to have if you do a lot of shooting from a fixed location--for instance: a tripod. The adaptor is an ingenious little contraption. There is the normal AC line that runs to the power adapter, but instead of running the DC output to a dedicated jack on the camera body, the connector is in the shape of the normal battery pack. If you look closely at your camera, you will see a little grove at the bottom of the battery compartment providing enough room for a wire to exit. Now for the surprise. I'm planning a trip to Europe. I knew the battery charger that came with the camera, and this AC adapter both support 100-240 volts AC, 50-60 Hz input. Which covers all the worlds power supplies. But the battery charger included with the camera only came with the US power cord. I've been looking for various European cords that would fit the charger so I could keep my batteries topped off overseas. What should I find when I open the box to this adaptor? A complete collection of all the worlds cords, which also happen to fit the charger. What a win, now I can run my camera on AC, and stay charged while I'm on vacation 
Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shaped one and three quarters inch long offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Being so shallow and petal shaped, even this type of protection is limited. Even if the protection is limited, replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing an expensive L lens. This hood is manufactured for the Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L EF and normally comes included with the lens when sold new. There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests. Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. This lens isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem. While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. PROS: Improves contrast and image quality Reduces lens flare problems Offers limited protection to the lens CONS: Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens 
Pros: - Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element. - Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. Cons: - Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat. - Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile 
I'm using this hood for the Canon EF-S 10-22mm lens on a 20D. It's a bit shocking how big this hood is until you realize it's really necessary for the very wide field of view. On the Canon 20D, the lens is equivalent to the EF 16-35mm f2.8, only it's f3.5-4.5. Bottom line is that it does the trick and is made to the same good quality as the rest of Canon's stuff 
Using either on EF 16-35mm lenses or EF-S 10-22mm lenses (on 20D or Rebel bodies with 1.6x crop factor) this hood helps to eliminate (I mean reduce a lot) the flare on sunny days or certain lightning conditions..... highly recommended for those who like to shot at the lower end (16mm) of these lenses. 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
This lens provides the best bang for your buck! The build quality is average, but optically it's a dream! The images that this lens produces is almost L quality. Not to mention having f1.8 on such a cheap lens. I've owned 2 of these so far (the first died when it fell out of my bag), and if my 2nd ever dies, I'll buy another! It's great for both beginners and pros 
This lens is a must have for all beginner photographers. Excellent sharpness and a really fast lens. I know I've heard many complain about the cheap feel of it but at less than $100 you can't beat it. Yes it does have a plastic mount, yes the focus ring is small but the quality of it's pictures and price make it a definite winner until you decide to move up to the much higher priced L's. 
I purchased this lense for the novelty of having an inexpensive 1.8 lense. I use this in low light sport situations like basketball or volleyball - and especially gymnastics where flash is not allowed. I'm not a huge fan of being locked into a focal length, but for anything under 2.8 you don't have a choice. This is definitely not a primary lense for indoor sport shooting, but it's a fun companion when you need the speed of a 1.8 indoors 
For the money, you absolutely can't beat this lens. It's very fast and sharp. Not fast to focus, but what do you expect at $70? I have four lenses , some costing 4x's as much as this one...yet I use this one the most. Anyone looking to step up from the kit lens, or anyone looking to buy a camera body w/out the kits lens should look to buy this lens 
This lens takes very sharp pics. Works great in low light. A true value for the price 
Very happy with the lens, and the price is definately right for an amateur like myself 
Awesome lens, especially for the price. It's very fast and 50mm even at 1.6x mag of my Rebel XT is easily manageable 
This is a good prime lens, although not perfect for the Rebel XT. Sharp throughout most of the range, and good for low-light shots. Overall, a solid buy 
First of all, I am an amature photographer, still on a learning curve. I was an avid film SLR (Minolta XG1) user until I bought this camera. After extensive research, I finially purchased a D50. Over one year later, and over 15,000 shots, I couldn't be happier. The pictures are just amazing. The camera is quick and does what you want it to do. If you are a point and shooter, or someone who does not like to make adjustments for the optimal picture, this camera is not for you. I believe that most people's problems come from lack of experience, bad lens, or in rare situations, a bad camera. You must have patience with this camera to get the best out of your pictures. PROS:::: *Sharp, sharp, sharp - always depends on your lens - I shoot with a Nikon 18-200 VR, and even get wonderful pictures off of a Sigma 70-300 *Instant start up *Instant pictures - press the button and picture is taken immediately *All of the manual control you could want *Great autofocus and metering, once you learn how to use it - I shoot in Aperture priority with autofocus *Great pictures stright out of the camera - I rarely post-process *SD cards - I love the small size and quick write and read speed. Plus the price keeps dropping *Nice LCD - large, and gives an idea of what the photo looks like, but do not trust it (as with any LCD) *Absolutely amazing battery life - I have taken over 300 pictures (without flash) with the battery still reading at full strength CONS:::: *Not ideal for indoor/very low light situations. Bad noise at high ISO, and poor built in flash *No light on the top LCD screen *I don't really care for the "dummy" scene modes - this just may be due to the fact that I haven't used them extensively *It was hard to get used to the small viewfinder when compared to film viewfinders. But I did eventually get used to it *May be too small for big hands With the low light problems, I am looking into a Fuji F30, since most of my low light pictures is with friends and I don't want to carry around a bulky DSLR! Overall, I couldn't be happier! It may be cheaper than most of the other DSLR's, but the power lays in the lens and the photographer. It is an awesome camera that I have learned so much from. Hopefully I will have this gem for a while to come 
The other day I used a friend's standard digital camera for a little while. The whole time I found myself missing the manual zoom, instant response and convient manual buttons on my D50. This camera takes amazing pictures. As an dSLR beginner I used the camera in Auto mode for the first several weeks, now after reading some books on photography I'm slowing starting to use the manual features. The D50 lets me choose the level of control that I'm comfortable with, from full manual to full automatic; and both options are just a turn of the dial away. The body of this camera is built like a tank. Metal and high quality plastics abound. The buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable. It is a beautiful piece of precision engineering 
As an amatuer photographer this gives me the what I need at a price I can afford. It has many features that I am still learning how to use. The difference between the pictures that the D50 takes as a DSLR compared to cheap digital camera is like night and day. I am really happy with this camera and the lens combination I purchased. I can do anything from a macro of a spider to a zoom-in of a squirrel sitting in a tree. The battery has a good life span and I rarely have to change it for my spare while shooting. Remember to puchase seperately your memory card as it is not part of the purchase. I'd recommend at least a 2GB card, which can also be purchased at amazon. I was able to catch a squirrel jumping between trees because of the number of frames you can take each second. It is also so easy to take photos indoors without using flash and being obtrusive during the event you are photographing. I also recommend purchasing 52mm lens filters, to keep your nikkor lenses free of fingerprints, etc. 
Nikon D50 is an absolutely fantastic camera. If you are moving from point and Shoot, you will jump to a completely new leage of photography. Pros: 1. Noise extremely low at ISO 800, and highly usable at 1600. 2. Camera control is good, you get 2.5 frame per second, more than enough for non-professionals. 3. Flash sync is 1/500 sec, one of the best in market. 4. Image quality (IQ) is excellent. Cons: 1. LCD screen is small. 2. Top LCD has no back light. 3. No depth of field review button. Regards, csoura 
I felt the price was very competitive and it was received within the time frame the seller told me it would be. The camera is very easy to handle and has so far taken wonderful shots. It was just what I was hoping it would be 
As a long time film person, I really wanted to find a digital slr that could surpase the feel and quality of film without the guess. other digital cameras were basically point and shoot versions. with two children in athletics year round, the d50 does it all. we've shot over 3000 pictures in the past three months just of soccer and softball. the nikon software makes converting and storing a breeze. the only thing missing was a protector for the viewfinder, it's standard on the d70 and now the d80. there is an aftermarket available that does fine in that dept. I have recommended the d70 to so many people that nikon must put me on their marketing team 
Not much to add to the other positive reviews posted, other than I am another user that loves my D50. Have had it for a year now and shot over 10,000 photos with excellent results (mostly landscape and wildlife). Excellent image quality and the hand grip fits perfectly to both my hand and my husbands. The only CON I can think of at this time is that there is no backlight on the top panel - this makes it difficult to adjust settings in low/ no light situations. Also, for people that are used to the little compact point shoot cameras this might seem a little overwhelming at first and bulky to carry around (which is why I have a little pocket camera for my purse). I also got the 18-200 lens and love it - perfect walk around lens 
The Nikon D50 is my fourth digital camera, and my first SLR camera. I don't know why I didn't try SLR earlier, but now I have decided that I will never go back to non-SLR cameras (well, I still have my other 3 point and shoot digital cameras which sometime is more convenient to carry.) I guess I'm just trying to show how much I like the SLR camera. Now back about the D50. Unless you are shooting sports/actions professionaly (which then you will want to buy the D2H or D2X for faster focusing processor, faster frames per second and larger memory buffer), the D50 is pretty much all you will need (equipped with several lenses of course). The D50 has all the pre-configured settings for the casual photographers ("child" mode is also added for the D50, night landscape mode is not available), and it has the usual P,S,A,M mode for the more serious/advance photographer. I have stopped using the pre-set mode now and strictly uses the aperture priority and the shutter priority mode (as far as the manual mode, I'm not there yet). This shows that this camera is versatile and suitable for all ranges of skills. Comparing with its siblings (D70s, D80, D200), I think whichever you want to buy is fine. They are all great cameras. It comes down to your budget. And comparing to other brand like the canon (Rebel XT or the 30D),or pentax or sony, it will be just brand preference (and what lenses that you already have). Moreover, If you come from a point and shoot camera user, any SLR brand you buy I don't think you will be dissapointed (just the fact that SLR performs better in most important aspect of photography) Image quality of the D50 is good which is #1 factor that I look for in a digital camera. Here are the pros and cons of the D50 in my opinion: Pros: 1. Nice out of the camera result picture quality (on Auto setting, and pre-programmed setting) 2. Fit perfectly on my hand (grip nicely) 3. Instant on and can take picture right away 4. 2.5 frames per second 5. large 2 inch LCD 6. Battery life (will take 400-2000 shots on a single charge depend on how often you use the full power flash) 7. Uses SD card 8. Fast USB2 connection 9. capability to copy and re-size pictures to small size (great for email) 10. repeating #1 again. Great image quality Cons (which are mostly minor): 1. No backlight on top panel 2. No Black and White picture mode 3. No night landscape mode 4. No ISO 100 (and on ISO 1600 the picture is grainy though still usable) 5. No depth-of-field preview button 6. No front command dial 7. 1/4000 max shutter speed I started using this camera for landscape and portrait, but later on I started shooting sports/action and night (low light) settings, hence I added the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 AF-D which is a great prime lens and I'm recommending to everyone to get this "fast" lens. I'm also recommending you to get the Nikon 70-300M f/4-5.6 AF G, which is a nice (for the price) zoom lens. If you have the budget then go for the Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 VR AF-S which I think the best zoom lens that nikon currently have. (The VR really works especially for stationary object. If the object you want to photograph is moving and in low light situation/indoor then you will need a "fast" lens, i.e. lens with large aperture such as f/2.8, f/1.8, or f/1.4 etc) Happy Photographing! 
Make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of L series lenses are compatible. If you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition. The AF only works with lenses f/4 and faster on most camera bodies. You do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body, but the extra reach is really nice 
I have used the 1.4x II extender for over a year. It gives me amazing detail with my 70-200L f/4 lens on a 20D. I use it mostly for wildlife and butterflies. Contrast is good with colors that pop. When shooting on a sunny day the shutter speeds are still quick with the f/5.6 and the background is blurred beautifully. In shade areas and low light a tripod is a must! There hasn't been any sacrifice in subject detail. I can see individual hairs on butterfly bodies even when shooting wide open. This is a great way to get closer without paying a significant amount for a supertelephoto lens 
The 1.4X II teleconverter is a modest update to Canon's earlier 1.4X TC. The mark II allows this extender to be stacked with another of Canon's extenders (either another 1.4X II or the 2X II) without having to separate the two with an extension tube (although the loss of sharpness from stacking extenders may not be acceptable to you). Otherwise, the quality of the newer 1.4X II is supposed to be very similar to the older model, which I've never owned. The 1.4X II is a great way to extend the reach of compatible lenses. Note that not every Canon lens is compatible with this extender. The following is from Canon's Web site: "This tele extender can be used with fixed focal length lenses 135mm and longer (except the 135mm f/2.8 Softfocus lens), and the EF 70-200 f/2.8L, 70-200 f/2.8L IS, 70-200 f/4.0L, and 100-400 f/4.5-5.6L IS zoom lenses." I use it frequently with my Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS, which turns it into a 98-280mm zoom. The extra reach it adds is not tremendous, but it's very welcome when I just need a little more than what the lens alone can give me. I've found no appreciable loss in sharpness from using the 1.4X. Of course, any extender is going to reduce sharpness to some degree, but with normal examination, I can't distinguish photos taken with the 70-200mm that use the 1.4X from those that don't. The fact that the 70-200mm f/2.8L is a very sharp lens to begin with helps in this department. Using the 1.4X decreases your lens' widest aperture 'capability' by one stop. With some lenses, that can be more significant than it appears on the surface; when using a non-pro Canon body (such as my 20D) the lens must have a minimum wide-open aperture 'capability' of f/5.6 for autofocus to work. The lens doesn't have to be set at f/5.6, it just has to be 'capable' of at least f/5.6 after adjusting for the one stop loss from the 1.4X. That means with some camera/lens combinations, adding the 1.4X will force you to focus all of your shots manually. (Note: There is a known 'fix' for this that restores autofocus. I've never needed to try it, but it involves taping over some connector pins on the 1.4X to fool the camera body. Proceed with caution if you try this, and do a Google search to learn how to do it right before attempting it.) The 1.4X also reduces focus speed very slightly. I've only used it on my 70-200mm IS, which has Canon's USM and is a fast-focusing lens to begin with, but the decrease in speed is so slight I really don't notice it. And it does not affect IS (Image Stabilization) at all. The 1.4X is built to the quality of Canon's L-series lenses, which means that it is weather sealed and will keep a Canon pro body and L-series lens weather sealed when used with them. If you're considering this extender, you're probably also considering Canon's 2X II teleconverter. I do not own the 2X but did a lot of research on it before ultimately deciding to go with the 1.4X. The 2X decreases your aperture by two stops, and is reported to have a noticable decrease in sharpness--more than some photographers are willing to live with. On the other hand, I've never read a review that complained about the loss of sharpness from the 1.4X. If you've already invested a lot of money in telephoto lenses, the 1.4X II is a relatively inexpensive way to get even more reach (and value) out of your investment while adding only a modest amount of bulk to your camera bag. Highly recommended 
I was able to use the Canon EF 1.4X II Extender for some nature photography recently in Wyoming. I shot elk in low light conditions so I was shooting pretty much wide open. The extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all. You could see the hairs on the animals heads. It's fantastic 
I've had my Canon A510 for over a year and I still love it. I've taken it on vacation with me several times, including one trip to Yellowstone Park, where I took about 1000 pictures. It's great. It's small and light and I like the way it fits my hand. It's fast. I never have to spend time waiting on it. It takes great pictures! It uses 2 batteries and the batteries last longer than my last camera lasted using 4. The only problem I've had is that occassionally the lens cover will stick and not completely open. I can just barely touch it with my finger and it unsticks and opens the rest of the way so that's not a major issue 
My mom I have each have one of these cameras. Neither, one of us has had any problems until recently. I dropped mine while taking pictures with the timer. The drop on my tile floor smashed the telescoping lens out of alignment and wouldn't close and gave a E8 error on the screen. I contacted the canon US website then, I sent it into the canon repair center in IL. It cost $87 to have it repaired and shipped back. It took about a week and a half to have it returned to me. The only thing I would improve about this camera is the speed, I had trouble taking pictures of my son on the merry go round(but it could be that I need to change settings). It has many features on it and accessories to add on. Since, I am learning more about digital photography this is a great little starter camera to have with many features that canon is known for. Also recently I've been looking at some of the newer canon models, their casing/ bodies look/feel really cheap to me. It may make them lighter but it makes me really afraid that I would break them 
It does what it's supposed to do. Nothing more, nothing less. If it were a little cheaper, I would have given it 5 stars. 
I initially bought this switch to be able to take fireworks pictures with my 30D on a tripod. It worked well for this application. Got some GREAT shots of the fireworks. Have since used it for some wildlife photos and it works well in this application also. The cord from the camera to the switch is only about two feet long. Sufficient for use on a tripod, but perhaps just a little short for any other application for the switch. I consider it "overpriced" for what it is, but if you need a manually operated remote switch, it performs this function well. The release button has an option where you can lock-it "ON". It's useful if you what to leave your camera's shutter open for a long exposure. I didn't research any other brands of remote switches for my Canon 30D. There may be others, but I was in a hurry to have something before the 4th of July, and just ordered it, since I knew is was suppose to work with my camera. It performs it's intended design function. It's overpriced, in my estimation, but if you need one, this one will perform the job. 
Typically fine original design by Canon. I have a "Chinese" copy - it really is - and it works but it's not the same as having the mfr's own. 
This is a good tool, does the job well, and serves the purpose, but is a little overpriced and Canon keeps changing connectors, forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer. I give a 4 Star because of Canon, not because of the product. If you are willing to pay for it, it's a good product. 
The RS-80N3 works as advertized. The cable could have been longer but other than that I am totally pleased 
This camera is pretty good, it's very fast, the photo quality is excellent, video recording mode is awesome, and is perfect to carry everywhere since it's pretty small, but after several months of normal use, the metal case begins to look pretty rusted, that's why i dont give this camera a 5 star rating. But check the flickr photos, you will see examples of the great photo quality of the camera 
I just finished a semester in Brisbane, Australia. I must say, in retrospect, the best thing I took with me on this trip was this camera. She is a champ, definitely an adventurous camera. The thing is cute as hell yet solid like a rock. I cannot remember the amount of times I dropped it in the sand, with no negative consequences whatsoever. I even dipped it in the ocean by mistake once (not encouraged) and the thing still works like a charm. It also has features like Sepia and a weird flash that makes lights do something funny, making the pictures wicked cool. The outer covering has shown wear, but it only helps to acknowledge that this camera can take rough handling. People even comment on this on a positive light, it has become a part of my travelling gear. It is also great for scenic shots, and has the panorama option. In retrospect, it was an amazing buy, and so affordable (I'm on a backpackers' budget)! Only because I have seen amazing skies and breathtaking scenery would I consider upgrading to a camera with better pixelage. But if you are staying in hole-in-the-wall hostels or sleeping on the beach, you don't want to have an expensive camera on you. This thing is great. The battery life is also great (for the sake of topping off the cake) 
Hello All, Lens hoods are pretty much a necessity, but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood I've ever used. Unlike other hoods that screw on, this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one, and release the clips. This leads to problems of alignment, meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right. Although it's a pain and I hate...I don't really have another alternative. Either go w/o a hood, or take this one. Either way, guess I'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one 
I own this hood and Canon Digital Rebel XT. I like the hood. It works well limiting stray light as well as protecting the lens. As you will hear from many experienced photographers (I'm an amateur), they would never shoot pictures without the hood on the lens so why would you? All hoods are expensive for what they are, a piece of plastic, but they serve a necessary function. Get the hood if you want the best from your lenses, including this lens the 50mm f1.8 II. I would give it 5 stars but it is pricey 
I needed a lens hood for my 50mm lens and paying $25 for a hood on a $75 lens might seem ridiculous. However, that might be because the $75 lens is so inexpensive. If the lens was $250 then paying an extra 10% might not seem too bad. I just saw the total cost of the lens and hood for $100 and that's good for a terrific prime lens and its hood. However, please note: the lens hood is rather shallow (1 star reduction) and it is a screw-on two piece kit (1 star reduction). One piece is the adaptor that screws-on where the filters normally go (UV Filter) in front of the lens and is intended to be a permanent integral part of the lens and the second piece is the hood that snaps on and off this adaptor. The adaptor ring retains the same 52mm rim size so your protective filter can go before or after the adaptor. (1 Bonus Star) Because $100 is still a bargain for a 50mm, f1.8, super fast, super sharp, super clear, light weight beginner lens and hood kit! I hope this helps rather than confuse. :) 
It works great with my EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens. The price of this hood with ring seems pricy compare to the lens price, but it does the job when it's really needed. 
Wow... Now if you really want to see a rip-off, here it is. Not to be damaging to Amazon.com but hey for the 50mm just get some carboard and tape it to the front to shield it from the sun. The hood is definitely not worth it 
First off this is a very nice lens for the money. I have had mine now for about three months and love it. It is a great walk around lens the 28-135 is just right for most pictures of kids and landscape pictures. It has a fast focus and sharp clear pictures clear up to the 125 range gets a little soft at 135 but easily fixed with a little post editing. I have taken most of my pictures hand held and the IS works great. I even recommended it to a friend. I am using it on the 30D and it spends most of its time there. I am not sorry I purchased this lens and will be taking a lot more pictures with it in the future. 
I use this all the time at my son's soccer games and get great shots. It's a little on the bigger side, but isn't too heavy and image stabilization really helps out 
I have always used third party lenses before but after trying this Canon I have to say I am impressed with the quality, it feels like a solid piece of equipment rather than a hunk of lightweight plastic. I find my photos to be much sharper due to the IS and the lens itself. I have tremors in my hands and so was having a difficult time with a normal lens but the IS has helped tremendously for that. I like the range of zoom as it is pretty much all purpose for me( have used the kit lens only once since i got this lens when i needed a wider angle). I could occasionally/rarely use a little more distance but nothing is perfect. My only complaint is that the lens is heavy and pretty much doubles the weight of my camera( Rebel xt). You know it's around your neck after a few hours shooting. I haven't had any focus hunting problems,which i had constantly with the 3rd party lenses. and the lens is very quiet which is imo a good thing. For a reasonably priced lens it is well worth the money 
This can be a great 'only lens' for the day. Good weight vs capability for handing most photo opportunities you'll come across. Good price for the versatility the IS function provides 
This is a great lens that can be used for almost everything. It is great if you only want to take one lens with you. Pictures are very sharp and the color is good 
I originally purchased a 30D with the low-end kit lens - to me the pricing didn't really make sense to get either the body or the higher-end IS kit lens. I was looking for a good all-purpose zoom with full-size sensor covereage in case I move up the Canon ranks to a new pro-level model in the future. The 28-135 fits the bill nicely. Although it is fairly heavy, the difference in build and image quality between the 18-55 kit lens is incomparable. This lens takes beautiful pictures and operates flawlessly. I highly recommend it as a day-to-day lens, and the IS is a nice feature for extending the range down a few stops without moving up to the much more expensive faster lenses 
I bought the Rebel XT w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the XTI was introduced, but that's another story. As this is my first DSLR, I was blown away by the results. But after the initial euphoria, there is always room for improvement. My first choice was the 28-200, favoring the longer zoom over the IS, but I found this one used at Penn Camera and got a deal on it and a 380EX flash, so the decision was made for me. I like the zoom range, it's great for framng portraits. If I need wider angle, I still have the kit lens. I won't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes, as I was prepared for this by these reviews before I ever saw the lens. I'm no expert on sharpness, and still trying to get myself dialed in, but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me. I have no "L" lenses to compare to, nor would I make the comparison if I did. In my somewhat uninformed opinion, this is a great step up from the kit lens. This is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with. Being a working guy, I'm extremely happy with it so far, and glad I made the purchase. 
This is a cheap lens - old design, very plastic - that can prove terribly useful for those on a budget who want a wider perspective, especially on 1.6x crop factor dSLRs. I learned about "cheap" with this lens - broke the focus ring the day after delivery. But I blame myself too, and the replacement's given me no trouble, though I think my first one was a bit sharper than the second. By many standards, this lens will match or exceed zoom lens of comparable price (as a prime lens should). Autofocus is a little buzzy, but the main time you'll notice is when it loses its bearing and suddenly lurches way off target. Mostly, focuses quickly enough and well. Some chromatic aberration in worst-case scenarios, but nothing awful or unexpected. Vignetting, even on a 1.6x crop, can be noticeable, mainly in sky shots, but gradual rather than sudden. (Might be unacceptably worse on a full-frame camera.) Undue distortion seems minimal - haven't really checked but also haven't really noticed, if you see what I mean. Flare seems average, perhaps better than one would expect from such wide glass. Bokeh is nonchalant, not dreamy but never intrusive. But at the price, the positives make up for the negative and "average" tendencies. It's vibrantly colorful and contrasty almost to a fault. Hard light is a little more challenging with this lens, a little more tricky to balance exposure between highlights and shadows. It's softish wide-open, but very unobjectionably - have yet to regret shooting at f/2.8. My main lens is a 50mm f/1.4, and switching back and forth on the same aperture setting is perfectly functional in practice. Lose a little crisp for taking in four times as much space, and that's a trade-off I can run with. (Their filter threads match too.) At f/4 and higher, I get "plenty sharp," though I've never seen "unreal sharp" from this glass (as I have from the 50mm). "Crop factor" over-simplifies the effect of mounting a wide-angle lens on a 1.6x camera. Yes, the field of view will match 40mm on a full-frame, but the perspective will not, because you'll be closer to your subjects. Shooting live subjects (like bands, models, or street life) will require a learning curve, so beware mission critical work before you've broken yourself in so you can anticipate its exagerations. That said, I bought this lens primarily for "head-to-toe" model shooting in my modest studio, and it's been a real asset. Interestingly, it tends toward a very useful "slimming effect" that makes hippy girls look more slender and shorter girls more ambiguous in height (at least at the "head-to-toe" distance from them). Disconcerting at first but terribly useful once you've gotten the hang of it. (Beware chicken legs or the reverse from dramatic perspectives.) I read every review I could find before purchase, and this lens seemed to be a magic middle between the higher cost clarity of the 20mm and the cheaper lesser sharpness of the 28mm. Near as I can tell, I nailed it. This is not a spectacular lens, but a very very functional one if you need an affordable wider angle that generally won't let you down 
My existing battery aged and I started to look forward a replacement. After I read several reviews, I preferred to choose the original one, because of heating and performance problems. Therefore, I found a good bundle price If I'd selected the cord, battery and case for my sd100 camera. By the way, I did not have a good case as this new one. I rated 4 stars, because I preferred to stay with the original cord 
It would cost you more to buy these separately. The battery alone could cost this much. The rest of the accessories have come in handy. I originally wanted this only for the battery, but now, I have options. Great value. Buy it 
I am am very happy with this package. The only issue, the thick stainless steel neck strap. I had no use for it and I have never seen anyone using it. I would prefer to have another extra battery or have the existing battery be an extended life one. Overall, for the price you cannot get a leather case and battery combo from somewhere else for the same price at Amazon. I consider the neck strap an unnecessary component as the one that comes with the camera is lighter and more flexible. it is also more elegant.
