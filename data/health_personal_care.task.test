1	such a thoughtful gift . a real treat for those of us living in colder climates - especially in the winter . the warm lotion is truly a treat to dry , itchy winter skin . anyone would love this !
1	this is very soothing for people with arthritis or any kind of injury and makes your hand feel wonderful
1	i tried all the possible creams on the market , cheap and expensive , for my dark circles but this is the only one that worked imediately . i can not live without it , this is a keeper . it stings a little bit , not all the time but it does . it says that it should only be used twice a day but if i 've had a really tiring week and i 'm in a rush to look good i use it up to five six times a day , just a tiny film and with 2 hours between them . i guarantee that in three days you 'll not recognize yourself ( in a good way ) . very important : it tends to dry the skin under the eyes very much so be sure to aplly after a very good cream ( i use pure chamomile cream ) and leave it over night . well , follow my recipe and you 'll shine fast , you 'll see
1	i have owned this pulse meter for approximately 2 weeks and i find it to be accurate , but it takes a while for it to give a reading . the first few times i used it , it took over a minute to tell me my pulse . however , the manual does state that when you become used to the correct positioning of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster . so far , this is true , as within the last 3 days , i have received readings within 10 seconds consistently . considering the price , it was a good purchase
1	i have used olay regenerist perfecting cream for over a year now . it leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely . it does not have spf protection so for daytime i use a lighter moisturizer with spf over it before applying my foundation . at night it 's all you need
1	this was the first brand of nursing pads i tried . my first few weeks of nursing were very painful and these pads were a bit scratchy . yet after trying several brands of nursing pads , i came back to lansinoh . they are the most absorbent and discreet disposable pad out there and after i had been nursing for a while they ended up being the most comfortable . the best deal i have found has been amazon 's price for 3 boxes .
0	i bought this iron for my teen daughters - actually i bought it twice , since i did n't have much choice where i was shopping . both times it died . the first iron lasted about 6 months , and the second lasted 2 weeks ! just dies , no warning . my girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a conair ! i am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research
1	i have owned and broken most grabbers on the market . the fold-up gopher is a joke , another , with a flimsy wire down the center breaks after too much use , and the heavy-duty unit from lowes is hard on the wrist . this unit is the smart way to go ! it is strong and durable and makes the most sense in the way it utilizes the strength of the hand and fingers and relieves pressure from the wrist . also , it is exactly the correct length for a six foot man . no bending at the lumbar required
1	i have had a number of surgeries and injuries over the years . i see a chiropracter and a physical therapist every few weeks . both of them work wonders , but then my body tightens up . i ca n't afford to see them every day ! i bought the theracane because i saw someone else with one at a long distance cycling event . now i 've purchased another 3 to share with friends . it works ! this tool has helped me stay loose , and has taken away a lot of the shoulder stiffness that i have suffered for the past 7 years . i suggest the addition of the trigger point therapy workbook , which will give you a lot of the details about the body and why/where it hurts . but even if you do n't want to study , you can still get lots of benefits from daily use of the theracane
0	if you get it wet it stops working , which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush . if you want something to work for a month or two its fine , otherwise avoid it entirely . i intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture , pretty quickly after ordinary use
1	i came across the hooah drink because my boss -- a retired military man running for office -- always has a case lying around . with campaign season heating up and workdays getting crazy long , these are invaluable for getting me through the day , and keeping my thoughts coherent . apparently military studies said these drinks improve alertness by fifty percent . i ca n't measure that in myself of course , but i do sense a dramatic improvement
1	i bought this product because i had a borderline high reading at my doctor 's office . rather than having the hassle of going to his office and paying a cop-pay just to have it monitored , we purchased this unit . it works wonderful . very simple and gives more information than i expected
0	i was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when i found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early . i tried fiddling with the dst setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than i wanted . the brightness may be a problem for some people but i found it reasonable . overall a good docking station , but a poor alarm clock
1	i have used opti-free enzymatic cleaner for years , still with the same great results . i have a feeling this type of product wo n't be around much longer , because my using extended-wear contacts seems to be a rarity at my optometrist 's office , where everyone else is wearing the disposal lenses that are always in stock
1	i absolutely love this stuff . i would recommend this to any person that has frizz . it makes my hair feel so silky smoothe . i started using it about 2 months ago and can not stand to go without it . just use a little because it can make your hair look oily if you use too much and do n't put it close to the scalp either for the same reason . i tried the chi silk infusion because i thought they would be the same since they are both made by farouk but the chi is not nearly as good . i would give this 100 stars i could .
1	i eat one of these twice a week before i play ice hockey . i specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine , though i do n't perceive any `` boost '' . it could be there and i 'm just not noticing it . i feel they do the job of keeping me fueled for the workout . it would be nice if the package made a specific recommendation about how long before a workout to eat the clif bar . i find the size of a clif bar a bit disappointing , especially considering the `` store '' price of $ 1.50 . at $ 11 a case and with free shipping when spending $ 25 or more , i 've not found a better price than amazon 's on clif bars
0	absolute waste of money , this is not a pillow as advertised , in my opinion falsely , but a flat mat which , when filled with water is a very heavy weight and it is not possible to sleep on this . you could use it to wipe your feet on but thats all . an extremely disappointed customer who suffers from overheating badly in bed and thought this was a great solution . now out of pocket and no better off .
0	i bought this apple humidifier in early november . it stopped working soon at the first time i used it . i later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again . you have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working . i contacted the manufacturer and got replacement . however , the new one has the same problem , and what 's worse , it leaks ! ! i talked to the manufacturer again , but they did n't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else . now i have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do
1	i am a big fan of 2 '' curling irons , but they can be difficult to find . my last one ( different brand ) wore out a couple years ago and i had a hard time finding a replacement until now . i have shoulder length hair , fairly thick , plus wavy and frizzy . 2 '' curling irons do a great job of smoothing and straightening my hair , while also turning it under ( or up , if desired ) at the ends for a nice , finished look . i find it much easier and faster than using a traditional flat/straight iron while achieving superior results . you will not get `` curl '' with this curling iron . you will get smooth hair quickly and easily . highly recommended
0	there is no way to keep this product in place in the mouth other than by keeping pressure on it with your teeth . this defeats the purpose of a product that is supposed to help reduce the grinding and clenching of teeth . very disappointing .
0	skip this entire product . i made the mistake of purchasing it and stocked up on the scrubbing and non-scrubbing ( mopping ? ) pads . now , i ca n't find the non-scrubbing ones anywhere in my entire county . i think they do n't want to compete with their own product `` swiffer '' which they also manufacture . i emailed them and they suggested i buy online . i checked walgreens.com and drugstore.com and no luck . i imagine they will phase this out and you will be stuck with a wasteful `` who gives a hoot '' rod .
1	i use this with my m3 turbo and some kiehl 's closeshavers squadron ultimate brushless shave cream white eagle for my daily morning shave . it 's the best combination for thick tough stubble .
0	the drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them , and i could not get the hooks to work . i finally did get one in place and hung a medium large picture on it , and it failed . far short of the maximum weight on the package . in all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and i think whey would work fine for small and medium pics . the laser tool that was included is neat and i used it for all of my pictures , which i had to hang with other hardware
1	i boutght this razor for my husband . he likes it , but notes that it is hard to clean and does not get the longer whiskers , which he seems to miss a lot . i think that if he shaved more carefully , he would get these whiskers before they get too long ! i think that for the price ( lower end of price range ) , it does a pretty good job . next time , i 'll buy him a more expensive one and hope that it performs better .
1	i love this soap , it 's a little big and hard to hold during shower , but the smell totally makes up for it ! it has a very strong ( but good ) grapefruit smell , it 's very fresh and rinses completely off
0	so i bought two of these bottles , got them home , and discovered the first time i used them that every time you take a sip of water , they squeal like a drowning mouse . it was unbelievably embarassing . the store refused to take them back , so i contacted the company directly ... and ended up in a back-and-forth email exchange with an extremely rude person in customer servide who insisted i was wrong , that the bottles did n't squeal and i was just using them incorrectly . she offered to replace the caps after i wrote back and explained that it was a water bottle , for god 's sake , `` using '' it was n't exactly rocket science . but she 'd only replace them at my expense , which after shipping worked out to be almost what the bottles originally cost . do not buy these bottles ! try one of the fine products at gaiam or new wave enviro
0	owned for 2.5 years . finaly broken . `` the conair often feels as if it is pulling your hair rather than cut it '' - totaly agree
0	they are a waste of time and money . they put goo in your mouth and not as much on your teeth . after a week , my teeth are the same color as when i started
1	back in the early 90s i was going through a bad acne period . i finally visited a dermatologist , and he put me on an accutane regimen . i had sensitive skin and a tough beard , so regular shaving cream was too harsh ( especially while taking accutane - the solid brush-on cream i was using at the time burned the edges of my lips ) . he recommended that i shave with cetaphil . years later , my skin and beard are still troublesome . therefore , i 've kept cetaphil as a part of my shaving regimen . cetaphil goes on well and provides a nice lubrication for my shaver . it 's not harsh or irritating , even on a freshly shaved face . however , it 's kind of cold in the morning , which is a bit counter-productive after heating my face with hot water and shower steam to soften the whiskers . so i put the bottle on the tub floor while showering to heat it up with the runoff . by the time i 'm done , it 's warm enough for application after rubbing some around my hands for a second or two . however , even though cetaphil feels good and lubricates well , its consistency is a bit thin to use alone . i like a good lather , so i combine cetaphil with kiss my face moisture shave , which was recommended to me by a woman working at gnc . they mix well together , and i get a good , non-irritating shave by using the gillette fusion power razor . for post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts , i apply a product that contains salicylic acid , such as clean dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . if you have a razor-challenging beard and skin combination like me , then make cetaphil part of your shaving routine . recommended
1	flax is a plant . the seeds in the flax plant are filled with flaxseed oil , ( sometimes called linseed oil ) . the seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid ( ala ) and linoleic acid . ala is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed . flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids . flaxseed is nature 's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids , and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils , and it costs less , ounce for ounce . flax also contains other important substances like lignans , which may protect against some types of cancer . the husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage . both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties . there are many potential benefits from taking flax seed oil : flaxseed oil lowers cholesterol levels , thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis . flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens . these are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause . flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure . flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema , as it has anti-inflammatory properties . flaxseed may also reduce the itching , swelling , and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne . flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation . flaxseed reduces ldl ( low-density lipoprotein ) cholesterol ( the body 's `` bad cholesterol '' ) and lowers triglyceride levels . research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil . taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk . this is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks , which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer . new research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer . nature made flaxseed oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil , as the company is well-known and reputable . one tip : keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat , as both degrade the oil . the usual beneficial dose of flaxseed oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal . jim `` konedog '' koenig
0	before you buy , be sure to check where the pen was made . i have a number of older cross pens that say `` usa '' near the top , and they are great pens . however , i have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made , and they are of inferior quality . the top and bottom halves are loose , and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap . the first one i got , i sent it back to cross for warranty repair under their `` lifetime guarantee , '' only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a `` handling fee '' attached . i was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly , one bad pen . so later on when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect . my advice : if you want a good cross pen , go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in usa . they are n't making them the same anymore .
0	i 've only used the unit 3 times , and the flip-over trimmer broke when i `` flipped '' it over to attach to the main clipper head . the plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head , that cracked in two , and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor . it 's very disappointing . i 'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer , i ca n't seem to find the receipt
1	excellent product . works well . only problem is that the container holding water could be bigger
0	the oral-b is a good product but the refills certainly are n't worth what they charge for them . i do n't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price . they could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $ 2.50 each , their rip off price of $ 8.50 ea is beyond absurd . the other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months . that 's a real laugh . even brushing just once a day , you 're lucky if you get a month out of them . so not only do they rip you off with their refill cost , they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with
1	i bought this obus forme king sized pillow because i thought it might stop my snoring . i must admit to being surprised that the pillow actually did minimize my night time rattling if not eliminate it completely . there have been reviews that mentioned the pillow had a strange odor at first . i found that it did give off a smell similar to that of a new carpet or some plastics , but that disappeared in just a few days and was never offensive . my wife wanted to try my pillow and liked it so much she kept it . i have just ordered a second pillow .
1	this protein is unbelievable . i have tried *many* different brands/varieties and this is without a doubt one of the best out there . it does n't have the characteristic nausiating whey smell or taste , it 's not too sweet , mixes lump-free in cold or piping hot water and packs a punch with 23g of easily digestable protein per scoop . once you try it , this stuff will definitely become a staple in your pantry .
1	very light electric razor . cuts shaving time from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes . so a charge for 30 minutes of shaving time easily lasts a week . when running it is as quiet as an old fashioned blade . does a great job very quickly and smoothly . you do n't need anything more
0	i bought one last year as it was supposed to be accurate and you could do it yourself . doing it yourself is misleading as the directions for one of measuring sites for women require you to hold it in your right hand and measure the back of your right tricep . impossible to do both at the same time . even with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results . the feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by age never worked . mine was stuck making the classification by the youngest age group for women . basically it ignored specific data entered in for age and male/female . i was very disappointed but was fortunate to get my money back
1	i purchased the mitts for a gift and also for myself . the person for whom i purchased them is very happy with them and so am i. i was looking for a mitt that could keep my hands as hot as possible because i have arthritis and was surprised that the heat stays for more than 1 hour . it is too soon to tell but i hope it will help me with the arthritis in my hands .
1	if you do n't like getting attention , these are not for you . i 'm often surprised by people 's astonished reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off ; i 'm so accustomed to pulling them apart , that i forget how unusual the viewing public finds it . i have been wearing clics for nearly a year . i pretend that i do n't need glasses , but of course i do and have for nearly a decade . popped the standard diopter lenses out , and put in my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite a warning from my optical shop . ( and even if they had broken from the experiment , the price is right : i could try it again . ) previously i was wearing glasses on a chain . besides the various difficulties noted by another reviewer , i also found that the plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses have a bad habit of stretching . then the glasses slip off the chain at inappropriate times and the frames break . i call the color of mine `` magenta '' - which may or may not be the same as the online `` red '' - i bought them in a shop ( **gasp** ) . my short hair is not a problem , but i agree that reading in bed does n't work . so i use a different pair for those occasions
1	i found this blood pressure meter easy to use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings . keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my doctor inform of the results . the size of the cuff is very important , so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the wrong size will give inaccurate results . this is true in the doctors office also . my blood pressure dropped several points in the doctors office , on his machine , just by changing the size of the cuff . this is an excellent monitor - i could n't be happier with it . it is nice to be able to use it with batteries too .
0	i bought this one because it had 4 settings instead of three - so i thought one of them might actually be hot . instead , the highest setting is warm to the touch - not hot . this may be a `` lawsuit friendly '' reality with heating pads today - i 've yet to find one as good as my old one that died 2 years ago ( i had that one for 10+ years , the sunbeam replacement i bought prior to this one lasted 2 and was n't hot ) .
0	no moving parts contrary to depiction above . the `` attachments '' are tiny plastic 1.5 '' knobs that attach to a motionless center peg over which you are supposed to rub your feet ! they do not move . there is no massaging action - you do all the work , making your hips and knees sore . the `` massaging foot beds '' are totally motionless and form a spiky , painful surface . vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device . jets are totally underpowered . no fill line indicator so `` bubbles '' spill water onto floor . heater is completely useless - after 15 minutes water temp was no different . can not return because water ruins loofa and epsom salt pads . classic deception in advertising
0	i owned this set for about 2 and a half years before i finally just gave up and switched to a different brand of hot rollers ( i used it about 4-5 times per year ) . first off , the rollers are very heavy so when you have them all in place , it feels like you are carrying a laundry basket on your head . second , the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an issue when rolling up your hair . third , the clips used to hold the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use . i would roll up my hair ( which would take like , 30 minutes because of the difficulty ) , and if i walked around the house to watch tv while i waited for my hair to set , the clips would spring out of place and shoot across the room . i eventually lost like 6 clips from the `` springing out '' thing . the results of these rollers were great , though . i used them on my wedding day and people loved it . good results , but not worth the time and effort to use these rollers
0	i recently purchased the obus forme lowback backrest , along with the seat cushion . although i have heard people rave about the excellent support , and they felt comfortable enough to me , i ca n't give them more than 2 stars . the material used in their construction drove me to distraction . this is obviously a personal preference type of thing . other folks may have no issues with the material at all . these are just my feelings on the matter : i found the texture of the fabric to be a little rough and it did n't allow easy movement when sitting on/leaning against it , which would drive me crazy after just a few hours at work . also , when making any movements , the compression of the foam , and the friction between it and the fabric covering , made really annoying noises . it reminded me somewhat of snow compressing down when walking on it . the backrest was even worse than the seat cushion because it had a thin plastic wrapping ( looked sort of like shrink wrap or saran wrap ) around the foam inside , which made loud crinkling noises every time i even twitched . it was awful ! however good the science behind the backrest and cushion is , the sound effects and unpleasant texture were distracting enough , to me at least , to return both items .
1	this is a useful tool in that it makes the software/hardware combination available at a less expensive price than any other i am aware of . my only criticism is that there is not a lot of information on interpretation of the output , although from reading heart math literature one can get a sense of what one is doing . however for the price it is definitely worth it and i could see that some people may want to get the game mostly for the option of having this expansion pack
0	i purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature . the positive reviews here are from first impressions . however , i have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use . when i first received it , it felt very light and cheaply made . i gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best . last time it worked , the motor slowed down to almost a halt . i keep it cleaned and oiled . the motor is just too cheap . im not sure what the company wahl was thinking when they made this product . they should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image . i would not even attempt to use my warranty because it 's not defected parts . it 's a total lemon . it would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund . i would even pay the difference . i do not recommend this product
1	it seems to be doing the job ... .my next dental check will tell . it 's a little awkward at first getting used to the brush ( quite a bit different from the conventional brush ) ; and i think though they tell you to hold the handle with two fingers only ( thumb and forefinger ) that you do have to tilt the brush a little to get the gumline . and i still do find a little tartar on my teeth . so , you decide
1	works great but i wish i could find it in stores . the one riteaid that does carry it , does n't always have it in stock . i also can not always find it in just any rite aid . some do n't carry it at all ... annoying ! my daughter is the canker sore sufferer . i did some research before i discovered rembrandt , and found that the ingredient , sodium lauryl sulfate , found in almost all toothepastes is the culprate . rembrandt for canker sores does not contain this key ingredient . sodium lauryl sulfate ( sls ) is what makes our toothepaste foam . my daughter hardly ever has anymore canker sore breakouts . if she does , it seems to be from getting a cold . try and find a toothpaste without sls ... they are n't out there . it would be nice to have some competition to bring the price down and be more readily available . but all in all , i 'm glad someone has made this product available , even if it 's pricey and hard to find .
1	this works best for me . i do n't like a wet or greasy look . this holds well , then dries as if nothing is on the hair . without it , my hair falls down into my eyes . i think it 's the best
1	this sinus rinse works great and it 's easy to use . great price from amazon and quick shipping
0	this razor is not worth the money . it did shave pretty well for a few months , but the rubber strips wear out really quickly . and , even though the `` cleaning option '' with the fluid seems like a great idea ... it does not work very well ... the razor was never clean ... and refilling the fluid is just a pain ... i would not recommend this razor
1	recommend it . suppressed my appetite the first day . when i got hungry it took a few bytes to feel full again
0	this item is very heavy and bulky . descriptions give you the idea that your feet will endure the `` kneading '' action as well as your calves ; however that is not the case . your feet only rest on these two painful round balls that only vibrate should you wish them too . the `` kneading '' pressure can not be regulated , only the speed . the `` kneading '' pressure is very intense and can be very uncomfortable at times . if my massage therapist ever worked like this i would fire immediately . i tired to like it , however quickly returned after a few days
1	i ordered the happylite about 4 months before they even shipped the product , because it was the first reasonably priced ( and sized ) light to help treat sad . living in minnesota , i tend to get depressed in february , so wanted to see if the light would help . starting in oct/nov 2003 , i began turning it on at desk height at my work for the suggested amount of time . i did not use it on weekends . anyway , i think that it helped me keep from sinking so low with the sad blues in february , but it did not completely keep sad away . i spent 4 days on the beach in florida during the 3rd week of february , and that helped the most . i will indeed use the light again this winter , because it helps -- but does not eliminate -- sad for me
1	maybe because i ordered a `` medium '' . it works fine otherwise . i recommend it
1	these are a great , yuumy snack . for someone who counts calories ( or points ) , it 's nice to have an option that is relatively healthy and still tastes great ! i have never met a luna bar i did n't like , though this is my favorite flavor
1	to start - i miss my hair . last september i cut my hip length hair to mid back , and then in december to just at the shoulders , and then again to the chin in january - and from january through june i trimmed it regularly to keep it that length . ( i 've been getting rid of the henna that was in my hair - i could n't get it out via any other method tried except `` growing out '' ) . my hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to grow faster , but i suppose everything slows down the older you get . my last cut was late june - and it was at mid to upper neck length - basically a little bit longer than the chin length cut , and then layered . that got rid of the really saturated henna 'd hair - so i was ready to start growing it out . after much digging around online i came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it - both good and bad . i gave it a shot - got my pills in the first week of july and started taking them . last night - maybe it was wishful thinking , but i noticed a difference in the hair length - it seemed it 'd picked up a little length a little extra quickly - and then my boyfriend commented on it later that day . he knows i 've been working to go back to my natural hair color - and there 's a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the natural hair color . last night he looked at me and said `` hey wow - you 're hair 's really grown - i can see a half inch more of the roots ! wow - you 're hair is getting dark ! '' i was pretty pleased with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins ! i ca n't wait to see how it is in another 2 weeks , come august - if i have another 1/2 inch to add to it , i will definitely be reordering these pills ! but a side note , from previous reviews and my own experience ... it 's a lot of pills to take - but make sure you keep up with them every day . i find taken a stage one pill at morning and afternoon , and then dividing up the stage 2 pills into 3 doses of 2 pills throughout the day works very well .
1	i rate ( green tea fat burner ) 5 star . because i bot another called lipoxinol 70.00 ) and i bot another one called ( green tea fat furner ) and it was better in quality wise and its only 14.99 at costco . lipoxinol is very good as well but more expesive . bot off amazon.it sais its ( made canada ) derctions say to take 4 pills in am 4pills pm . and man there great . the ( green tea fat burners ) in comparison dictions say take 2 pillsam 2pills pm . i over rall i think ( green tea fat burner ) makes me a little bit more hyper . the more hyper the more stuff i do , that means the more excerise i get , , , , , you will see lipoxinal on amazon . its 4 star , this one has less rating for some reason , not many people said much about it , wierd , americans like to pay more money when , this one can work just as great , not all work tho , but like i said this one was great for me in wise , i bot both , dont go off telling every one u are taking weight loss pills because people will get worryed , like theres no problem , people drink coffee every day of there life , i told my mom and she thot i was crazy , but what dose my mom know , she never tryed weight loss pills , i tryed ntoher one from the natral food store call mini skiny fat burner and i felt like i just shot my self with cocane , so be carfull , earbs have been used for thousand of years and can make u drug crazy ,
1	this is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses . the click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them . he gets lots of comments about how neat they are
0	i returned this biofeedback software and hardware . i was happy with amazon 's quick credit back to my credit card , but i found this purchase totally lacking . the games it had you play were boring and i would n't suggest buying this for doing biofeedback
1	i read in one of the magazines , that many stars in hollywood eat chocolate to lose weight . i thought , that was some kind of cruel joke , until i read that the chocolate they eat is with hoodia , but i could not find the name for those chocolates . i searched the internet , and was i happy to find chocoleans ! i was going out on a date to my favorite sushi place , and had one chocolean before i left the house . it worked ! i could barely finish two sushi 's and i felt soo full . now i eat one or two chocoleans a day with water or coffee , and eat soo much less ! i already lost two dress sizes , amazing . and , they are sooo delicious
1	this is exactly what i wanted -- the last 1 i bought is over 10 yrs old and still going -- i was afraid each day it would go out and could not find a replacement anywhere -- -you are a life -- i mean , hair saver ! ! diane in texa
0	i have to say i am disappointed , having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916 , which i felt gave me a good trim , i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon . the one i received was much cheaper in quality . the plastic guide is cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually , which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped . the guide shattered . there is no replacement for the 5-position guide for the 9916 i can find . now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom , or finding a razor that can survive real world use . on the plus side , the battery life on this razor is incredible .
0	the first one of these i received broke after 2 uses . target.com quickly sent a replacement at no charge , and now that one has broken after about 5 uses . very frustrating , because otherwise it seems like a good system
1	the magnet is solid , the frame wiggle perfectly to make it clic and fit just like the picture shows . lenses are clear and functional . however , they need to give a bit more space to accomodate larger heads , since it can get snug and this is not your usual glasses . notice that the frame encircles the head , making head size an issue . on the plus side- the glasses wo n't fall off when you bend forward , they stay around your neck after you unclick 'em , and they are functional
1	bought this for use by my husband while he was in a nursing home and i used it to shave and cut his hair with while he was there , no hair on him or pillows or sheets . this is wonderful for anyone that does not want a mess while trimming or cutting hair , i also used it on the tougher part of his beard . wonderful item
1	these never leak and are good enough to wear over night . this is the only diaper i buy
1	used to have a lot of liquid soap and shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids ... kids will be kids ... but now they really like having their own dispenser buttons to push . easy to mount and easy to use
1	very good ; very satisfying . interesting blend of flavors -- dried fruit , cocoa , chili . nothing dominates - all the flavors are well balanced to make it interesting to eat . i could n't eat one every day , but for an occasional meal replacement , it is very good . too high calorie to be a snack item , but it 's tempting
0	i bought it 15 days back and it broke when i am chopping onion.. but its great to cut soft vegetables and even carrot is also good.. but i couldnt cut onions as mentioned.. probably we have to buy the onions from them hahhahaha ... i dont suggest buying it for onions.. coz i bought only for onions so that i could save my tears
1	i purchased the sound therapy radio to take on a trip . my roommate is a snorer , and i figured i needed the sound . i tried it out at home and liked it . it has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use . the alarm and clock are added goodies for me as i was looking for a sound machine that was small and light enough for travel . it was a good buy for my purposes .
0	this is n't a bad dryer when it comes to convenience and travelling . however , the folding handle did eventually break and i had to modify it to hold it together . i have n't noticed any benefit from the ion control , mine and my wife 's hair get 's easily frizzled with this dryer , plus it takes a long time to dry in comparison to what others have claimed . the switch is definitely very difficult to use , there 's no way a person can use it with one hand . if you tried , you 'd end up dropping the thing . the fact that the off position is between the two speed settings is n't very good either because you push so hard to move the switch you simply move from high to low instead of to the off position . personally , i ca n't wait to find her a better one so i can tear this one apart for more interesting things . on the upside , after fixing the handle , it has worked without any real problems for 6 months
0	i 've been taking these for over 3 weeks.. i have not seen any new hair growth . i think that new hair that does grow will be stronger but this has not caused my hair to grow any faster . i would suggest just buying hair supplement vitamins from gnc or any other place you can find them . they are much less expensive
0	i had this for about 2 years , and was not impressed . it worked for a month or so , and since then , does nothing . if you fill it up with water , and then plug it in for several days , the water level never goes down . i 've tried cleaning it repeatedly , and tried various things to make it work , but apparently it 's just dead . it was a cheap product ; you get what you pay for
1	its a nice little trimmer and not cumbersome at all like the remington trimmers . it has a cheap little organizer but as long as your not rough with it , it shouldnt break . another benefit is that you can rinse all the attachments under hot water in addition to brushing the hair out prior to that to ensure a very clean trimmer . just remember folks this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razor..it will leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me . a man can still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing it to fine stubble . my shaving experience with this thing is pleasant ... it does not pull hairs which is very refreshing for a trimmer . the only other device i never had/have that problem with is my braun 360 complete ( parts of the year i shave , other parts of the year i trim ) . its a very nice package and efficient . the only drawback is that it seems fragile ... so be careful not to drop any part of this set
0	unfortunately total block did not work well with my rosacea sensitive skin . it caused my skin to become very red and irritated by the end of the day . i do n't doubt this is an excellent sunblock , just not for my rosacea sensitive skin . i use it now on my arms with no problems . i do feel it is very expensive for so little product so will not repurchase
1	i thought this was convenient and easy to use . seemed to give a pretty accurate reading .
0	i had this unit for about 6 months and it broke on me . if it had n't broke , i 'll give if 4 stars
1	first , this is a big and cumbersome ... . but second , this is the best foot spa . got it for the wife and had to try it myself . i am a wuss when it comes to super hot temps and i had to ease into the heat , it stayed hot the entire time . the jets were nice and the wireless remote is priceless ( just make sure its in your hand when you sit down so you do n't have to move an inch : ) ) . the rollers on the bottom are nice too . it gets loud when on high-jets mode , but nothing to grand . fast shipper , would recommend
1	i have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it . it is easy to use and clean i have only had to charge it once so far . even though this is my first electric shaver , it is a good deal for the money . it does n't shave as close as a razor but it 's close . i would recommend it or give it as a gift .
0	returned item , as was leaking all over . great product if amazon had packed it better , i could have used it
1	calvin klein 's obsession was one of the earliest releases in the designer fragrance craze , and it has since become a classic . obsession is a warm , earthy , sensual scent . there is no floral or sweetness to it ; rather , it has a musky , almost masculine quality with a bit of a vanilla note . the scent is gently seductive -- alluring enough for romance , but also subtle enough for everyday wear . in has excellent staying power , as it lingers on the skin all day long . although obession has all of the qualities i usually like in a fragrance -- i definitely prefer musky , spicy scents to more floral ones -- for some reason , obsession is not one of my favorites ; although i do enjoy wearing it on occasion , i actually prefer stealing some of my husband 's obession for men to wear for myself ! overall , however , obsession for women is a classic fragrance that i would definitely recommend
0	this product is great at exfoliating , not so great at hair removal . your skin will be silky smooth , but still have hair . the hair that is removed does n't stay gone long . and it 's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body . it will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product .
0	do n't waste your money on this size . go ahead and get the 19 x 39 towel . the absorbency is good but there 's no way it will fit around a head . also , i 'm not sure what to do with the snap that is attached either
0	these did nothing for me . ask your doctor about aphthasol , a prescription drug approved by the fda -- which means it 's passed rigorous government testing standards . aphthasol changed my life
1	this is a good little product . did not expect much , but in fact it helped me relax and fall asleep and stay asleep . - thank
1	this item is great . it holds shampoo and conditioner , or whatever liquids you need in the shower , and also has a handy basket that i use to keep the shower spray cleaner and my shaving cream . the handy hooks hold my razor and my washcloth . really cuts down on the clutter and puts everything in one place . however , i had to buy this item from another vendor because amazon kept delaying shipment . after the delays had exceeded a month , i finally cancelled my order and went elsewhere . good product , bad transaction
0	i just received my brush ( es ) hair dryer yesterday 3/9/07 ... tried it out today - for 5 minutes ... i absolutely hate it . it 's the worst , by far , hair appliance i 've ever owned . i guess you get what you pay for ... but i 've owned revlon products in the past , and this was absolutely the biggest waste of money . i can not return it , because the return cost would be too expensive , too much trouble , and i guess it will go in the dumpster . i hate it - do n't make the same mistake i made . one big problem is that the bristles are so lousy - not firm and does n't grip the hair . just take it from this written testimony - it 's a piece of junk
0	the scale is everything the manufacturer claims . however , with minimal use by one average sized adult , our scale lasted only about nine months . the balance part of the scale is very sound , but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components . i suspect that poor q will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere . today , my scale will not function unless i hold the batteries by hand ( not too practical when someone is standing on it ... ) . conclusions : * scale design is nice -- looks good . * construction of balance components is solid , glass is very strong . design and construction of the power unit ( battery ) is rather poor . * scale functions as advertised for a normal sized ( 80kg/175lb ) adult ... until the battery power clip dies . * buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections . hope this helps !
1	pedometer is great ! easy to use , accurate . highly recommend it
0	picked this up to try out because of the ratings price . did n't do a thing for me . wipe it on , let it haze and wipe it off . no difference .
1	i got this for my daughter for christmas . she loves it . she is able to do her nail easily . the nail attachments work really well and strong , the only thing the attachments for callous do not really work that well they have to be at a certain angle and work so so , but the rest of the attachments are excellent certainly worth the price for those alone.compact size , easy to store and quick charge time
0	this scale does not weigh correctly . your results depend upon exactly where you are standing on the scale when you are weighing in . i counted 6 different results within 5 minutes the last time i used it . this is one of the least accurate scales i 've ever used . spend the extra money to get a higher quality non-digital scale
1	i 've only used the kit once , and it did what it was supposed to . no problems , everything went fine , and i intend to use it again within about a month . it should pay for itself very quickly
0	lcd fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker was n't stong enough . anyhow , i could push it back . then , the scale could n't be turned on by tapping on the top . this is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual . i have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime ! i think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken . this is the problem i ca n't fix . the only thing i can do is sending it back . following up : according to the other review , i tried to make this scale `` vibrating '' using different ways of tapping . it did n't work no matter how hard i tried . i had to use my toe to lift up one side a little ( about half an inch ) and drop it on hard floor to make enough `` vibration '' to turn it on . i wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on . my soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping . i have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate . just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass . and also , be careful to use it in bathroom : moisture will make the glass surface slippery .
0	this pitcher is designed so that when you try to empty it -- pour out all the water -- the filter comes crashing out ! it 's top-heavy . i much prefer my dispenser that lives in the fridge . it may be clumsy to refill -- which is why i thought i 'd try a pitcher -- but it 's extremely easy to use
1	unfortunately , millions of americans currently suffer from the debilitating effects of stress , anxiety , and depression . in the pharmaceutical industry , anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are among the best-selling medications on the market . the everyday stressors faced by americans have simply become too much for many to bear , and reasonably so . in recent years , taking an anti-anxiety medication or antidepressant has become as common as taking a multivitamin . however , the side effects and long-term effects of such medications were for the most part unknown until recently . in the past year , some of the drastic negative effects of such medications have come to light , much to the horror of patients and physicians alike . anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants have been linked to addiction , severe withdrawal , weight gain , vertigo , and even suicide and death . to treat the symptoms of stress , anxiety , and depression , without negative health implications , many are now turning to natural supplements -- safely and with much success . most consumers are confused about which natural stress , anxiety , and depression supplements to take . fortunately , there are now a few promising natural supplements on the market which offer truly effective results , safely . the challenge lies in distinguishing the effective products from the one 's that are based more on marketing hype . it is critical that the product you choose contains those ingredients proven effective for treatment through clinical study , and that those ingredients are of the highest grade and included in the proper dosage in the product . this is the key to getting the results you desire - freedom from stress , anxiety , and depression . after researching nearly every available natural anxiety product on the market today i can tell you that many products contain low-grade ingredients in amounts far too small to be truly effective . there are a few , however , with clinical research behind them that also contain quality ingredients in efficacious doses . these products offer the definite potential to counter your emotional and physical responses to stress , anxiety , and depression . after review of the products and the available scientific literature only those products that met the criteria were recommended , here is a list of the top the top 10 stress , anxiety and depression supplements on the market today : 1 ) anxietol 7 ( tm ) 2 ) welatonin ( tm ) 3 ) pinadol ( tm ) 4 ) seredyn ( tm ) 5 ) prosera ( tm ) 6 ) amoryn ( tm ) 7 ) euphorx ( tm ) 8 ) herbval supra ( tm ) 9 ) clarocet-nri ( tm ) 10 ) relora ( tm )
0	thought this would work , should have known better.a pen light would do the same thing.do not waste your money , or you will look as silly as me.i returned the piece of jun
1	this was my heating pad , but my hairless cat took it over . he has a special pet heating pad of his own that he loved until he discovered this one . the first day i could n't pry him off . i love that it 's washable . in fact , i 'm getting a second one for him to use while the others in the wash. of course , i keep it pretty low for him . being able to choose the times for shutoff is nice too since a lot of heating pads shutoff in two hours and some days that 's not enough .
0	i was never able to use this mirror successfully due to its low light source . agree with other users -- this mirror was no better than an unlighted one .
1	i use it for the water pic function in addition to the sinus rinse tool i purchased . works great !
0	my husband purchased the pedometer with fm radio for me . i loved it and used it non-stop for about a week . after a week the battery case top fell off so i could not keep the batteries in . the fm radio worked only once - i thought i had a short in the headset . good idea but really did not perform/last for the money
1	flax is a plant . the seeds in the flax plant are filled with flaxseed oil , ( sometimes called linseed oil ) . the seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid ( ala ) and linoleic acid . ala is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed . flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids . flaxseed is nature 's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids , and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils , and it costs less , ounce for ounce . flax also contains other important substances like lignans , which may protect against some types of cancer . the husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage . both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties . there are many potential benefits from taking flax seed oil : flaxseed oil lowers cholesterol levels , thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis . flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens . these are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause . flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure . flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema , as it has anti-inflammatory properties . flaxseed may also reduce the itching , swelling , and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne . flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation . flaxseed reduces ldl ( low-density lipoprotein ) cholesterol ( the body 's `` bad cholesterol '' ) and lowers triglyceride levels . research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil . taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk . this is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks , which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer . new research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer . nature made flaxseed oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil , as the company is well-known and reputable . one tip : keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat , as both degrade the oil . the usual beneficial dose of flaxseed oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal . the benefits of flaxseed oil are cumulative . commit to taking it every day without fail . like any herbal supplement , do n't expect dramatic quick results . the results you get will be subtle at first and then build over time . for specific conditions such as rhematoid arthritis , exzema , psoriasis , acne , etc , . the results should be apparent in 4-8 weeks . be patient ! know that even if you do n't `` feel '' different , you are sill protecting your body from the harmfull effects of many disease conditions . jim `` konedog '' koeni
0	i had ordered this item expecting good things from it . however , the article has never worked properly . the electrical system seems to be working fine , but the uv light has never come on . somehow it seems pointless to have a toothbrush sanitizer that does not sanitize . right now the product is only a toothbrush holder ; nothing more . i generally do not pay such a high price for a toothbrush holder . i have been in contact with the producer of the product and hope to have something done about it . in short , i wo n't buy anything like this again
0	advil liquigels are excellent for headaches . i am writing this review to warn customers that this product from amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks ( as advertised ) . i ordered this product more than 2 months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped . it is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store ( like i had to eventually do when i ran out )
1	i purchased this dryer to replace an older one that is far too loud . while this new one is much quieter than the old one , it really is n't super-quiet . still , i have no complaints on the noise , but the flimsy wall mounting hardware is another story . the threaded holes in the mounting plate are extremely fragile , so much so that they both were wrung out during the initial mounting of the dryer . it did n't help any that the mounting holes were extremely hard to locate once the plate was mounted - it 's hard to see thru that white plastic shell . i ended up having to discard the original threaded screws and use two slightly larger metal tapping screws to mount the dryer to the bracket . this worked fine , but the original mounting hardware is n't very well designed in my opinion . other than that the dryer seems to work very well , although i have n't had it long enough to know how well it will last . all in all , i 'd give the dryer 4 stars out of 5
1	i 've been relying on this lotions for over a decade . of the many i 've tried , it 's the only one that provides both immediate dryness relief and long-lasting moisturizing . some may find the initial glycerin slickness to be excessive , especially on hands , but if you have skin as dry as mine you 'll tolerate a minute or two of `` greasiness '' for the softness and comfort that lasts for hours . these comments are for neutrogena emulsion only -- neutrogena body lotion did not work well for me
0	first of all , let 's talk about the noise level on this thing . yikes ! that should be against some kind of consumer protection law . the blowdryer part is ok , but did n't like the brushes at all . i 'll go back to my conair stying brush and my straightener . live and learn
0	the foot bath makes a mess with the water and does not keep the water warm . a lot more hassel than it is worth . sorry i spent my money on it
0	i was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back . however , immediately after opening the product , i tried to plug it in , as it does n't work without batteries being fully charged . unfortunately , this massager would plug in but did not start charging , and therefore , it could not be charged . i will be returning this item
0	the foil is abrasive and can cause razor bumps . also the shave is not close and will missed areas around my rear jaw line that my remington gets fairly easily . overrated and overpriced eurotrash .
1	this is a great barber-style setup ... it comes with a lot of guides and has a little case . they even give you a garbage bag . good dea
1	adds a great fragrance to the room . we bought several different scents and placed them throughout the house . it 's a different smell in every room . what a pleasant change from smelling the pets .
0	the bars look like mudpies , are very dry , and all three `` flavors '' taste the same , meaning that they do n't have much flavor at all . i much prefer certain flavors of balance bars . the only good thing about these clif bars is that i do n't get hungry for several hours after eating one
0	chair is not at all what it 's advertised as . does not massage just vibrates and makes you feel sick . compatible with sitting on a washing machine .
0	one-battery trimmers simply not strong enough , was glad to find a two-batteries version . it has a perfect design which will attract many more naive surfers like me . unfortunately it 's not good for nose hair trimming . problem is it makes electric-like unpleasant sensations when touches sensitive skin inside nose . so much that it makes you scared using it ; - ) it also does n't cut well , does n't reach inside , makes burning smell and overheated . update on 2/7/2007 : from my recent experience , the microtouch turbo is an excellent alternative which has no problems mentioned above . the only problem is its durability ( you may find yourself buying 2 per year ) but at the price below $ 10 this is not a real issue . good luck
0	i bought it new . after using this shaver a couple of times in a shower , it stopped working . i took it to a braun affiliated repair shop . braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior , including the electronics . they said this is not a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me . i checked the manual before i used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you can not use it in a shower . i have not opened the shaver , i have not cleaned it in water . thus , based on my experience , this shaver and braun are a scam as far as i am concerned
0	i saw a commercial , i read a reviews - and so i bough one box at walmart . it 's not worth it , that 's my conclusion . the trays are made of very thin plastic-like material , and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth . the active gel easy goes out of trays , and fills your mouth . during first couple od uses , after 20 min or so i started to feel a vague pain in my gum . nevertheless , i continued using the product for all 7 days , as advertised , 30 min a day . after the whole package was gone , the change of color of my teeth is barely visible . i hope you will have better luck .
0	maybe it 's my own fault , but i did n't get that from the product description . it 's a weensy little thing for using on your desk at work or taking with you on business trips ; in my apartment it barely lasts through one night . it 's also really noisy . i am probably comparing to my last ( normal sized ) humidifier ( a vicks something or other , no longer available ) which was great and lasted 3 years , until hard water built up too much limescale ... i would have cleaned more if i 'd have realized how hard it is to find one to replace it
0	bell harrah is so right ! this things is indeed garbage ! i have been using this things since march 9 , 2005 and there is very little difference in my hair . it still breaks , for goodness sakes , and where is the hard nails that is also suppose to result from using these pills ? ! it makes me wonder what the hell this thing is doing to my body , as it has not helped my hair and this month of may makes it 4 months i have been using . you 're suppose to see some huge changes within a month to 45 days , and not one damn thing has happened ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! and the pills are so damn expensive ! . i really do n't have $ 57 to throw a way a month , so when you spend that amount of money you are really hoping that something will work . i agree with the previous reviewer-do n't waste your money
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase , so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled . when i read `` chocolate pecan pie '' .. i expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate , with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base . what i received was a bar with little taste , nothing at all similar to the name on the bar . in my opinion , the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it ... the flavor is barely there . the bar is dry . it is never again be on my `` purchase '' list
1	i 've owned two thermaphore heating pads , different sizes , for many years and i 'm using one right now ! they 're quality made to last a lifetime . they trap moisture from the air so no need for soaking sponges to insert . the trigger switch allows you to heat as needed as hot as you like and if you fall asleep there are no worries of burns..if the trigger is n't depressed it is n't heating . i would n't be without mine . it helps me manage my arthritis/fibromylagia/nerve damage pain . i 've recommended it to many of my friends who have been very pleased as well .
0	this pad works , basically , but it does turn itself after 30 minutes . there 's no way to prevent that . this may be fine for some uses , but it 's very inconvenient for others
0	this one 's going back to the store . it has been turned on for almost half an hour and i barely feel the heat . if you ask me , my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat . as for the `` massage '' , it 's worthless to me , but i am not one for vibrating massage anyway , i prefer shiatsu . i get cold feet when i am home and not moving around a lot , so i think i will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet
0	i made the mistake of buying this light to treat my acne without first talking to my dermatologist about it . after just using it three times my acne became more out of control than it had in years -- my face broke out in places it had never broken out before . it took me two months of using medication from my doctor to get my acne under control . i would not recommend using this device unless a doctor says it would work for you
1	daughter was very pleased when she received it unexpectedly , after her good news ! she 's very picky also ... just loved the quality and organizational value of the set ! very nicely packaged . would highly recommend
0	these did not suppress my appetite , though many days i took 3 tablets three times a day ! had very good luck with a bottle of dytrexil ( also a hoodia product ) , but the next bottle of that , nothing . i guess like crops , you can get good batches and bad batches . these struck me as a bad batch . as one reviewer said , i actually felt hungrier many days . egad ! better luck next time ! sigh
1	great price , free shipping ... .basically ... i love it ! ! i placed my order on sunday and got it 8:00 a.m. tuesday morning ... i highly recommend this seller ... i will definitely continue to buy from this seller myself..
1	i have been using source of life energy shake for many years . i recommend one scoop in 8 oz . of orange juice or milk twice a day . basically , i pour the milk in a shaker cup and put the scoop on top , close the shaker and shake for a few seconds . this stuff tastes great and has loads of healthy vitamins , herbs , minerals , and more ! a few months ago , i actually used this drink to cut down on my starbuck 's daily double shot of expresso ! guess a source of life starbucks latte would be great , maybe i 'll try that someday ! this product deserves more than 5 stars and it is absolutely a great product in every way . if you are looking for a healthy energy drink that tastes good , you have found it
0	the adjustable slider combs are horrible and i found the conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me . i can not get it to cut the hair on my husband who likes it very short , it would not even take any hair off . all it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery . i thought this was the best brand out there , but conair beats them by a mile . i think i will take it back and get a refund and go buy a conair with the money .
1	i looked a many other back support pads . some were too big , and others were just complicated . the obus forme side to side is perfect . it is very light weight and small , therefore , very portable . i use it in the car and take it with me to the office . the strap on the back fits well around any chair back , although , i have found i do n't need to use it because it stays put
0	it should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator ! i 'm not talking about the muscle relaxing kind ; i 'm talking about the sexually stimulating kind . once you remove the plastic prongs that are designed to relax the head/neck , the base is an approximately 5 inch vibrator . just be forewarned , customers , this item is not for the easily offended
1	easy to use . short time to recharge the baterie . long life batery and it is appropriate o sensitive skin
0	i was excited to try these because i liked the idea of getting my son something that let him put his legs together . i am tired of seeing him so bowlegged due to the diapers . and since i like the other huggies styles , i was very enthused . until i went through 5 diapers , everyone of which leaked . leaking of urine was the biggest problem but after a bm came out the legs , i gave up . i tried everything possible to make these work , but they leak . maybe in the smaller sizes , but size 5 on a 22 month old definitely did not work . also , my son is in 50 % percentile for height and weight , so skinny legs were not the problem . no more natural fit/hugflex for us
1	i'am very satisfied with the vidal sassoon hairdryer . there are 3 heat settings and tips in the enclosed booklet on how to use these settings . it is a little bulky but it does n't take long to get used to a larger dryer . i would recommend this hair dyer
0	i 've got this meter a month ago . i intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise , but i 've never been able to do so ! at rest , the meter gives a reading after several attempts , but often inaccurate . you have to stay still as a statue for 10-20 seconds to get a reading . now i 'm using it as an exercise watch/stopwatch
0	used it once and put it in the dogs ' tub . it 's really awkward to use . it sucks up your water pressure , too . ca n't figure it out . i have incredible water pressure , but with this thing on , it went down to nothing . stick to the original shower massage by waterpik
1	old spice classic is far and away the best deodorant i 've ever used . it goes on clean , unlike those `` powdery '' white deodorants . it also has a great fragrance and longevity after application . i think a lot of that is due to the high alcohol content ; if you look at the ingredients , you 'll see that alcohol is listed first . in fact , the container sports a `` flammable '' warning . the alcohol really does work well to contain odor . alcohol-based deodorants are pretty hard to find , so i 'm thankful this product is still being made
0	maybe my toenails are just too thick , but this cutter just is not heavy duty enough to cut them ... i threw them away upon first use . my old toenail cutters were the same design but i do n't know who made them ... they worked fine ... heavier duty metal and much sharper . these are junk imho
0	i would have given it zero stars but that is not an option . it stopped working after about 10 minutes of static filled reception . it was difficult to get a station . and it was not a problem with the batteries . run , do n't walk , *away* from this
1	i am very happy with the emjoi compact epilator that i purchased . it does exactly what it claims to do and works wonderfully . until i asked a salon for advice on the best way to remove unwanted facial hair , i did n't even know something like this exhisted . i just wish i would have known about this product years ago . a. davis
1	if you are trying to learn relaxation through biofeedback , this is the product to buy . packaging , support , presentation , and hardware/software quality are the best that i have seen . no down side . it 's not a game in the usual sense . more of a way to learn techniques in a quiet and amusing way . there is room for a little mischief . instead of allowing the balloons to flow smoothly , i tried busting a few . type a personality shows through occasionally . i will be purchasing the next item in the series . i am learning to relax , at will , which will be helpful in my high-stress occupation . good luck
0	i had heard that chocoleans were effective , but i was very disappointed . they taste good , but did n't satisfy my hunger or my sweet tooth . about the same as eating a piece of dark chocolate . i wound up gaining weight while using these
0	i was pretty excited to try an ion hairdryer . i got this one because i liked the idea of being able to 'control ' the amount of ions coming out . my hair did seem a little shinier after using it ( the only reason i gave it two stars and not one ) but my hair felt a little drier . almost straw-ish ... it never felt like that with my old drier . also the buttons really are hard to switch ... all of them ! i read another review that said that and i thought well how bad can it be ? i dry my hair with a round brush in my right hand and the dryer in the left . i turn the dryer on and off during different times while i am doing my hair . with this dryer i could not turn the on/off switch with my left hand . i had to put down my brush and use both hands . i could not believe how hard it was to switch ! this was the main deciding factor in returning the dryer , it was so frustrating not to be able to switch it easily with a flick of your thumb . not to mention made me feel like a big wussy ! ! ! the speed setting only has two settings , low and high . the low setting was way too low and the high setting was way too high . a middle ground would have been nice . lastly , the dryer smelled a little weird . granted , i only had it two days before i returned it , so the smell might eventually disappear . but it was n't your normal 'new hairdryer , hot plastic ' smell . it was almost a slight mildew smell . yuk . so , i would not recommend getting it . i exchanged it for the vidal sassoon ion sensor dryer . that seems to be working better . the low speed setting is perfect . the smell is normal 'new dryer ' smell so far . the buttons are easy to push ! ! ! ! the sensor ( it automatically turns off when you pur it down ) is a little off , it takes a while to turn off . but all in all i like it . and it also does make my hair shiny and does not make it feel drier or like straw !
0	after using the dryer ( which i liked very much and did a quick job ) , i discovered that my hair was being ruined . it would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces . i stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair . i would like to return it and get my money back ! ! !
0	pros : it 's really cheap , and has a lot of features ( set stride length , calories , clock , backlight , protective door ) con : the door is really , incredibly , intolerably hard to open . i was adding a dozen steps to the readout just trying to get the door open . i tried to trim the plastic tab , but i took too much off , now the door flops open . it was useless the way it came from the factory , now i broke it and ca n't use it at all without a rubber band to keep it closed . also , i was never able to get a very accurate step-count . i would count 100 steps and usually get 65-90 steps on the readout , though i 'm not really sure because i had to shake the thing for a minute or two just to get the door open . for the price , i think this would be a great deal for someone with the patience to work with it
0	these item i purchase on 2/21/07 i used only for 3 week and it broke i do not kwon if i can return or not to have my money back or replace with anothe
0	the brush completely feel apart prior to using it . i sent a review to the company with no response . the wooden back fell off of the handle and then the loofah fell off of the backing . if i would have had some response from the company offering some recourse i would not have been this dissatisfied
0	i expected so much and yet recieved so little from these so called batteries . number one , i was disappointed to find out , after some scientific analyses i performed on them , that duracell 's world famous copper top statement is erroneous . this so called copper top is nothing more than a copper-aluminum alloy called copposyclamatrane . i ca n't top the copper top ? hardly . after the analyses , i put these copper top batteries to the test . what i did was i stuck them in my flashlight expecting a brilliant flashlike-like sheen . what i got was far from . a tiny light that could only be classified as much less than miniscule . i threw the flashlight at my cat in disgust , expecting hilarious results , and i was n't disapointed ! this was the only good thing that came out of the worst purchase decision i 've ever made . thanks for nothing , dura-hell
0	i used this cream for three weeks , two times a day and it did make some part of my circles lighter- from brown it went to pink . but i skipped one day and it all went back . you pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day
0	yes , that 's right . this worked for me for only one day . what a disappointment
1	after reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the luna bar flavors , i decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself . i noticed that the luna bar toasted nuts 'n ' cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil . if you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor . the toasted nuts 'n ' cranberry flavor is delicious , does n't taste like a candy bar , and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages . luna bar toasted nuts 'n ' cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market .
1	this would be a great item except it is n't clear that it only works on handles that are pointing to the right . our doors have the handles going to the left leaving this item useless for us
0	some products lead to real improvement of your skin ( retin a , exfoliators ) while others simply cover up the imperfections acting like a make up . the sad and hillarious thing is that most consumers mix up makeup effects with real skin improvement . the regenerist contains silicones that fill in small wrinkles and mattify the skin surface thus acting like an invisible makeup . such effects lead most consumers to believe their crow 's feet are smaller . if you really want to do a test , you should stop using the product for a few days using only face wash . if during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the product works . you ca n't really claim the wrinkles are smaller while the product is on your face covering them hello ... . and another thing , a wrinkle ca n't be erased in one or 3 weeks - the skin does n't produce collagen that fast ( unless you cut it ) . paying $ 18 / 1.7 oz ( retail price , its cheaper on amazon but you have to pay shipping price ) for a silicone makeup is a little steep for me provided that there are cheaper products on the market that will make your skin look equally good cause they contain the same silicone base even better - try monistat soothing care - chafing relief powder gel 1.5 oz , $ 7 at cvs . i have been using matrixyl ( the active peptide in regenerist ) for 6 months in my own formulations ( without silicones ) and frankly speaking have n't noticed any improvement in my crows feet or the lines on my forehead . currently there is only one study of the effects of matrixyl conducted by sederma - the manifacturer of matrixyl which makes me quite suspicious about the whole story ...
1	over the years , i have tried many different brands and types of heated rollers and i never liked using any of them . i recently bought a new set which i had to return due to the fact that i had a terrible time trying to roll my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then after clipping the rolls , they would immediately fall out of my hair ... .scream ! i bought the remmington # 1080n wax core roller set and i have finally found the easiest and quickest way to curl my hair . the rollers surface , when warm , grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair . the rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair . once heated , the rollers are relatively cool to the touch ( no more burned fingers ) but due to the wax core , the rollers hold plenty of heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent , long lasting results . the set takes about 10 - 15 minutes to warm up . i 've found the warm up time takes longer than the time i actually leave the curlers in my hair . this is the best curler set i have ever used . if i was to ask for one change , it would be a quicker warm up time . however , just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy , makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation . i 'm hard to please , so my recommendation says alot . thanks remmington ( i still do n't like your other regular rollers ! ha )
1	the product smells really good , is very affordable and helps maintain my hair style all day . i highly recommend trying it . i will make it part of my daily hairdress ( grooming ) for life !
1	this is the best shaver i 've ever used . it shaves closer and quicker than the many norelcos i 've used , all of which costed a lot more than the r-960 . the only improvement i 'd like to see is in the battery , which does not really maintain its strength well between charges
0	does n't show you what station you are listening to . it starts over at 88.9 every time you shut it off . by the time you scan a few stations , it stops getting a signal and you have to start off at 88.9 , again .
1	this mabis steam inhaler really puts out the steam ! i am very satisfied and would heartily reccommend this item to anyone looking for a steam inhaler
0	i got this as a gift for christmas , and i 've tried it twice so far . both times i get the same result - it does n't work . i understand that with wet hair , it wo n't dry it , obviously . but even with damp hair , as instructed , it does n't get my hair dry . as for the actual straightening aspect , i still end up with frizzy hair that is n't even all that straight . it 's not worth the money - spend the extra bucks and get a chi or infrashine , you 'll be a lot better off
0	this can not be the real thing . the scent does n't last 5 minutes . what a waste of $ 50.00 . i am so disappointed .
0	this shaver only works on short or fine hair . if your hair is long ( more than 1/4 inch ) or coarse , it just skips over the hair and does n't do anything . i 've thrown it away and gone back to disposable razors
1	as expected , the new 7180xl razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave , even though it runs much slower than earlier models . the slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy . just 2 noticable disappointments : 1 . the external power supply is a rather combersome change from former norelco products . 2 . the exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome `` feature '' of an otherwise good product at a premium price
0	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use . they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on . the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me . every head is different , so maybe they 'll work better for you
0	for the price you cant beat this product , if the problem i 'm experiencing can be solved . i bought two of these brushes , one for my home bathroom and one for my work-out bag . love the price and timer feature ... but it seems that once i 've used up the power in the brush , it wont recharge properly . i 'm experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long i leave it in the charger . if there is a simple fix for this then i 'd say 5 stars . if not , then 2 stars is well earned , seeing as how i 've been on their support line waiting ( as i type this ) for over an hour
0	tried this product for 2 weeks ; it did improve the clarity and softness , but i found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well , seemed to have a sticky feel . since then , i found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called microdermx by nikkel holistic skincare . this product performs like magic ; it is not too scratchy and i can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like i 've been slapped with a wire brush . i can do the treatment 2-3x 's a week , ( like your supposed to ) but i also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before . it is a magical product . bette hampton , chicago , i
0	i got this humidifer for my daughter 's bedroom . she loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time , then automatically shut off . tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail . i had to return it . however , i did buy the penguin shape for my 2nd daughter 's room and that one works great .
1	just received this massager and my wife and i ca n't stop massaging each other with it . especially great deal for the special amazon price . i 've been wanting one of these for years because i can hardly feel those little hand held ones ( that just fit in the palm of your hand ) . glad i splurged . only problem is that amazon site says `` 7 heads '' , item description says `` 6 heads '' , and actul product only included 5 heads . the one missing , from the picture on the box , is the `` acu point '' heads . i 'm guessing that 's why it 's on sale ? still worth it if you get it on sale . great massager .
1	my wife and i have used this a few times now and really like it . from a novice 's point of view , this is a great meditation aid . i like being able to get the visual feedback as i calm and center myself . i guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as i try to accomplish the task in front of me . it 's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack
0	i finally got this toothbrush after i have seen alot of people use them . i am very disappointed . the design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky . it 's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste . it 's very hard to clean . it 's loud , and small brush . not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive . no thank you
0	i am in my early 30 's and never had a problem with acne until my mid 20 's . i had been using proactiv for quite some time ( 5 years or so ) and it worked pretty well . i say pretty well since it did clear my face some , but my face has not been totally clear in a long time . along comes acnefree which is `` better '' than proactiv since you can buy it locally and it contains more of the active ingredient -- cool , i am sick of ordering it online and it is cheaper ! well , i guess you get what you pay for -- i do n't consider myself to have particularly sensitive skin , but i used acnefree one time in the morning . so far so good -- until 2 am the next morning when i broke out in hives all over my entire body . so no more acnefree for me , just wanted to give my experience for anyone who might be in the same situation
1	this is a great tool . this help people to get back on track `` physically '' . it is hard to find effective training tools . this one is great for those who need back door training . simple to use and rock hard ! up yours
0	this thing did not survive the unpacking , inserted the battery put the housing back and bent a plastic doohicky in the inside . not worth it
1	product is exactly what you would expect . i have been using it for 2 months 3-5 times a day with great success . i would buy it again knowing how well it works
0	i have not recieved the vitamins ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! lost in the mail ? ? ? ? ? ? please let me know what i can do , it has been a month
0	my biggest issue with this shaker is that it does n't seal properly around the threaded part of the cap . even if i really tighten it up , i still get a small leak when i shake it . also , the cap for the mouthpiece pops off pretty easy . but overall it gets the job done , and having fluid graduations on the side are nice
0	i used relacore for one week ... ..it did n't work the only thing it helped with was sleeping . the bottle says take one with each meal and i did by 3pm daily i was fighting to keep my eyes open . if you need help sleeping this is one too take . also i put on 3 pounds
0	i agree with the reviews from the other reviewers . it basically ruined my nails the first time i used it . however what i did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed . after trimming their claws you often get rough edges . i now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short . they do n't seem to mind it becuase it is very quiet . i must state that i will never again use this product for my own nails
0	i just bought this small fountain for my office at work thinking that the soothing sound of water would be a nice addition . however , after setting it up , i added the water and the waited and waited and waited to hear the cascading sound of water . no cascading sound . i added more water -- nothing ... i added less water -- absolutely nothing . the design is built such that the water moves down without making any noise . it is useless from that perspective ... plus , you can tell it is made of plastic so it is n't really that nice to look at either . i would definitely not buy this again and am contemplating getting rid of it after 1 week of use
0	i bought two clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself . although the product works well , unfortunately , both brushes were defective . the trouble started occurring about two months after using . one brush started out with two speed settings , but eventually only functioned at the low setting . the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible . they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty . be careful if you are going to travel abroad . the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !
0	i am a reviewer and i was checking out this 'sleep aid ' when it struck me as strange that almost every review for this product sounds like a promotion of the product , not a review , and note that the reviewers have only one review ( click on their 'see all my reviews ' ) . beware of this shoddy marketing ploy . this 'crud ' alone merits my one star rating . amazon needs to censor these reviews
0	the straightener works ok . it straightens my hair better when it is dry . i have very course hair . i still had to blow dry it to get it to straighten out , and go over it a few times to really make it straight . the remington is to thick , so you can not style the hair at all with it . the worst part about this particular straightener is when i leave it plugged in and have it shut off it keeps making a beeping sound ? ? i have to unplug it to make it stop . i just bought a chai straightner for about three times the cost of this , it is only 1 inch thick so it styles the hair very nice , but it straightens my hair the same as the remington . i have only had it a few weeks , so i am intrested to see if the chai causes less damage as it claims then other straighteners
1	i 've been using this for the last 3 months and i 'm a very satisfied customer . i get a very close shave , and no razor bumpors . i 'm afircan american and my beard is coarse and curly , sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown hair problems . i highly recommend this , because it 's a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as braun and norelic . it 's very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil . i cam across these because the only time i would get a great shave was at the barber . when he used clippers on me i 've never had any problems with ingrown hair , therefore i decided to own my own pair of clippers . i 'm very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming
0	i went through 3 of these in less than 2 months . after about 2-3 weeks of use , the first two dryers would n't shut off when the switch was placed in the `` off '' position ; the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off . the 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks . i definitely do not recommend buying this product
1	this is my first electric shaver and i am very pleased with the results . use the trimmer to reduce the length of the hair and then use the cleancut to `` make it smooth '' . no knicks no cuts ! ! ! i am pleased !
0	i recommend that you not buy this product through the mail . my three boxes leaked all over the amazon box . yuck
0	i bought this for a far-sighted relative , but it did n't magnify enough , and was distractinly blurry , so the gift was n't well received . i give this two thumbs down
0	like many other negative reviews , i 've experienced the same problems with this razor . i guess less blades is more and i 'm going back to the m3 power . i 'll be brief about the problems : 1. there 's more `` pulling '' when you shave . it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut . 2. the razor is harder to clean off . 3. i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn . 4. it 's more expensive than other better razors out there . so there you have it . if you have to try it out , hey it might work for you . but please , keep your receipt ( and packaging ) in case you want to get a refund . * * if you 're reading this is 2009 , chances are that gillette 's money back guarantee will no longer be around . however , there will probably be a gillette razor with 12 blades by then
0	i bought this product and the accuracy depends on having good test strips . i simultaneously had bloodwork at the doctor 's office when i did the test . except for the total cholesterol , all the other tests were off . the manual states to check for the blue color at the back of the test strips after the test is done . except for total cholestrol the other test strips did not have a blue color . the test strips which are expensive were bad . i am planning on returning this produc
0	it 's ok that helps to moisturize the skin , but it 's just stays oily and can not be absorbed appropriately in the skin .
1	i am diabetic and i have been losing about 10 lbs per month for 6 months eating these bars as a between meal source of protein . they satisfy my taste for something sweet and are filling .
0	i got this product after seeing the ads on tv for possibly the hundredth time . i need to clean dirty fingerprints off my cabinets . i opened the package . followed directins exactly and got nothng for my troubles . i used the first sponge in the package . it got less than half a cabinet door clean before it started breaking apart in my hand . i was willing to accept that the first one was possibly defective but not the second one . it cleaned an area smaller than the size of a quarter before it started coming apart in my hand . i was n't even pressing very hard . i 'll stick to my sponges with the scrubbing pads for cleaning my cabinets and other things around my house . i 'm a little ticked that this did n't last for one good cleaning let alone one good minute .
0	would work great , except ... this does n't fit my new waterpik ultra ( wp-100 ) .
0	this shaver is ok but has an electronic problem . i get clean shave with little bit of effort but , my main problem is with on/off button . just after using this for 3-4 months my shaver on/off button stopped working . it is always in on position i ca n't switch off the razor . the only way it switches off is when the battery runs out
1	i never thought the world would get here . i am actually spending time to type up a review , online , for shaving lotion . well , here you go : for every man out there who is interested and who has ever used an electric shaver , if you have n't tried the norelco cool skin electric shaver with this lotion , you have to . whoever has sensitive skin , you need to switch to this , because it does a great job . that 's all i have to say and i wo n't waste anymore time
0	i 'd give it 0 starts if that was an option ! a total piece of crap ! try cleaning it , and the head falls apart ! try putting it back together , and plan on doing nothing else for a long time ! do not buy this razor
0	i bought this hairdryer and it worked really well for one week , but then it just died on me . one week
1	very handy that you can put it in your handbag wherever you go . you can use it to read those tiny words in the label when you are grocery shopping . better than magnifier glass because the width of this bookmark covers the whole line of a page
0	this item worked well for a month or so , but then began working intermitently after that . eventually it stopped working all together . in my opinion it is a pretty cheaply made item . i would not recommend it
1	works great , no problems after 4 months
0	it does n't do what it 's supposed to do . this gizmo is supposed to clean out the pores and generally clean up the skin on your face . did n't work for me
0	i hate this product . i receive it as a gift , and all the products are not adapted for babies , plus , looks very cheap !
0	i will never purchase another neutrogena product , again . there products are dangerous ! ! ! it burned my face . my face is all red , swollen , red , irritated , and itchy . my new best friend is cortizone 10 , the anti itch cream . it 's been a week since i stopped using netrogena , and i still look horrifying ! ! ! ! perfect for halloween , right ? but , halloween is over , and i still look scary . this product has aged me ! ! ! it has caused a ton of wrinkles from where the skin is puffy and swollen . never , again , neutrogena ! ! !
0	these wipes were much thinner than i expected/remembered . i had to use at least 3 at a time . i wo n't buy these again
1	received the monitor quickly . it works well . the automatic feature is great .
0	the off-on switch on this product is very difficlut to use . i am not able to turn off or on with one hand and find it very difficult to turn on with two hands .
1	clif bars have been part of my families life for a long time and provides a good quick meal or snack depending on your activity level . definitely recommend having water available
0	too difficult to program , have had 2 weeks and still have not been able to complete process , instructions stay on screen too short a time , all i am able to get is weight , can not see other information on screen unless on floor and right on top of it , would send back but too much of a hassel and expense , too expensive for a scale that is only to give me my current weigh
0	this product does not work if you have soft blonde hair . my hair is not coarse and this razor just glided right over top with out cutting a thing . it 's comfortable to hold and seems like it is made well , but it is definatly not for those of us with soft hair .
1	just as it advertised , it is soft and dries up hair and body quickly . i bought it because it was on sale and thought why not try it out , well , i am sold on this product . only drawback now is the high price tag..
1	like the product very much . comfortable and convenient . i would recommend then if : you have a small hat size , do n't mind carrying around an odd shaped soft carrying bag . with the above i do n't have a problem . the most distracting problem is your eyes sweat inside the foam enclosed , goggle like eye pieces on warm days . i 've thought about cutting vents in the foam around the eye , but have not done this as of jan,2007 . i like them very innovative
0	top of the line ( april 2005 ) d-cell nimh batteries have 11,000 mah compared to this one 2,200 mah ( they cost 16 bucks but 10,000 mah battery costs six bucks ) . top of the line aa nimh batteries have capacity of 2500 mah . top of the line nicad d-cell batteries have 5000 mah capacity ( costs around five bucks ) . i thought that nimh was more capable than nicad . true , but not in this case . so what are we gettting here ? higher aa battery capacity in d-cell case . this battery is overpriced for what it delivers .
0	i got the fusion razor in the mail a few weeks ago so i decided to give it a try . at first it seemed ok , but i started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than my mach 3 turbo . i decided to experiment and shave half of my face with a mach 3 turbo and the other half with the fusion . from my experience , the mach 3 turbo gave a closer shave , and glided much smoother across my skin than the fusion . i think the 5 blades on the fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else . and as cool as the single trimming blade is , it seems like gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of having 5 blades . in other words , the single blade is a fix rather than a feature . my call is if your using a mach 3 turbo , do n't waste your money on the fusion
1	this is a truly amazing deal from amazon , where i also received free priority mail shipping . the photo does not display all that you will get . you will receive 6 boxes of q-tips cotton swabs , totaling an ammazing 3,500 q-tips in all . i will never ever have to purchase another q-tip as long as i live ! ! ! ! ! what a fantastic deal from amazon !
0	the lotion does not get very warm and only the lotion in the uppermost part of the dispenser gets warm . so if you want to use a lot of lotion , you have to wait in between while the lotion warms up . i have dry skin so i put lotion all over . its more of an inconvenience to have to wait for each application to warm up and even when it does warm up , it is n't super warm .
1	i 've been using regenerist daily for 6 months . i added the peel system this past month . what a change ! i 'm 60 . my skin has clarity i have n't seen in years . pores close up , small lines and wrinkles really do seem to disappear . i 'll stick with this from now on
0	after reading several comments i tried to proof my scale is working properly . however , like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant . i weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings . like some one else i even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands . the scale gave me several readings for the same amount of weight . now ! a digital scale is supposed to be percise..
0	pedometer part is fine . radio part is useless
1	this is the best shaver i have ever owned and i wish it was still available
1	yo nunca habia usado una afeitadora electrica y al comprar esta hice una excelente inversion porque me deja la piel practicamente lisa , muy suave y lo mejor de todo no tengo que usar agua . le dura la bateria y se limpia muy facilmente con el cepillito que trae . si compras el polvo de remington que ellos recomiendan es mucho mejor porque la afeitadora se desliza con mas suavidad . saludos rafael desde cabimas venezuel
1	it is a great product and makes my husband 's face as smooth as a baby 's you know ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
0	this product is not good at all i had to return mine after only 2 weeks . i found out that it is really inaccurate and it does n't work when you want it to . as for as the body fat percentage i could n't even get it to work . do not buy this product
0	i had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews . i used the razor as directed in the instruction manual . the manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use . i used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse . i had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal . do not buy this product
1	i started taking anxietol 7 to help me with my stress at work . i am not usually a stressed out sort of person however i recently got transfered to nyc and i 'm from utah , just that move itself is enough to stress anyone out . i am working as a trader and it is very high energy . anxietol 7 is helping me cope with my new life here
0	design seems flawed a bit for the container . when you pull the cord out , it bumps the tank off sometimes . the tank also seems a little loose when mounted . i tried the newest ultra dental water pik type , but it only lasted 1 month then began to leak water
1	now that i 'm writing this review , it seems silly that i 'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i had my first ( and hopefully only ) root canal and crown four years ago , something which i never again want to experience in my life ( as someone else described , it was painful and expensive ) . growing up , i did n't take care of my teeth like i should 've , so i 'm accustomed to always being told there 's either a cavity , or the start of one , and having to have more work done . after the root canal , my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations/oscillations , because that 's what she 'd been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , and it was affordable . when i first started using it , my gums were very sensitive to it , but that quickly wore off , so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums . it is also much easier to get behind the front teeth . subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one ( i honestly do n't remember if she has this exact model , but ours are similar ) , and i 've not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . as far as cleaning the unit to keep it from `` gunking '' up , i 'm the only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in , not dripping into the storage container ; so i do n't know how to combat that . but i just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it , then rinse the hand-held part , and set them back on the unplugged charger/base ( i only plug it in when the battery runs low ) and things stay clean with no problem
1	easy to use ; and a wicked incentive to lose weight . have lost 20 kilos in just a few months from walking .
0	this stuff does not work at all ! i tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that did n't have negative feedback , save yourself money and do not buy this product . it looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lenses
1	this is easy to use and set up . it even has a 3rd space for a guest . you do n't have to get your body fat and water each time . i like it
1	i love this product ! i deal with a lot of stress ( dont ' we all ) and was feeling edgy and nervous all the time . i couldnt ' even enjoy my grandkids . since i started taking calm advantage those feelings are gone and i can relax and enjoy life again . i would definately recommend it to anyone
0	the charlatans who makes this [ ... ] deserve to be shot and so does anybody stupid enough to buy it . eat a balanced diet and get some exercise . do n't be a moron all your life .
1	out of all the hair striaghters i have owned and i have gone through about 6 this is the best one yet ! i really like it ! it straightens my hair perfectly , and you cant beat the price
0	there are two thing that i do n't like about this set . the curlers get too hot to handle and the lid is n't attached to the base which is very inconvenient . i would n't recommend them
0	i purchased this humidifier , and it worked wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about a week . one night , it just stopped producing that humidifying mist and could not be coaxed into working again . i called the company , who told me to promptly cut the cord and throw it out , and they would be sending a new one to replace it ( with no cost for shipping to me ) . i received the new one a week later , which to my disappointment , did not have the nightlight feature . i also noticed it was from a different brand company . i ca n't remember the name but it also began with the word `` sun . '' so far , the new humidifier is working fine ( about 2 weeks now ) , but it has a lower water capacity so i have to refill it every night ( vs. every 2 nights with the original one ) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment . the process of replacing , however , was very smooth and also free so i 'll give them 2 stars for that
0	i 've tried this razor for 5 weeks , both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that i 've ever used . it does n't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble . i should have bought a new norelco instead of this . my old norelco always shaved me close . this panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor , or to be used in a pinch . but for a close shaving everyday razor , this is n't the one to buy . oh well , i waited too long to send it back
1	there are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments . i weighed both before i made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments . i am glad i did . the light from the mirror is bright , the slide bar for the different light settings works very well . if you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time . i enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use . the only negative i have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but i am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out .
1	i had a horrible cold , felt like complete # # # # but i had to work . this little two ounce vitamin b shot knocked the crappy feeling outta me and i was able to get some work done . there really is no crash and the taste is n't that bad . ..it tastes like a melted freeze pop . note : it may give you the jitters if you drink it on an empty stomach
1	the bad news first : does n't seem to work well without adding extra detergent it seems like this is not 3x concentration , and like others we found we had to compensate by adding more detergent than the directions said to get the same results as we did with the standard formula . otherwise , the two products , 'concentrated ' and 'standard srength ' are the same . make no mistake about it - this is concentrated comes out like heinz ketchup : it does seem to be concentrated , and we did notice a certain amount of difficulty getting the detergent out of the bottle , kind of reminded us of heinz ketchup . 4-star or 5-star product ? the standard strength product is clearly a 5-star product , however owing to the fact that this product does not work as well without adding more detergent than the direction claim , it rates 4-stars with our family . trying to learn objective info on laundry detergent is well . . . . the following is true of this product in standard strength or 3x with extra detergent added : i am allergic to most laundry detergents , but this product has prevented severe discomfort for me for about 10 years . it is consistently among the lowest-priced detergents available . in addition to being very easy on clothes and skin , it does work quite well in the stain-removal department and can be used as its own presoak . this is good to know if you are like me and are trying to avoid allergens . it is important to remember that if you buy a hypoallergenic powder detergent instead of a liquid like this , you may have to pre-soak stains and you wo n't have a hypoallergenic liquid with which to do it . while `` tide '' and `` cheer '' are also available in hypoallergenic formulas , [ `` tide free '' is actually just unscented ] they are considerably more expensive and work no better in my experience . that 's why i like this `` all liquid detergent - free clear , laundry detergent '' . objective information is tough to find ! i actually did conduct a hard target search for true , objective information on laundry detergents . there is very little beyond which brand causes pollution which , while important , is not what i was trying to find . `` consumer reports '' does have test comparisons of the most popular brands in its monthly magazine every couple of years and they do include some detail . about `` all 's website '' if you are looking for this product 's website it is under `` unilever '' and you will have to specify `` usa '' under products , as the word `` all '' will show up in almost every search result . you will find `` wisk '' and `` breyer 's ice cream '' and almost as many neat name brand products as you would at procter and gamble 's site .

0	the braun ls-5550 silk bodyshave rechargeable cord/cordless women 's shaver is absolutely useless , not fit for purpose
1	these wipes are great . i have three children and have used the pampers , huggies , and house-brand wipes . the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of them to get the job done . house-brand do n't smell as good and tend to be a bit rough . the pampers are thin , soft , and moist enough to get the job done-because they are thin , they can be maneuvered around in all the important places and folded / refolded for 100 % useage ( unlike the huggies that once they are folded they become too thick to maneuver ) . definitely not too dry as other reviewers have said . if you want something moister , go get a paper towel and wet it with water
0	the product is all smoke and mirrors . unless you have a clean room and are incredibly talented , you will not have lenses that are usable . in fact , several attempts to use the product resulted in lenses that were worse
1	i used this to get marks off my washer and dryer and then went on to clean the rest of the house ! this little `` sponge '' is awesome , and it is just like a sponge ; it 's not abrasive . the only problem i see with it ( and all cleaning products ) is that you actually have to use it for it to work ; lol
1	this is the best bargain for your money.pampers swaddlers are better than pampers . even better than costco brand . worth every penny
1	i have tried a gazillion of these `` diet '' protein bars . this is the only one i 've actually found so far that tastes good .
1	i luv this burberry . pple always comment anytime i wear it . my girlfriend almost made me stop wearing it cos she said anytime i wear it she feels like doing things i ca n't mention here 2 me , and since she feels tht way , other women will certainly feel like tht . i 'm getting another one ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! also fast and proper services by amazon
1	the roller balls are excellent ! the rolling action and three different speeds are excellent as well . the only drawback is the mesh over the pillow . it is abrasive to the skin . i have had to put a thin pillow case on top of it and that solved the problem . the only other problem is it has a hard area where your head lies so you must make sure you are situated properly . other than that , it is the best machine on the market i have found and i have tried many
1	we all have very pale skin in my family , and these are great little `` i forgot to put on sunscreen '' helpers ! i keep one in the car , one in my purse , etc. , so we are never without one . excellent product , and easy to use
1	i bought the remington mb-300 mustache and beard trimmer for my husband and was holding my breath as he is very picky . he has a gorgeous full beard and keeps it precisely trimmed . the remington has several adjustments for length , that pleases him the most , it trims whatever he aims it at , and does it well . it is light weight and maneuvers easily .

0	had to return this b/p cuff . could not get it to work properly . medical devices need to be made a great deal better than this one..
0	i agreed with all the criticism that the revlon eyelash curler ( now discontinued ) received . it broke quickly and used up batteries by the truckload . but the one thing it did well that the carmen curler does poorly is to provide the type of construction and shape that keeps you from accidently squeezing pieces of eyelid skin . this instrument catches my skin very easily and it 's hard to get good curled lashes without hurting my eyelids
1	great enginering , design and craftmanship ; works great every day ; but i had to throw away a travel size `` waterpick '' after 18 months , because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else . it does n't make any sense to supply an irreplaceable disposable part , on an equipment designed to outlast it three times
1	when i get a sinus infection , it stays and builds much congestion . rx and over-the-counter has limited value . one event that led to my first ( i am 69 ) severe asthma event , which messed up my immune system and led to my first angina events which the brought open heart surgury . neilmed pre-mixed packets sound like the `` minor leagues '' compared to the above . when a thorough cleansing is needed to make the sinus areas hostile to infection , these little packets take the mess out of measuring your own salt and soda ( i.e . to make a mistake is painful even with the right salt ) . then there is a $ 15 price in local stores for 100 packets , or about the same on-line for 200 . also a quick response from the vendor .
0	my girls bought this for their step dad for his birthday . he wo n't even listen to it any more because he has to reset the station every time he turns it on . we can never find the station we like without having another radio on to find it . the main reason he quit listening is because after i spent time trying to set the station in the morning , during his shower the station would automatically change to another one , give me a break ! this is a worthless radio , it does n't even deserve 1 star
0	of little or no use - much to difficult to use when you are excercising - i find this product totally unacceptabl
0	the good : the massage function works fine , no problems with the performance , and the battery holds a good charge . the bad : how much money is saved in construction by using the cheapest foam padding imaginable ? the ugly : the 'pebbled vinyl ' material on the arms is already separating after six months . maybe a cheaper material could have been found ... but i doubt it . overall good in theory , but very poor in execution . if some real quality were put into the product , it would rate potentially 5 stars . 'til then , you 've been warned ... .
0	it did what it was supposed to do , and my bras came out of the wash without any weird creases . however , some bras hold up better in the washing machine than others , and i think the one i put into the brababy was one of the more durable ones . while it does what it 's supposed to , it definitely is not easy to use . i had difficulty putting a b-size cup in without squishing the bra . the clasp is also badly designed . if it breaks , it 's not a big deal to tie the outer ball closed , but the whole thing is poorly engineered . i think it was made even harder seeing as how i tried using the brababy with a front-closing racer back . in the end , i think it would have been easier and just as effective to use a lingerie bag . i do n't recommend this product
1	i have been looking for a overbed table so that i could use my laptop and watch tv in the bed room . and this is the one i have been looking for . it takes about 15 mins for me to put it all together . did not have any problem at all
1	the jerdon 7p7506cf ( or as i call it , the ol'6cf ) is a nice , reflective wall-attachable mirror . i ca n't say enough about how reflective this thing is ; i 'm a bit of an amateur facepainter ( although i have zero artistic ability- my spider-man faces usually end up looking like spotty tomatoes ) , so i need a good mirror whenever i self-paint . i have gone through three similar models before finding the 6cf , and none has been as clear and user-friendly . in short , if you 're looking for the best mirror value for your dollar , i ca n't recommend this thing enough . it 's the mirror of the 21st century , and beyond
1	i love this product ... it is so well worth the money if you 're experiencing a skin problem . easy to use , portable , no lotions or creams needed ... just my little leather case
1	i really like this sanitizer . the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i wish that it was bigger so i could fit bottles and things slightly larger in it . but , i do put her pacifiers and bottle nipples in there .
0	this product may be good for something but it is not good for plucking your own face . i was very disapointed in it . the tweezers were hard to push together . the light was too narrow to be helpful . the product was hard to position is a way that the magnifier could be used . i tried to use it several times and always got frustrated .
0	i had a good massaging heating pad that was great , and i used it on my legs a lot. , thought i could replace it . this one is not even in the ballpark . absolutely useless , i have been had
1	my wife had high bp , so we got this model . the reasons for choosing this model were that : 1. the upper arm monitors are supposed to be more accurate 2. it was cheaper than the fully automatic models 3 . omron seems to be one of the better/best brands . 4 . supposedly , the pumps on the fully automatic models are prone to breaking . the unit appears well built ( including the hand pump ) . it is easy to operate , and it seems very accurate . we checked its readings with an fully manual unit that we have at home , and the automatic unit at the drug store . we find it takes very accurate and consistent readings . people with physical limitations might find the hand pump inconvenient . also , people with a big arm might need to buy the larger cuff . i 'm overweight right now , so the cuff barely fits my arm , but fits my wife 's nicely ( it was bought for her )
0	every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight . we returned it to amazon , probably the first time we 've ever had to do that . for the price it should at least work . also , in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner . it earns two stars for looking great . i would not recommend it .
0	it was so so , and didnt see any real results . but it was definently better than tend skin or mi
0	i bought the goggles and was excited by the look . they are kind of `` riddick '' like . they had disappoiinting performance when i rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face . they did float and so i found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened . i gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing . they definately are not for extreme sports . they are also too big for casual use as sun glasses .
0	this one is too small for a bedroom , just like a toy . i returned this one and reordered sunbeam 701-000 ultrasonic humidifier , which is much bigger . generally speaking , the ultrasonic humidifier is much quieter than the regular ones
0	i have not tried the product yet as it is a stocking stuffer for my four year old . the ad displays four soaps when in fact you only receive one . i would not have purchased one bar of soap had i have known .
0	this product was not as i expected . it is much weaker than ones used in the past . it certainly was not worth the price i paid . i returned this item .
0	the shave gel bars that are attached to this razor extend out past the razor making a close shave nearly impossible . this razor worked ok on my legs where an extreme smoothe surface is not necesssary . but using this on the the more intimate areas is just frustrating because the gel bars did not allow the razor to get close enough to the skin . this razor does not poduce a light lather , it is more like a slime that drips from it . i did not notice a tropical scent
0	i know that i am at an fpo address so that makes it more difficult to send and receive parcels but , to have never gotten the parcel is unsatisfactory . i never got the item that you wish me to make a review on . send it to me and i will gladly use it and then review it
1	i 've had other razors and believe me , this one is the most reliable on i 've had ! it works well , does not hurt ? ( maybe the people who had one that pinches or hurts them got a bad one ? ) a feature i like and use often is the head pops up to cut longer hair ... unfortunately at times i need this before i use the regular cutter . battery life is acceptable , power is good , and just a few swipes is all you need . you really ca n't compare a blade razor to an electric- they are not yet comparable for cutting or time used . this razor , however , has a better level of shaving than other electrics , closer to a blade than the others . in convenience an electric is much better than any blade- you can use it anywhere , dry , just sittin ' around
0	i agree with the other reviews . it was a huge disappointment that it did n't heat the water . it is only supposed to maintain the temperature , but after using it for about 20 minutes , it did n't even do that . the manual rollers hurt my feet and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet back and forth . back to the store indeed
1	i never thought that i could get my hair straight enough to actually like it . until i found this vs sassoon straightener . it is the best ! ! i use it all the time and i love the way that it makes my hair look shiny and feel feather soft . i would tell anyone with wavy or curly hair who wants super straight , soft hair , to use this product . you ca n't go wrong !
0	i tried with two sets of new batteries , the goggle unit flashed but no massaging action whatsoever happened . besides that , the design looks cheap and it feels very tight and uncomfortable to wear . avoid this item
0	if you think you are buying the old met-rx bars by the same flavors , you are in for a very very bad surprise . the old bars had better taste and a almost cake-like consistency . these were so sticky that i could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one . also , i could n't get past the taste . even the color is different . i never finished the bar and i used to eat one a day ( years ago ) . i gave the entire box away for free . i will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe .
1	these seem to be an excellent product . there is little or not leakage . the wipes were a nice treat
1	the best sports bar around . great taste , organic , contains plenty of antioxidants , and contains a good amount of protein . the only down side is the high amount of carbs , especially the sugars , but i still give it five stars
1	my wife loves this ! it was not too expensive , and she really has been very appreciative , esp for her eye makeup
1	for years i have had many a vacation ruined because i break out in hives with very little exposure to the sun . after my dermatologist recommended this product i tried it . two vacations later . . . not a single hive or sunburn . well worth the price . actually goes pretty far also
0	i did n't realize there was hfcs ( high fructose corn syrup ) in these bars . if you work out or are health conscience , then i would suggest doing a little online research about harmful effects of hfcs . i 'm about to switch up my protein bars .
0	does n't thiss say it all ? `` screw-on threads failed my shake spilled . '' i threw it away and use my martini shaker instead
1	clean and crisp . defined and smooth . i use burberry by burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening . it has woodsy notes that remind me of autumn . i am very picky about my fragrances and i only use two regularly -- eau d'issey by issey miyake is my main scent , but i do use burberry sometimes on occassion and i love it . thats it
1	i got this product when the price dropped down to $ 12 . so for that price i liked this product a lot . it heats the lotion well . initially i thought it was small , but now i think it is the correct size . i did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this . i switch it on when i go for a bath and by the time i am back , the lotion is ready and warm . it is a great buy , and for all you bargain shoppers , wait till the price drops . it is especially a great buy during winter
1	optimum nutrition 's 100 % whey protein is hands down the best i have tried , and i have tried a lot of different shake products in the past 10 years . i used to be committed to eas and labrada , but i found that the shakes are too hard for me to digest compared to on whey protein . i mix it with water , and sometimes soy milk . it mixes easy , does n't taste gritty , and is pure protein . it goes down very easy and i have no trouble digesting it , plus it builds muscle when combined with a solid workout plan . plus , the price is reasonable .
0	i ordered this item for my husband and i was extremely disappointed . it is poorly made and basically is not worth the money . i do not recommend it at all
0	it was alright , but in a warm jacuzzi tub , it did n't last very long
0	the massager is top heavy and very heavy and will not stay on your hand . you will go nuts trying to keep the straps/massager secure on your hand
1	the toothbrush is great , feels like you just came from the dentist and had your teeth cleaned
1	this parfum is the most superlative of fragrance that hit the liquid stands today and for decades to come . it has such an amazing aroma it almost makes you want to eat it ! it is by far , in my zestfull opinion the odoriferous maximus of profumo ! i give this bold majesty of the monarchy , the ( il duce ) ! five stars `` ***** ''
1	omgosh i can not tell you how much i love this straightener . it makes my hair so soft its like baby bottom soft or when u sand wood for a really really long time . i love it . i use it everymorning.. at night i use the wet setting to dry off my hair and then in the mroning i finish it off with the dry settting . but i also use sunsilk pink bottle 24/7 creme . its an absolute must-have . to the person who gave it one star.. maybe yours was a defect . im sure everyone else who has rated it so far loved it . did you straighten it section by section ? it doesnt work if you do it all at once . i recommend this straightener ! its not that expensive and also makes a great christmas gift . looks nice too . enjoy
0	the idea is fantastic . the fact is i do n't wake up immediately like bzzzz -- i 'm awake . amazingly i can hit the snooze on a regular alarm without ever knowing it . on this alarm , the light starts glowing and gets brighter and brighter over a period of time you select . i have mine set for 15 minutes , and usually by the time the light has reached maximum i 'm coherent enough to get up . if the light does n't do it , you can add sounds ranging from a buzzer to screeching sea gulls -- ocean , wind , and ringing bells falling somewhere in between . the flaws : as others have mentioned , the light itself makes a buzzing noise at low light levels . so when it first pops on in the morning , you also get the annoying filiment vibration of the lamp . secondly , you do n't set the alarm for when you want to get up . you have to go through some math calculations , figuring out when you want to wake up and how long it will take you to get to that point . then you set the alarm for that earlier time ( awake minus groggy equals alarm time ) . third , if you use the sound in addition to the light , it does increase in volume as the light increases in intensity , but the sound starts out so loud to begin with that the light is really pointless . a workaround we 've found for this is to use the external speaker provided . plug it into the back of the light , run it across the room , and bury it upside down under some pillows . then pick a sound like `` birds '' instead of the lip-curling `` harbor '' or `` town '' . from it 's buried location across the room , the sound hits the right volume about the time the light maxes out . whoever came up with the plan of making the sound come on with the light was just not thinking . fourth , the clock lumination can change colors , rotating through the entire rainbow all night long in its default setting . at first that looks cool . until you realize a bright yellow clock glowing in your face at 2 a.m. is just wrong . the darkest setting is red , and the only way to choose it is to hit a pause button on the back when it rotates around to that color . so yes , it works . and it wakes me up without making me use my hammer . but the design is just plain stupid . if the manufacturer would wander by here , read this and make a few design changes , they could make a light worth buying
1	this product does a surprising job for its low price . it gives my hair so much body and softness , and is extremely easy to use . gets plenty hot enough
1	i bought this for my boyfriend . i needed something affordable , and this was it . the bubble machine is quiet , and the warmth of the water lasts for a pretty long time . the only complaint i have are the warnings it has . it just gets me uneasy and that something drastic might happen if i make a mistake . well other than that , this product is good . i 've had it for i think a couple of months now , and nothing awful has happened and it 's still working fine . :
0	but leaves a lot to be desired in practice . just get a small electric or hand crank food processor . this is not worth your time
1	i use this product all the time . it was becoming hard to find in department stores , but i found it available and cheaper online . i 'm very happy .
0	i have been using an electric shaver for 30 years.i have gone through 3 different syles of shavers this past year since my old remington died . none of them work well . what gives remington ? ? ?
0	i complete disagree with the previous review on that sonicare is superior . i 've used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and braun sonic complete is by far the best . however , this unit is nothing like sonic complete , the sonic energy is completely in the handle , it 's like holder a vibrator . the real sonic complete channels the energy to the brush head ... you are probably better more with one of the other two models of vitality that uses rotational brush heads
1	the sound of it working is great ambient noise for sleeping and wth oils it makes you room smell wonderful ! it does a reasonable job of humidification in my medium sized bedroom but it acts a little snarky in that it tries to turn itself on often when there is no water left in it . and it doesnt hold enough water to enjoy it all night but it will run for several hours . the light show and the aromatherapy can be quite a nice mood setter romantically as well
1	i was very happy with the prpduct and the shipping was very quick , even in the middle of the holidays . i will probably order another 3 inch memory foam from allsleep for my queen size bed
0	i bought two of these based on a 2005 customer review saying they do n't have automatic shutoff , but now they do . i guess this is considered an improvement , but i bought them for an elderly cat , and she ca n't reset the control every hour . they are a good value if you do n't mind the auto shutoff
0	having owned several panasonic wet/dry shavers over a 20 year period i can , with authority , say that this model is a big disappointment . the battery life is outstanding , but that 's because the motor speed is so slow it 's not using much juice . and with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor . the next time i wo n't pinch pennies ; the higher priced models from panasonic are worth the price difference
1	this is excellent..i like the ease of using it and the digital read out is great . i highly recommend this produc
0	same as the other review . the thermometer will not turn on . i wo n't change the battery because i do n't think i should have to pay for it if i bought a brand new product . i will return it and buy a better thermometer
1	it usually takes forever for me to dry my hair , but it dried really fast and straight ! i can go a few extra weeks without a relaxer ! and the color is beautiful ... i just love orange : o
1	bought this razor and happy with it so far . it shaves close and is not as loud as i expected . glad i bought this one
0	i have owned the caruso molecular steam hairsetter for at least the last 15 years and would not buy any other hairsetting product . it is gentle on the hair and gives a wonderful , soft , steamed curl , as opposed to harsh , electric hot curlers . i recently purchased the new `` smaller version '' , because my old one - with the larger water/heating unit , burned out after many years of use . the old one required more water and a bit of salt . it gave great steam , filling the rollers with a lot of steam , thus giving a better curl to the hair . this newer version does not require salt , uses very little water , and does not have the steam making power the older version did . i am very dissappointed in this `` newly designed '' product . i have packed it away , and will use it only as a back up . i hate it when you use a product for many years and find they have upgraded , improved , or discontinued the product . sometimes , it is best to leave well enough alone . i will purchasing one of the older hairsetters on ebay
0	we recently bought the same model dispenser , but in the satin finish . from the first , only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps did n't work ( yes , we followed the instructions carefully ) . two months later , another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable . instead of this loser , try `` the dispenser 71450 classic iv . '' we had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age . it 's harder to fill than the aviva and not as pretty , but so what -- it works , and the aviva does n't .
1	these are the best nursing pads out there . i tried several others that would not stick and would leak . i 've never had any problems with these
1	recieved product on time , and i wil for sure order from this company agai
1	these are hands down , the most awesome pillows , we have ever owned . they were originally suggested by a chiropractor at $ 60 per pillow , however at the time , a `` water bed pillow '' for $ 60 just sounded silly . what brought me back around to these pillows , was the year-long search that my wife and i had been on for the perfect pillows . one of her beloved cats managed to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows , which subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search for the perfect pillow . we spent a year , buying this pillow and that pillow , all to no avail . then one day i rolled the dice , and bought a pair of these pillows with the covers . the covers actually make the dish . these are the most comfortable pillows that i have ever slept on in my 42 years on this planet ! ! ! these pillows rate 10 stars ! ! ! just follow the directions and enjoy the best nights sleep you have ever had . i do not work for , nor own this company , although after using their product i wish i did ! ! ! our pillows are about three months old so far , and holding up exceptionally well . they recommend you change the water every six months or so , depending on what type of water you put in . the pillow is about half to three quarters cushion , with the water being the bottom layer . they seal tight and do not leak . there is no audible sound from the water in the pillow , as if you follow the directions , they will instruct you on how to expel excess air . these pillows and of those black decker scissors , have to be my two best finds for 2006 ! !
0	at christmas 2003 i was very excited with the $ 50 scale my family purchased for me . it worked as advertised for about six months . then it displayed the err message more and more . we replaced the battery . then it would not permit any function buttons to perform . we just sighed and used my expensive gift as any $ 7 bathroom scale . when it went completely blank this week , battery of no use , i hopped on the internet to see what anyone else 's experience is . to be fair , i will contact the manufacturer and see if they can make it right . i hope they can . if not , i will see what the weight watchers scales is like . sigh ...
1	this hair dryer is truly a professional , salon type dryer . many dryers are advertised as such , but this one lives up to that reputation . very sleek , beautiful coloring and easy to handle with turbo feature . this was a surprise ( turbo ) which i 'm enjoying , coupled with the smooth and strong drying . the sound is even pleasant , not too loud , and it works quickly . ( especially since i have very thick hair ) i would recommend this dryer as an excellent buy for the inexpensive price . aj in n
1	i 've been using remington 's shaver saver for 20 years . it keeps your shaver clean , lubricates well with not too much gooey oil , and works in an instant . i use a remington ms2-100 microscreen 2 , and after a shaver saver treatment the shaver glides smoother over my face and shaves quicker and closer . a treatment seems to last for a while and i do n't think it 's necessary to use it every day . usually 2 to 3 times a week seems to be sufficient and your shaver will continue to perfrom like new
0	the `` original '' glide was made by ( or used ) gore tex material . the photo for this product showed the logo for gore tex . the product shipped was the product now marketed by crest ; no mention of gore tex . the crest product is vastly inferior to the `` original '' gore tex
0	i like how quickly the rollers heat - a vast improvement over waiting at least half an hour . however , like the other reviewer said - i absolutely hate the clips . they are all one size , so they are too large for the smallest rollers . i also do n't like them because they do n't keep the roller still like the `` u '' shaped clips did , and they leave a dent impression in my hair . i do n't recommend them primarily because of the clip system
1	i 'm not sure how well since i have never used anything like this before , but my bath water feel a whole lot better and i do not itch for an hour afterwards . i probably should have rated a 5 star , but i really have no base for comparing . i will definitely buy this product again .
0	horrible just like tend skin . try princereigns or min they actually work and dont burn your face off like tend skin or magic shav
0	what a waste of money . not only was it just average in size but it was made of incredibly flimsy , really cheap plastic .
1	this scale was easy to understand and measures the same as my doctors office . easy to monitor weight and fat
1	delivers moist heat . great large size . you wo n't find anything larger anywhere.very relaxing as lavender is calming . only problem is it only stay warm enough for 10 min and heat really should be applied for 20 minutes . i have placed a heating pad underneath in it the last 10 min . and lied down with head neck in comfortable position and it did a great job . pricey but worth it
1	i love this . everyone can have their own data and we can track our own progress . it is very simple to use and the explanations are clear
1	great tooth brush.my dentist said my gums and teeth have never looked bette
1	this unit has the power transformer at the wall socket end instead of in the handheld part . the handheld part is mostly made of plastic . so , it 's pleasantly light to hold , much lighter than my wahl homecare thing . the supplied guard things ( that you swap to change length , etc . ; iirc they range from 1/8 '' to 1 '' ) have a curve on the bottom so it 's easier to have them glide over concave surfaces instead of digging the pointed end into them . this also makes things more pleasant . do n't believe the no-mess story , though . it really does catch most of the hair , so it 's certainly worthwhile , and it 's easy to empty the hair trap , but i still have to vacuum the remainder afterwards . it does n't catch it all
1	i bought this after using the inexpensive wahls for years . i love it for several reasons : 1 ) it cuts without pulling on your whiskers 2 ) it is very precise 3 ) it picks up 90 % or more of your whiskers 4 ) not only do you not have the hair in the sink , but you no longer feel like it will take a shower to get all of the excess hair out of your beard , if there is any to speak of 5 ) unlike others , i did not feel the need to have a more precision tool to trim my mustache . it worked just fin
0	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use . they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on . the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me . every head is different , so maybe they 'll work better for you
1	i am very pleased with the light output . i purchased them to light the inside of my childs playhouse . they really iluminate the inside as bright as a standard light bulb . i purchased a couple of years ago an earlier type lanturn by rayovac and was really pleased with it also .
0	worked well five times . then it slowed down and made cutting more difficult despite removing head and running water through it to clean , as per instructions . then it would run before cutting , but upon trying to edge trim my moustache , it would stop immediately , as if a single hair could jam it . removing head , as required for cleaning , showed that bottom part with its drive motor worked fine , with a rotating metal stub that fit loosely into a poorly made plastic part that moved the blade . it appears that this plastic part 's stability , shape and alignment changed after a few uses allowing hairs to jam its movement . a poor design that should n't have used plastic . do not bu
0	i had another norelco shaver for the last 5 ( or more ) years . the difference in the shaves is striking . both less pain when my stubble is a little long and closer . however , the reason this shaver is cheaper is that there is 1 battery inside it instead of 2 . i know this because i took it in to be `` repaired '' because i only got 8 shaves to a charge . i talked ( online ) with norelco and they said my shaver was broken . so , i looked up on the norelco site a local authorized repair shop . i took it in and the guy opened it up . he said it was one of the `` cheap '' versions that has 1 instead of 2 batteries . my old shaver , over most of its life , gave me 25 or so shaves before needing to be recharged . that 's quite a difference
0	i like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper , so i bought tushies . when my baby was newborn , they seemed to work ok , maybe because she did n't put out that much . she is now three months old . i practice attachment parenting so i know exactly when she has a bowel movement . the past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly . she was sitting on my lap , she had a bowel movement , five seconds later i got up to change her , the feces was all over my pants . this has happened several times . the concept of the diaper is great , but the diaper needs some work around the legs
1	very nice trimmer . my hat off to remington . i have been using this trimmer on both my hair and beard . it words perfectly and is much better than changing spacers
0	this was a terrible product . i got little sores everywhere i used it . believe me , i will only use it once . wish i had my money back
0	this item is more of a foot and ankle massager if you have long legs . i am tall with a 37 '' inseam . this item is not made for someone who has longer than `` average '' legs unless you 're looking for a foot and ankle massage rather than a calf massage .
0	as others experienced , both packs each had two dead batteries in them . i am even using the juice family charger , so it is n't a brand problem . the packaging was a little beat up as well as if they were sitting around for a long time . sort of dirty . also purchased d batteries as well and that packaging was worse . hard to knock the fact they are made in china because let 's admit it , pretty much everything you buy is made in china . the problem is the poor quality control from the company juice battery themselves . these are actually ok batteries if they work , but not worth the price especially when taking the chance on whether they will arrive beat up or doa . even though still most likely made in china , stick to the main well-known brands insread of this junk
1	i gave this to a bearded man for christmas . to my knowledge , he has used it only once , with no complaints . was nice for the main reason , he had no electrical outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another room to use old one . this one is so convenient and i am sure he enjoys it . purchasing was a breeze . thank yo
0	this mister is not for continuous use . had it for only 2 days and the bubbler weakened and barely gave out a mist . but good as a lighting decor and ambience .
1	i had never used an auto cuff before , so i had my doubts , but after using this over a period of weeks it seems to be right on the money every time . i would buy it agai
1	you know right away your teeth feel different , much like how they feel after a dentist cleaning . the dual action ( larger ) head is gentler and feels more like a normal toothbrush but it certainly is n't as aggressive as the smaller one in it 's ability to clean . if you can handle the smaller heads they certainly do a better job . the flossing attachment was also very effective
1	tastes better than most candy bars and has no refined sugar or artificial ingredients
1	while a little dubious , i am know a believer -- really helps me get motivated and stay energized focused for my workouts . start with a single scoop and adjust as needed
0	it does n't really smell like anything , and the heat creates dampness on what ever you put it on . but it is a good size and shape
0	this stuff smells bad , like a mix of medicine and pesticide . had to throw it out
0	i bought 8 size d 's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips . wrong answer . i was able to play 2 1/2 cds before my box was out of juice . game over . i realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around , but these batteries were fresh off the charger when i left . i figured they 'd at least last into the night , but they were finished before sundown . do n't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices ... i got fooled . fool me once , shame on you . we ca n't get fooled again
1	i love this product and the lasting results . it is so gentle on my hair . i bought two , one being a christmas present for my neighbor who had recently had a very bad perm , and she agreed , makes the set last while not futher damaging your hair . if you are sleeping in curlers , sleep no more . this product is for you
1	the refills were easy to order fit my brush perfectly . it 's a lot easier ordering on line received in home rather than trying to find the merchandise in a store
0	in the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them . i wish i had known this before . now i have to waste about $ 20 in shipping to return it . do not buy for body fat measurement
0	this may work well , but the cuff size is not as it is in the description . it says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches . not even close . my arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far . sure , you can get the cuff to go around your arm , but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly , and there was just no way to even come close
1	it 's small , folds down and is great to pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer . i just wish you could set it on cool and blow as fast cuz it does get pretty hot . very convenient item if you travel
0	do you want the real secret on how to grow your hair ? first , you need to have a healthy diet that includes plenty of vegetables and protein . protein ! then you have to keep your hair and scalp clean , trim your ends , and not use heating appliances all the time ! lastly , drink water ! that 's the secret ! you go on a hair care board and you 'll find people who swear by vivisical . they 'll show you before and after pictures and in the after picture it 's just the person with their head tilted all the back just to make it look like their hair grew 5 inches in 2 months ! do n't believe that nonsense ! if you buy viviscal , you 're a sucker ! you 're better off just taking a multi-vitamin
1	i bought this for my boyfriend and he uses it for his facial hair and to shave his head . its very easy to clean and does a great job
0	the plastic on the foot massager was cracked down the center with a thin crack branching off to the right spinner . i was not in the same state when the package arrived so i was not able to open it for over a month ... my loss . i do n't know if it was not structurally sound , or if the box was just not handled properly . either way , i 've got a dud
0	bought two of these . one as a gift and one for myself . luckily i tried mine out before i gave the other away . this thing just vibrates . no massage at all ! ! after 30 seconds you get nausea ... its not worth 23.99 ... its a piece of junk . trust me you are not getting a bargain . i guess you pay for what you get , but in this case i ca n't even say that because in no way will this help someone with a bad back or someone who needs a rub .
1	i wanted a cordless shaver because at my age ( 49 ) i need my glasses on to see the hairs i 'm shaving , and that does n't work well in the shower ! this braun is a good buy , easy to use , and works well if you follow the directions and shave slowly . it 's not as close or smooth as a blade and shaving gel , but it 's quicker and less mess , so i think it 's a good trade-off .
1	i 've had my first bottle of this after shave for a year and i have just finally begun to run out . while i do n't use it everday , i use it regularly and when needed . i use an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly irritated . this nivea after shave is wonderful . it only takes a small amount to cover my whole face and neck . it leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling . sometimes i 'll leave the house and forget to put it on , and i 'll go all the way back just to put it on . it gets your day off to a great start . no funky smells or textures here . give it a try , you wo n't be disappointed
1	i purchased the revlon facial steamer , this was my first purchase on line and i am very satisfied with the steamer and the service i received from amazon . the steamer is great i use it when i give myself a facial , i have not use the nail kit yet .
1	the oral b eb417 dual head power brush replacement does a great job of getting into tight places , reaching back teeth , removing plaque , has a nice gum massage action , and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very refreshed . the two heads work twice as good as one , but may take some getting used to if your used to a single brush head . using it by gently guiding it over your teeth , and letting it do all the work , it will last a long time too . it was nearly three months before i had to replace mine . most oral b brushes are interchangeable with all oral b units . this one though , according to the buying info here , may not be used with the cross action brush . it will also indicate when it 's time for replacement by the fading colors of the bristles . ( the box shows as good picture of new and used ) . just a little of your favorite toothpaste goes a long way too ! it 's a 5 star product , but unless you are just one person who just wants to try it out , the better buy would be to purchase the three pack . it 's almost like getting one free . my pack also came with different color rings , that fit on the brush at the base and is nice for families to tell the brushes apart . it 's nice to have a spare for unexpected guests as well . keep smiling ... .laurie
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose . i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all ; as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in `` so i married an axe murderer '' . the idea/concept is great but ... i 'll probably return them . unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them . people with really big heads , caveat emptor
0	this product did not work . i was faithful for 1 month with no results
0	it felt nice when my head and neck were resting on the real-ease , but the device failed to relieve the tension in my upper back and neck ( past the time i spent lying on the device ) . i 'm about 6 ' tall .
1	easy to use.it seems quite accurate.the only bad thing is it needs batteries , which cost a lot
1	i have had other bath pillows that slid around or just were not comfortable , either itchy or not supportive at all . this pillow is just right , and nice and soft , and has n't gotten exceptionally dirty or moldy , which i was worried about
0	the concept is cute , although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them , but the main problem is that they give you hat hair , compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head . regular glasses go in between the hairs , so everything fluffs out . if you never take off your reading glasses , have a buzz cut , are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head ( but be careful of buns ) , the clic connect reader may be fine for you . otherwise , conventional glasses are a better bet
0	i placed the order on feb 28 , but did not receive the package even on april 12 . i called the customer service , and was told that the item has never been shippped , while i do not receive any information about that . moreover the customer service even do n't bother to say sorry
1	we only use seventh generation laundry products now . it is amazing how much better our clothes feel with these products . the baby detergent gets the babies very dirty clothes very clean in our front loader
0	this brush is worth about 10 bucks . anything more and you are throwing money down the drain .
0	you were kind enough to replace my first order of these razors due to the fact that one never worked and the other wore out quickly . the second pair seems to be pretty much the same . one sputs and spurts and the other works only when i shake and tap it several times . i used to own another brand of these razors that were great , but i ca n't recall the name , unfortunately . i am very disappointed in the product , but i 'm very satisfied with amazon and the way in which they are trying to please me every way they can
0	i had a wahl clipper pair before . it was a good pair of clippers . the pair i owned previously was white and black as pictured in your ad . that was the pair i wanted again . the pair i have now does not perform like the previous pair . so i 'm stuck with the pair ihav
0	the pressure on the rain setting is so low you have to keep it on the concentrated spray to really wash the soap out . switching between the two causes a cold stream to come out for a second or two till it clears . also it is not sturdy - when the showerhead is moved to a higher position it does not stay and falls back down to the lower position . i will be returning mine
0	this flat iron combo curler is not worth the money that i spent for it . first of all it does not get hot enough to straighten my hair . although i must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry . if anyones hair is the least bit thick it will not work . i wish i had spent more and got the sedu since it had very good reviews . now i have to start over and buy a new one because this iron can not be returned if it has been opened . now , tell me how anyone would know if it works or not if it is not opened and used . `` duh ''
0	i am now going through what everyone else is talking about . finding replacement bulbs . for $ 20 this is unfortunately for some a `` throw away '' mirror . at least ours lasted more than 4 weeks
0	these glasses arrived yesterday and are the cheapest , poorly made , and most awkward glasses i have ever tried on . they are uncomfortable and look and feel as if they were purchased in the 10 cent bin at the local dollar store . pure garbage . do n't waste your money . [ ... ] i ca n't imagine that any consumer would think of these in a positive manner .
1	i have been using this attachment to my waterpik for gum disease for five years -- -- it directs the medicine into the gum pockets easily and helps save me from really big bills at the periodontist . it works for me , but needs to be used in conjunction with regular flossing , brushing , and generally good tooth care .
0	i have placed the order on oct 9th for $ 114.95 , now on nov 10th amazon is asking me to approve my revised order again for $ 125.95 . i made a mistake when i should have ordered directly from folica i could have used it for a month now ! the 1 star rating has nothing to do with the product quality , since i have not used it .
1	nowhere else in this country can you get this quality , accuracy and convenience at this price . fda approved and ncep certified , and the entire cholesterol panel ... no other at-home test can make those claims . as for my results , they agreed perfectly with the lab test at my doctor 's office . why would anyone want to waste time at their doctor 's office when amazon.com makes this superb biosafe test available to any customer . i 'm recommending it to all my friends . buy one today ! or better yet 2 ; get one for a friend
0	ok i picked up a corded vidal sassoon hairclipper at target . the thing was so absolutely horrible that i had to come to amazon to vent about it . the blades seemed blunt , if not nonexistent . it would only cut little tufts of hair , and the hair had to be taut , literally held by my fingers . it literally tried to rip the hair out of my head . my follicles still hurt from the hour or so i spent trying to shave my head with this terrible clipper . most of the hair i actually successfully removed , was due to scissors . lubrication and blade adjustment with the screwdriver had no effect -- the blades were n't *stuck* , they just *suck . * i do n't care how much money vidal sassoon spends trying to portray themselves as the trendy cutting edge in fashion maintenance -- judging from this horrible experience , they really , really do not know how to make a decent hairclipper . i have shaved my head plenty of times over the last few decades , and i have seen some bad clippers , but never have i experienced a clipper that was so bad that it would probably be bested by a haircut given by a sharpened stone instead .
1	que maravilla comprar por amazon.com todo llego en perfecto estad
0	i bought this hoping this will be better than shaving and last longer , but its not good , first of all it does n't remove all the hair and second its very very painful and very very slow , if you have lots of free time to spend shaving the most painful way posible ( i have done wax and wax does n't hurt compare to this ) then this is your product . other bad thing it produces ingrown hair the horror !
1	i 've tried all kinds of bibs , but nothing works better than pampers bibsters . right size , great pocket to catch crumbs , covers my 18 mth old , soaks up spills . i use them full time , not just on the road .
1	i have 3 of the priva ultra waterproof sheet protectors and love the product ! it saves washing the whole bed . just put a draw sheet over the protector and it saves so much laundry . washes and dries extremely well
0	ordered this item on sept 28 . they were supposed to ship it within 1 week . after 1 week i received an email , they said they needed 2 more weeks . another email today ( nov 7 ) , they think they can deliver it by november 27 . that 's 2 months after i placed my order . at this point , i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year . fortunately with amazon , they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order , which is what i am going to do right now
1	i have a pretty complicating sleep schedule because of my graveyard shift at our local convenient store , with school and all it 's kind of hard keeping my sleep schedule straight . i 've tried many sleep aids and this one worked the best for me , no grogginess which is totally awesome for the days i have class early !
0	i got one of these to help me after i had major surgery . i have better than average hand and arm strength , but i found this particular model to be hard to operate ( i ca n't imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it ) . normal sized cans ( like soup or beans ) slipped out of its pitiful grip . i wound up using it just to roll things to myself when i dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash . this is definitely a lightweight ... too light for much real use . i should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more
0	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele . the fusion is a classic example , from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel . do n't buy into the hype , the fusion is an expensive joke of a product .
1	shaves great wet or dry . i like it because it pivots real good . no cuts , it was worth every penny
0	i purchsed a package of these because the supermarket was out of my regular diapers and my baby is only two months and we 've been trying different diapers . i was instantly disgusted by the scent when i opened the package ; the diapers are scented and it does n't say so on the package . i would never have bought them if i 'd known that . the worked fine for leaks and those related worries , but every time i put one on her i was irritated . i want to smell my baby , pooh incidend or not , when i pick her up . i do n't want to smell the flowery perfume a corporation has added to their diapers . shes my child , she smells , its ok
1	not a bad product . irritates the skin a little , but does remove your hair . the only things i do n't like is that the buffers wear out quickly and your hair grows back with in 2 weeks . it does a nice job of exfoliating the skin and is great for hard to reach places . not a bad product ; however , i hope someone soon comes up with something that can take hair away permanently or for a longer period of time . i would recommend this product
0	i recently purchased this product and i found the motor power to belacking and the tweezer heads dont work as well as the emjoi ap99 aka optima gold . the price for these two items are the same so if u want the best for the same money , dont get this one , get the ap99 model instead
0	the topmost review described these batteries as `` aa in a d package , '' which is entirely correct . what certain loser battery brands like energizer do is put a aa battery in a d-sized sleeve , thereby hoodwinking unwary consumers into purchasing an inferior product that holds a much smaller ( approx 2500 mah ) charge than a `` normal '' d cell ( 9000+ mah . ) fortunately , these bogus d cells are easy to spot if the manufacturer prints the maximum charge on the packaging -- that is , 2000-2500 mah , which is aa cell territory . additionally , the fakes are much lighter than the genuine article -- inside is mostly air . too bad i mistakenly bought a package of these . i 'll have to settle for consoling myself by boycotting energizer for the rest of time . ( ...
1	excellent price and quick shipping . this was the best available for 3.4 oz size
1	i 'm more than satisfied with this scale . i was concerned that i would have to buy a more expensive scale to get good accuracy ( see reviews of other digital scales in this price range , ) but i 've tested it several times over several days , and my weight varies by 2 pounds or less over the course of the day . my first weigh-in of the day is pretty much the same as previous mornings , sadly . the neutral color ( grey ) and glass would blend in well with just about any decor , and the lcd screen is easy to read , with 1.5 inch high numbers . the only thing i do n't like about it is that it creaks quite a lot when i step on it , even though i 'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load . that problem is in my head more than in the scale : i do n't think it 's going to break , but it sounds like i 've got two people standing on it at once -- i 'm not that fat , am i ? an added feature is that when i 'm craving , i go into the bathroom and look at it , and know that it is n't going to fall for any of my excuses tomorrow morning . so the last piece of cake still sits in the fridge . the scale has intimidated me into not eating it . accurate , easy to read , easy on the eyes , and intimidating -- i think it 's a good deal
0	the oral-b is a good product but the refills certainly are n't worth what they charge for them . i do n't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price . they could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $ 2.50 each , their rip off price of $ 8.50 ea is beyond absurd . the other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months . that 's a real laugh . even brushing just once a day , you 're lucky if you get a month out of them . so not only do they rip you off with their refill cost , they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with
0	we started getting a `` lo '' message when using the thermometer . it said that we needed to change the probe tip and clean the lense . this worked for a little while . we changed the tip on each use . now nothing works . after spending near $ 50 on this i feel like a chump . i want to throw it out the window . i 'm heading to the drug store now to buy something else
0	does n't work on coarse hairs . does n't remove , only trims . okay for fine light hair -- of course , if you have fine , light hair , you do n't need to try to remove
1	i purchased this hair dryer for an unusual reason : my old 1875 watt conair was actually too much wattage for my bathroom ( the circuit kept tripping ) , so i was actually looking for a dryer with less wattage . however , i did n't want to sacrifice power , as i hoped not to have to devote any additional drying time to my shoulder-length hair . so far , i 've been pleased with this hair dryer . it does seem a bit louder than my previous model -- not obnoxiously so , just a higher , more concentrated fan noise . the dryer is extremely light and compact ; it 's actually smaller than my folding travel dryer . it is very basic , with a choice of high/low settings only ( there is no heat/cool option ) , but it seems to dry my hair just as efficiently as my old higher-wattage dryer . overall , this is a very good basic hair dryer which gives you a wide variety of use options for a great price
0	i bought this scale because i figured the price was right . well , as they say , you get what you pay for . first of all , it is flimsy in construction . i am under 200 lbs. , yet when i step on it , the cheap plastic bends down . you can just feel how thin and unsubstantial the plastic is . next , the first time i weighed myself , i found that i had lost 7 lbs . overnight ! if only this were true . i did n't believe it . i stepped off and got back on and i had gained back 5 of the lost pounds . off and on again -- and i was up another 4 . if you like to just kind of average your many readings , then this scale will work for you . otherwise , take a pass . btw , and i was using it on a flat hard surface .
1	this is a very good product . it helps prolong the life of the electric razor
0	i do n't know what those other people were talking about but this energy drink tastes like melted popsicles . it 's basically just gatorade with more sugar in it . if you want an energy drink instead of a sweetened sports drink you should look elsewhere
1	this stuff is awesome for hangovers . it was like my high school staple ! i mean , i went through like a box a week . at least give it a try
