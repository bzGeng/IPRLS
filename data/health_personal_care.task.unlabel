At the doctors office I had a blood pressure reading on 12/05/05 of 148/82 and on 1/05/06 of 167/80. I started using Resperate on July 2006 at least 3 times a week. I have gotten as low as 125/75 but in the morning it can go to 160/88. I jog 3 miles everyday and use statins and a blood pressure lowering drug. I am 67 years old. Martin 
I've been using the RESPeRATE for a little over three weeks now, and I am starting to see some positive results! My blood pressure before using the RESPeRATE was around 150's/100's- now after three weeks of two a day sessions(once in the morning and once in the evening), my pressure is around 130's/70's. To tell the truth, I was having trouble at first with it, and was getting very discouraged, however, like the moderators on the RESPeRATE forum have continued to say, breathing easy and naturally is the key to sucess, something that I was not doing the first few times that I used the RESPeRATE. Now, I am actually enjoying using it, it really makes me feel calm and tranquil after my daily sessions. A Big "thumbs-up" for the RESPeRATE!!! Thanks, J 
I purchased this device for a friend that had very high blood pressure that was out of control. At the time (4 months ago) he was taking 4 different pills twice a day and while the pills helped in lowering the blood pressure it was still way above what it needed to be and the readings weren't consistant. After a month of usage his numbers started coming down, today 4 months after begining of usage he is down to half a pill a day, even his doctor who initially was a sceptic has become a beleiver and is recommending this to his patients. This device definetly works, I've read some of the negative reviews here and don't get it, its either they didn't use the device correctly as instructed or they are talking about another device completly. I have become an evangilist for this product and have one thing to say - If you have high blood pressure - GET THIS DEVICE, you won't be sorry, its a real way to get rid of all the medication you have been taking and a way to get your blood pressure down to where it should be naturally. 
A very useful device for synchronizing your breathing and heart beat, so as to lower your blod pressure without drugs. Anything that has few or, as in this case, no side-effects, other than to encourge you to relax, is very welcome. Very relaxing at the same time, so it is particularly good for those who don't find the time to relax during the day. Just 15 mintues a few times a week and you will find you almost want to use it every day. Would be even better if it could record multiple users instead of just the one person so it could be used by a family or in a clinic setting 
Purchased this machine for my wife (born 1949) who has high blood pressure (150+/90+ untreated) and Type-II diabetes. Had high hopes as this was not a drug-related therapy. But was vastly disappointed by lack of positive results. Yes, she enjoyed using it. But her blood pressure was not improved. HERE IS MY ANALYSIS for your consideration. If your high plood pressure is caused by stress and the cares of life, RESPeRATE may work for you. But there is no mechanism by which it can address or cure arteriosclerosis. So, carefully analyze the cause of your high blood pressure before buying 
Simple to use, convenient and effective way to lower blood pressure has led to a reduction, by half dosage, of one of my prescriptions. Personnally tested myself by going off, resperate and returning to confirm lower pressure. Some people who have recently reviewed the product here, clearly have not used the device, or used it correctly 
My daughter Morgane, who is now 8 years old, has been suffering from delibitating migraines since infancy (yes, there is such a thing, unfortunately). The symptoms are very impressive, she usually drops to the floor and starts vomiting within a few minutes. She cannot move or open her eyes. It makes her very anxious and we noticed that she hyperventilates when she thinks she is going to "get dizzy". We tried to make her breathe slowly and calm down, to no avail. Morgane's doctor told us that breathing slowly and practicing biofeedback were the best non-drug practices against migraines, and we try to avoid giving Morgane medication as she is so young. So I thought of using RESPeRATE as my Dad has high-blood pressure and I knew it worked on the breathing pattern. Morgane immediately understood how to use the device, it was so easy and even fun for her. It relaxes her and gives her the strength to know she can do something about her migraines. Her breathing pattern has reduced considerably and so far, she has not had another migraine attack for about 6 months. She used to have them every two months. I have purchased another device for my best friend, a long time migraine sufferer. The way I see it, it is such a painful condition that anything that helps without harm is a blessing 
All this box does is make tones to slow down your breathing. I looked at it for a long time, I never found a clear explanation of what it actually is. So I tried it and it seems like it should cost about $11.99. Save your money 
I have just started potty training my grandson. He calls it Poppy...and that's okay if it helps him to go in the potty. The pants are great. I've always had to use traditional cloth and it is so nice to use throwaway traning pants. Thank you Pampers!!! 
I am very happy with this product. I put it on my boy for overnight and it does not leak at all 
Great diapers but they took forever to complete the order. By the time they arrived at my house my son was deciding between boxers or briefs 
I use this product on my son and my wife I just love it. we will no buy any othe product but this one. Unless we run out without placing the order..... but it's easy enough for him to pull it down then pull it back up when he's finished. very convenient 
This is the 3rd or 4th time I have bought this type of batteries and I am always satisfied with their performance. They are a great value 
I have found Rayovac Alkaline Cells Last about 10% longer and have a slighty higher Starting Voltage than Most Akaline Cells 
It's amazing the functions that you can get from this handy equipment 
I think this product is very good. Once you've glanced at the user's manual it's easy to use. You can store several profiles in it so that every member of your family can quickly use it. The only thing I wish it would do that it doesn't is save previous results. This is a very handy tool for keeping track of your weight loss progress. You'll have an idea of how your body composition is chaning along with your weight 
I bougth some Omron's for my colleagues. I is a high quality product. The results may change, as a result of water changes in your body and your handling, so the results are not perfect but it works good as a general reference to know if you or your client is in its ideal weight, overweight, etc. I recomend this product to doctors, nutritionist and Herbalife Distributors ! 
For the payed money it's ok. It's easy to use. One thing that could make this gadget better is an interface with a computer, in order to record each reading and analize the progress time by time 
This is a well-made device of useful, though limited, value. It's usefulness derives from its consistency, which is amazing. Given that your body composition varies throughout the day, particularly your level of hydration, the Omron measurements vary by only fractions of a percent - exactly what you would expect. It measures small electric currents running from one electrode, through your body, to the second electrode. The Omron is programmed to estimate your body fat by measuring the impedance of your body to the flow of electricity. So, one might think that such a measurement would be straightforward, like on a weight scale. Electricity encounters fat, muscle, bone, and fluids and the Omron interprets the current and displays your body fat percent. Right? After all, when you step on a scale, the scale responds by showing your weight. You don't need to tell the scale whether you think you are an athlete or how old you are. It simply measures your weight. Well, the Omron doesn't work that way, nor do other similar devices, nor do skin-fold calipers. It looks to me as though electrical and skin-fold devices all simply measure surface body fat. Then they require that you input other data, such as your activity level ("normal" or "athlete" in the Omron case) and age. This is not good because it introduces general population averages into what should be specific measurements of YOU. For instance, regardless of your body, it is assumed that the older you are, the more internal fat you have. The resulting body fat estimates are dramatically different when factoring in those variables. The Omron (and calipers) is still useful, though, if you consider it to be a compass rather than a scale. You can't be sure that it can tell you where you are, but, over time, it can tell you where you are going. 
I love this product. It appears to be accurate to any other body fat analysis I have had, and it is quick and easy to use! Really has been helping me see my progress beyond the scale! I would recommend it 
I find the Omron hbf-306 body fat analyzer fairly simple to use and pretty accurate overall.... 
This body fat analyzer is user friendly and comes with a comprehensive guide on interpreting your body fat and BMI readings. The guide also discusses nutrition and exercise. I have been very happy with my purchase 
We purchased 2 of them and are very pleased with the size of them and really like the 2 option clips. Very easy to set up and use. Really like the memory feature of being able to see the last 7 days. Would recommend for anyone wanting to know how much they walk in a day and/or to use during your walking workout 
I have used this for about a week and have found it to be very accurate. I like the various readouts that it has and the quality appears to be excellent. It is very easy to set up and use. So far, I have found no fault with it 
This pedometer is about as accurate as you could reasonably expect. The features are suitable and it even looks good. The only problem I have with this product is minor, and it's why I gave the item 4 stars, rather than 5. The plastic holder/belt clip that comes with the pedometer is cheaply made and has a very puny little spring. If you don't plan on using the belt clip, this is definitely a 5 star item. Otherwise, just treat the holder gently and hopefully it will last longer than mine did, because Omron won't sell the holder seperately. The holder is the only weakness to speak of and if Omron redesigns it, this will be 5 stars across the board (For the record,I wouldn't let my opinion of the holder stop me from buying another one. I'd make the same suggestion to anyone who's on the fence - buy it. 
This pedometer works excellent! After only having it for a few months, it acidentally got put in the washer and to my amazement, after letting it dry out, it worked just as good as before! I highly recommend this product 
It does exactly what it is meant to (rare in these days of overcomplication) and is easy to set up. It even comes with a screwdriver needed to change the batteries (also supplied) 
This is an excellent pedometer, also I noticed that Oprah featured it on one of her weight loss shows. This pedometer keeps track of distance, calories, aerobic steps (walking continuously for 10 minutes), and regular steps. I like it most because it has belt clip and a clasp clip; I lost my last pedometer because it didn't have a clasp clip. This is an excellent buy 
Seems to be very accurate and easy to use, no complaints at all! 
The Body Journal allows you to store important health information for the whole family. I found it particularly useful for tracking my children's weight, height, vaccination records, and general health. While some of this information was recorded in baby books, much after their first birthday was only written on small pieces of paper that were inevitably lost. Using the journal for recording the information was easy and gave me peace of mind that I hadn't lost any information. I can see how The Body Journal would be particularly critical when trying to monitor a specific medical condition. It is reassuring to know that in the event of an emergency, the health records of my entire family and all their doctor's information are available instantly 
As the mother of two children, one with special needs this product is a must have. It allows me to easily keep track of all medical events. It is particularly useful when visiting a doctor for the first time as I can easily provide a summary of my child's medical history. No more guessing! When my children are grown they will have a record of their medical history. This is particulary useful for a child with a complex medical history. It's a very user friendly tool. I highly recommend this product. 
I like it very much. I most use the aerobic and regular steps information only, but it is all that I need to help me tracking my performance thru the year. After 18 months of usage, all I needed to do was change the battery (after 12 months). I do recommend it 
I bought this a week ago and thought it was great. I was pretty proud to see how much movement I actually got in a day 16000 steps ... UNTIL ... I bothered to check to see if it was counting my steps accurately... I can not get it to take an accurate number. I adjust it and it either counts way too many ....100% error sometimes or stops counting and doesnt count at all... I am looking for another brand now.. 
It is GREAT to be able to QUANTIFY your "steps for the day" and check out other benefits. I like the way it is small and unobtrusive on the waistband. I like the week's worth of data. I like the way it clears itself at midnight and starts the new day. I found it hard/time-consuming to set the original parameters. Once it fell (into water) and I had to re-enter the data. Bummer. My walking friends now are interested in getting pedometers of their own. It is fun to have new ways of motivating yourself and others. 
Since i got this product, i never have to worry about logging in my steps. The memory works great, i only have to log in once for a week long exercise and i don't have to worry about resetting it everyday becasue it resets on its own in a 24H basis. A great resource a great friend!go get yourself one 
I have used this unit for about a month without any problems. It is a very good basic unit that will count steps, distance traveled, calories burned, and also counts what they call aerobic steps. If you walk for 10 minutes or more consecutively those are considered aerobic steps. It also has a memory of total steps for the last 7 days. The only problem I have had is forgetting to take it off. I ran it through the washing machine the other day and it is still working, so it is apparently pretty tough. All in all I would say if you need a basic pedometer you will be happy with this one. 
Easy to use; and a wicked incentive to lose weight. Have lost 20 kilos in just a few months from walking. 
I first tried the Hooah Bar about six years ago. They were purchased from Ebay and had been stolen from the army. After going through the ones I had, and unable to find them again, because of the second Gulf War. They were all shipped overseas! I use them for surfing, and they are better than any of the other power/energy bars, for sustained energy. But, what also places them well ahead of the rest is the fact that you can throw them in a vehicle during the hot summer, 100 degrees and leave them for a week. Open it and eat it. Try that with a PowerBar, and you have chocolate milk! 
I have tried nearly all brands of energy bars. Hooah! are the best tasting and they give me the most energ 
Easy to open package,tastes good,stays fresh after opening and not using all at once, does what it's advertised to do 
These bars deliver on both the taste and energy. They chew better at warmer temperatures rather than colder temperatures 
These energy bars are different from any we have tired. We love the chocolate and the peannut butter. They really are great. Last weekend's golf tournament never would have been so easy in the Texas heat without a couple of these to give us the strength 
Bar tasts good and delivers an energy boost that lasts. Much much better than eating candy bars. Excellent buy and better for you than candy bars. I will continue to buy this product. 
I love these because they're delicious and just the thing for getting me through a long workout. They're also perfect for traveling...easy to pack, and sustain you during an all day hike or touristy walkabout. A friend of mine in Iraq says he eats them twice a day, for the taste, and also because--and I agree--he trusts an energy product designed by the military for soldiers much more than an energy product designed by a private company for profit 
Accurate and simple to use. I received my results in the mail in less than a week and the results matched my doctor's results! Highly recommend this test 
Very convenient for at home testing for those who wish to track their results on a more frequent schedule than their doctor's visits. Instructions are easy to follow and results are sent in a timely manner. The company also can build a profile so buyers can see their results over an extended time period 
Nowhere else in this country can you get this quality, accuracy and convenience at this price. FDA Approved and NCEP Certified, and the entire cholesterol panel... no other at-home test can make those claims. As for my results, they agreed perfectly with the lab test at my doctor's office. Why would anyone want to waste time at their doctor's office when Amazon.com makes this superb BIOSAFE test available to any customer. I'm recommending it to all my friends. Buy one today! Or better yet 2; get one for a friend 
A little difficult to calibrate correctly. The instructions are clear, but the machine doesn't seem to agree with my measurements, and so sometimes I get strange readings (30 paces, when I've walked 10 steps), etc... and no instructions given about how to troubleshoot this. I got it through experimentation, but I still get strange results... Maybe my pace is a LOT smaller than most people, but most of my readings say there should be about 2000 steps in a mile... my miles run about 3300... =/ Huh? Overall though, as a general guideline, it is sufficient 
IT WASN'T THE EXACT ONE I THOUGHT I ORDERED, WHEN I USE IT, IF IT'S AS GOOD OK 
I bought this pedometer for my Walking Club and they love it! They can count steps, miles and calories! It's easy to use and even setup specifically for ones weight and stride length 
This is good meter. We had to replace it after its sensitity switch went bonkers. We bought the same model. It worked every day for four years. I think it served us well 
Pros: it's really cheap, and has a lot of features (set stride length, calories, clock, backlight, protective door) Con: the door is really, incredibly, intolerably hard to open. I was adding a dozen steps to the readout just trying to get the door open. I tried to trim the plastic tab, but I took too much off, now the door flops open. It was useless the way it came from the factory, now I broke it and can't use it at all without a rubber band to keep it closed. Also, I was never able to get a very accurate step-count. I would count 100 steps and usually get 65-90 steps on the readout, though I'm not really sure because I had to shake the thing for a minute or two just to get the door open. For the price, I think this would be a great deal for someone with the patience to work with it 
At this price, we got pedometers for the whole family. My 9 year old son has worn his every day since. It is interesting to see how many steps you take in a day. We did not set the pace length as recommended, but other than that, it is ready to use immediately - just clip it onto your waistband. Shows steps, miles and calories burned. My only complaint is that the front cover is a little hard to flip open 
great product, easy to use and simple to follow instruction, keeps me in the zone to burn calories while on my walks. i recommend it to anyone. it doesnt interface with gym exercise equipment but i dont use them anyway and it doesnt cost 3 to 4 times what one of those do. buy it, wear it, be happy 
I have had Omord HR-100C for a few months now. I use it wile on my treadmill. It seems to take a wile before it starts to register the hart rate; I think it is because the sending unit needs some moisture to make good contact with your skin. I did have some trouble with the unit when I first started using it; I replaced the battery in the sending unit which solved the problem. The fact that the battery is user replaceable is one of the main reasons I picked the Omord brand. The HR-100C is a bare bones unit and does a good job if you are looking for an inexpensive basic hart rate monitor 
Great product for the $ I spent. I picked it b/c I can replace the batteries myself and the cost was in my budget. It does jump around more than I'd like, but I can tell from the range that I am over or under my target heart rate. It does beep to let you know that, but I find it annoying so I turn it off. If you find you have trouble getting it to register your rate, then move it around a bit. Mine works best when I put it higher on my chest, in the area of my heart, just below my shoulder blade. 
I have two Omron prroducts. the heart rate monitor and a blood pressure untit. Both have been very satisfactory products 
This is the perfect HRM for anyone just trying to monitor their heart rate. Directions for set up are very easy. The price for this HRM is pretty cheap compared to others. Comes in a great storage zipper bag. If you need something with more features like calorie counting, average heart rate, etc. then you need to looke elsewhere. Now that I can keep track of my target zone for weight loss I have lost 10 pounds in one month. Seems like I was not working hard enough. The alarms are really great and let you know if you are not working out hard enough or workin out too hard. I have purchased two already for myself and girlfriend and both work properly and they do not seem to obstruct with each other. Great buy for beginner or advanced 
HRM works great, much better than my Polar HRM(battery went dead right away). Unfortunately, the watch stopped working, display showed time but didn't change and none of buttons worked. Wasn't battery as power was needed to display the static time. Sent to Omron for repair. Things happen. When working it's great 
I use this monitor when I ride my bike which is daily at a local state park where I live. It works fine... the strap that goes around the chest isn't uncomfortable and its wireless. Another feature I like it comes with a rubber grommet so I can attach the watch to the bicycles handle bar... then its just a matter of looking down to keep track of the heart rate... overall... I would say for the price its a good value. 
This really works. You must put on a strap that functions as the transducer. It has a small radio transmitter in it that sends your heart rate to the wristwatch. Included is an adapter that allows you to mount the watch on your treadmill handle. I like it a lot. It works much better than the optical system that I had before. It often would not work if there was a lot of light in the room. You can easily adjust the strap. It doesn't have to be very tight to get a good reading. 
I finally found a product that works for me, after trying too many other products. I tried Magic Shave powder but couldn't use it no more than once a month (damn thing reeked, too). If I didn't get all the hairs, I'd be toast. I would have to use a razor for finish the job, which defeated the purpose of not getting ingrown hairs. I tried the Magic Shave creamer, and that didn't work either. I would get most of my beard, but if there's anything left over, I'd be in the same position having to use a razor to finish. I tried Norelco (received that for Christmas) but couldn't deal with my hairs being pulled (ouch!!). I bought a beard trimmer by Wahl to cut my beard to the skin, then used Magic Shave razor. It worked but still got razor bumps (not as bad) and sometimes bled. I was vacationing in Florida with my friends who visited his sister and brother-in-law. His brother-in-law happened to be the neighborhood barber, and he used this razor on my face. I got so enamored, went I got back I went online and bought it immediately. Since I know my face very well, I realized I can only use this shaver at the most twice a week. I used this since February of 2006, and it's been wonderful. I give it four stars because, even though it works like the product says, I do get a little bump here and there. All in all, I do recommend this product for men that suffers in-grown hairs. Please note, after reading other reviews, usage is individualized. In other words, know what your limits are in terms how many times you can use the shaver. You might be able to use it daily or weekly 
Suffering from razor bumps both on my head and face and due to the fact that I'm in the military, I can appreciate a razor that will limit the amount of bumps I get. The Remington ES-1000 does limit these bumps by shaving at the surface. Due to this fact, you might want to shave two times in the day; once in the morning and again during lunch. Since I'm in the military, this is necessary for me. The shaver in and of itself will not give you a "smooth like razor" look. You will need the assistance of an application like Williams Lectric Shave pre-shave splash to get that effect. Other than the frequent shaving, this shaver does limit the number of razor bumps you will get if not eradicate them all over a period of time. 
My beard hairs are extremely curly and I have struggled with ingrown hairs and razor bumps ever since junior high. I never liked the way I looked with a beard and I always wanted to be clean shaven, but my curly hair didn't allow me to shave more than once a week or so. If I shaved more often, the ingrowns and bumps would go out of control. As it was, only shaving once a week still gave me huge problems. I had resigned myself to always looking scruffy. Until I found this shaver. Instead of cutting the hair beneath the skin level (where it will cause bumps since it will curl and grown beneath the skin), this razor cuts the hairs just above the skin. What does this mean for me? For the first time in about 14 years, I am able to shave WHENEVER I WANT. My ingrowns have completely disappeared. I feel like a new person and I love looking clean-cut. Thank you Remington 
Very good one. Bought for two months for everyday usage. Works like a charm. Better than my previous 20-dollars one. Would recommend to buy this 
It works very well. It seems pretty accurate. My wife has taken it to the doctor to compare with his monitor and it's very close. I recommend bringing it regularly to your doctor's appointments to insure accuracy. I don't think you could go wrong buying this product. We're very pleased with it 
Outstanding quality, consistency and accuracy! At the end of the day that is all you can ask from a blood pressure cuff (sphygmomanometer). A few things to bear in mind: In consecutive readings done at the same time, you will see a trend from higher to lower blood pressure as you "learn" to lower your own pressure. Also, your blood pressure at home will be lower than that you obtain at your doctor's office until you learn to overcome the anxiety normally associated with the doctor's office. This is normal and is one of the main reasons to obtain a home blood pressure monitor. Also, your pressure will fluctuate from day to day and even during a blood pressure monitoring session. So don't automatically assume that the gauge is not giving accurate readings! Trust me, it is. This monitor has been extensively tested against measurements obtained at the doctor's office and has been determined to be as accurate a method of determining blood pressure as you would obtain at the doctor's office - actually, more accurate since the anxiety factor is eliminated. So if you are looking for the best home blood monitor device on the market look no further. Just made sure and trust it! I heartily endorse this product 
Machine arrived promptly and was easy enough to use, even for a first time user. Price of this unit was MUCH better then the same unit at the pharmacy 
I bought this cuff on recommendation of my Md. My HMO tested it to be among the best. I've used this BP cuff almost 100 times now. It appears to be consistently reliable, and has been accurate when tested against standard cuff results. The ComFit Cuff is much easier to use than the previous "D" ring kind. The only negative I can say about it is that it is sensitive to any movement during use, and you need to use it with your arm positioned with elbow on a stable surface. Otherwise, it will give an "error" message. I am an RN, and I strongly recommend it. I also think it would be easy for most elderly adults to use. 
This Omron Blood Pressure Monitor is OK, but not as good, in my opinion as my old one from the same company. This one doesn't print out results, although it does store them. Also, the cuff is very stiff and cumbersome. 
The product was delivered promptly and operates as advertised. It is light in weight and easy to use 
I didn't received the model which I ordered. My order has been replaced twice, but it still didn't send the corrected one to me. Thank you 
I am very happy after gifting it to my mother in law. It has shown good results and its pretty accurate. We use it mostly with battery. Nice device over all 
This product works just great...the only thing that I don't like about it is that when I first opened it up, my daughter tried it out before setting the date/time feature and now I can't go back and correct the date/time. So, be sure to set it correctly before your FIRST USE!! 
This blood pressure monitor is accurate and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone 
I'm so glad I purchased this product! It's so easy to use and the memory is good for record keeping. I highly recommend this product to anyone that needs to keep track of their blood pressure. 
It is a good product. I bought it for my parents and so far they did not have any problem with error messages or inaccurate readings. However, one cannot measure the blood pressure on your own you need someone to help you put the cuff on your arm.I wish it was more easy for someone to do it by themselves and have it position well too. Overall a good product to buy 
Item received in perfect condition. Checked with Doctor. Very good blood pressure monitor. Thank you 
A very good protein bar. The cookies and cream is very tasty, yet it is not too sweet. I find that the Builder's Bar has one big advantage over the regular Clif Bar (other than the protein of course): the Builder's Bar isn't super sweet. I really enjoy the regular Clif Bar but sometimes it leaves me feeling like I just ate a really sweet candy bar. The Builder's Bar doesn't suffer from that. The downside to the Builder's Bar, however, is that it does have a bit of saturated fat. In sum, not a bad bar and much tastier than many of the other protein bars I have tried 
I personally am addicted to these bars. I tell myself they are much better than regular chocolate bars and I do believe that. I actually prefer the taste of these to regular chocolate bars. 
I bought these because I love the regular Clif bars. I ride my bike to/from work, so I thought I would use these as a kind of "breakfast replacement". They taste very good and they definitely hold you over until lunch. Although, I highly recommend having a glass of cold milk handy to wash it down 
I'm 26m, 6' 185 and growing. Work out regularly, mostly weights and basketball. I'm allergic to peanuts, which makes most protein bars off-limits for me. This is the only bar I've found where the non-peanut flavors don't contain trace amounts of peanuts to set off my allergies. Incredible, if for only that reason. But there's more. 20g of protein. Wow. This can be a meal replacement if you're on the road or it can be the mid-morning, early-evening or even late-night snack, especially if you're trying to build lean muscle and shooting for 1.5 or more grams of protein per pound of body weight. It's an easy 20. The carbs are real, as another review says. It's clean energy, to be effective either before or after a workout. I prefer to take in liquid protein after a workout, the body absorbs it faster, but in a pinch this would be a great choice. Beyond that it's a little crispy and a little chewy, there's a physical satisfaction from eating it that makes the experience complete. But, as another review said, this isn't intended to be a diet bar, it is for men women who work hard and use lots of energy throughout the day, hence the name "Builders Bar." I guess if you ate half of one instead of a meal, it might work that way. Finally the taste is outstanding, when stacked against other bars (although I haven't tried many, due to peanut allergies). If you close your eyes and pretend, it really could be a dessert. I stick to the cookies cream or chocolate. Chocolate is yummy dunked in hot coffee mid-morning. I buy a box every two weeks and keep stocked at home, work and oftentimes one in the car just in case I get hungry. Another review said the outside chocolate got crumbly, this is true, if it gets hot and melted. When the things solidify they crumble. Doesn't change the taste but it's messy. Keep them cool and you're in good shape. I've even tried putting them in the freezer prior to eating, not bad but no significant difference. Thank you Clif 
I read in Bicycling magazing that riders who ingest protien within the first 15 minutes of completing a ride, have faster muscle recovery rates and are in better shape for the next day. Last year I was always sore the next day after a long ride. After reading this article, I box some Clif Builder Bars due to their high protien content (20g). I have since been religiously eating them after each ride. I have yet to have sore muscles yet this year. In one of the local stores there is a Chocolate Mint flavor. It is yummy. 
I'm giving this a '4' because my husband likes them and took them from me to use after his weight lifting work-outs. But I tried one first: the outside chocolate was a bit crumbly probably due to shipping and storage. The taste was fair to real good for a high protein bar that doesn't use a lot of sugar alcohols to sweeten it, depending on your taste for such things. In other words it's not super-sweet but the sucralose (Splenda) gets the job done, if I remember correctly. It is SUPER for keeping you from getting hungry due to the fact that it has real carbs, not play carbs in it, to match it's high amount of protein - probably could be used for the Zone diet. You can last hours and hours on it. It's more than a meal. (This is NOT a dieter's bar, although with careful planning could be used as such.) We've tried a lot of bars and this is the best high protein bar yet that doesn't rely on sugar alcohols (otherwise, stick to South Beach Diet Bars. 
Graet for consumers who want to get more protein in their diets without having to sacrifice the benefits of all-natural ingredients or great taste. Truly works 
These are the basic Flexisoft EB17 heads for adult users of any Braun Oral-B toothbrush (even the newer 3-D models). The blue bristles will fade and help indicate when replacement is in order (in case you don't see the bristles splaying out). Always have a pack around, nice for guests too. Prices vary, but about $5 per head in packs of 3, 4, 6 is a good value. These standard EB17s may be too firm for younger brushers. Search for the Extrasoft EB17 for your kids, they're essentially the same as those packaged with Disney or cartoon characters at a more reasonable price. (Do you need to pay $2-5 more for a picture Sleeping Beauty on the brush head?) 
I love the braun oral b toothbush for several reasons...A main one being the small heads on the brushes. While it may not be the one my dentist sells it is the one I use - with its small heads I am able to easily brush even the back areas... I always have a pack of these extra heads because you should change your brushes every few months and seeing the new ones in my closet makes me remember. I LOVE that they are color coded and the main unit can be used by many members of the same family. I find the brushes firm enough but not course...and my gums are not bothered by the heads at all. In fact they feel very good. I love this brush and having the replacement heads around is perfec 
This is a great product, easy to program and use.. easy to read digital display and very accurate 
The scale part works fine, but the fat % measurement does not work. If you care about fat%, I'd recommend using the hand held device instead. It gives more accurate reads. 
I compared this body fat monitor to similar ones from Tanita. You are definately getting more for your money here. It stores up to 4 users where the Tanita models only store 2 and compares function for function elsewhere at a lower price point. Not to mention that this scale just feels like better quality when you pick it up. I bought one with one of the Omron Pedometers to take advantage of the instant rebate on Amazon. (I haven't seen an event on Tanita on Amazon for a while.) The pedometer was the #1 rated in CR. They are both top notch products 
These are a great, yuumy snack. For someone who counts calories (or points), it's nice to have an option that is relatively healthy and still tastes great! I have never met a Luna Bar I didn't like, though this is my favorite flavor 
These tasty bars have 100% of your RDA of 10 vitamins and minerals and at least 25% of 11 other vitamins and minerals. They are filling so make a great "breakfast bar" if you are in a hurry. They make a great snack for an adult or child who doesn't eat properly and/or forgets to take a daily vitamin. I have tried most of the flavors and have enjoyed them all 
The chai tea bars are my favorite. The coating on the top is a mix of creamy topping with cinnamon and ginger, but not overpowering. I used to be starving a couple hours after breakfast, hours before lunch....one of these at 10 o'clock sees me through even past my normal lunch time. It's packed with calcium and other goodness women (and men) need. If you're expecting some gooey mess you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for some tasty nutrition, this is it 
These bars are supposed to be for Women because they are lower cal and have more calcium. I think there are other factors as well. Men are usually affraid of products like vitamins for women stangely enough, but they say that they need calcium and protein too. I really like the key lime flavor it is great. I like lemon also and the chi tea. I like those flavors because they are light tasting and I do not always have to have chocolate the way some people do. The lime reminds me of the florida keys. These are really better than the original cliff bars and when they came out I did not eat another man ciff bar. I used to eat one of these for breakfast everyday with a soy milk when I had a busy life. Thankfully my life has slowed down now. It is good grab and go food 
These bars taste delicious. It is fairly filling as a between-lunch-and-dinner snack, and for only 180 calories. Plus, it's almost like a multivitamin because it has a huge percentage (often 100%) of the daily recomended values of a lot of the vitamins you need! And 30% RDA of calcium! wow! !!! and again, they taste soooooo good. 
These are very tasty. They take care of a sweet tooth without all the unpronouncable ingredients or being terrible for you. They also are great in a diaper bag, purse, center console of a car for when you get hungry and need something to tie you over until you are at home or whatever your destination 
I like the fact that the infation is manual so less chance of malfuntioning. History feature is very convenient and very easy to operate 
This is a nice looking easy to use device. I wanted the simplist unit without air pumps and the need for chaning out batteries all the time. You Just turn it on, wrap the cuff around your arm, pump up the air bulb and let it go. The unit takes your pressure and pulse as it deflates 
This thing is awesome; easy to use, accurate, and long battery life. I use it most days in the morning to take a few readings and the batteries are still going strong eight months later. You could buy a fancier unit, but I didn't see the need. It fits my arm fine, but the band does seem a little small. You'd probably have buy the optional larger arm band if your arm is any bigger than average circumference. For this, I'll give it 4.5 stars. I really don't see why the band couldn't have been a little bigger. No more to say other than that I agree with the other positive reviews totally. If you are looking for the most bang for the buck and simplicity, make this your choice. 
My only complaint is that it doesn't beep. I know this may sound strange, but my other one beeped the heartbeet and when it was finished. I just got used to it. Other than that, no complaints 
Every time I use the product--- 3 out of 4 times I receive an error and have to try it agai 
It is really good enough for my need. I have no problems so far 
Useful Easy to use Good price I would recommend this product 
It does what it advertises. The bodyfat readings do fluctuate, but that's normal, it gives you a good general idea of how much bodyfat you have, and it gives a simple reading of whether your bmi with your body fat is low, normal, high, too high. I got it for about 25 bucks so good buy. 
This is a great hand held body fat analyzer. Very accurate, consistent readings and very user friendly. It takes about one minute to set up the personal information that it needs and takes a few seconds to get the body fat readings, very fast. I was a little worried about buying this item because the lack of reviews but did notice another Omron HBF-306 fat Analyzer that had alot reviews. I don't know why this item doesn't have as many reviews as the other Omron HBF-306 fat Analyzer, when it is the exact same product, plus what made me buy this one instead of the other is it's cheaper and free shipping. So overall great product for the price 
Consumer Reports just ran an online article on the Philips SCD 589 Baby Monitor, putting it through an "extreme" test, and it delivered with zero interference as promised. The highlights: "We devised a worst-case scenario to test the SCD 589, placing three models within 20 feet of two new Philips 1.9-GHz DECT cordless phones to see if they would interfere with each other... The SCD 589 lived up to its claim of being free of interference, even in our extreme test. There was no interference heard on any of the phones or baby monitors in our test... The SCD 589 also had some nice, if hardly essential, features the other models in our tests didn't. Those included a nightlight; an "intercom" that allows the parent to speak to the child remotely; and an alarm that sounds when the temperature in the child's room goes out of a certain range that parents can set." 
Very handy that you can put it in your handbag wherever you go. You can use it to read those tiny words in the label when you are grocery shopping. Better than magnifier glass because the width of this bookmark covers the whole line of a page 
I just purchased the 40 oz. size. The cap fits well and seals well. The company told me that all the different sizes use the same cap now, so there is no fit problem. The bottle is well finished and strong. Easy to drink from. It is wonderful to be using stainless steel now, and no longer be using Nalgene, which is polycarbonate plastic, and a possible health hazard (bisphenol A) 
I HAVE BEEN USING PAMPERS SINCE DAY 1 WITH SWADDLES IN THE HOSPITAL TO PAMPERES CRUISERS NOW.THEY ARE THE BEST AROUND.NO LEAKS EVER NO RASH 
This is one of the few diapers that has never leaked! Love that aspect.... 
The product is excellent, the Cadillac of diapers. It arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition 
very soft and strong diaper. my bb loves it. hold quite a bit, no leak for over 12 hrs at nite. I used it on my bb since 3.5 months and now he is 7 months old. 
Cruisers provide a good fit with almost no leaking. They're comfy on our little guy. We have tried other brands and prefer this one 
I think pampers fit well on the ever-moving body of crawling babies! They are absorbent and leak proof. These are a good fit and a good price 
I used to love Huggies Supreme diapers- until they switched them to this GentleCare or NaturalFit with HugFlex... and honestly they are terrible. The plain "old" Supreme diapers were the best, and now I can't even get them at any store in town anymore. SO I switched to Pampers Baby Dry, which are about 20 cents per pack cheaper than Pampers Cruisers. Those were the most terrible diapers I have EVER tried. Nearing desperation level, I tried Cruisers, and I'm glad I did. They are almost as good as the old Huggies Supreme diapers. I love that I can get them with free shipping from Amazon - plus if you enter in the codes on the inside of the packs you can get free stuff from the Pampers website. Not bad 
OK, is it me or does anyone else find it a little strange that a book company is selling diapers and paper towels? Just askin' 
I am glad to have this product. It works well and I do not need to use it often, save time. An absoulte epilator that is safer than just using the regular shaver because it cut my skin few times and scare marks on my skin and hair grows thicker. This product can minimize your hair grow and thinner as well. It works better than average for this price, great buy! 
I will not say this is the best epilator ever, but if you are ever in an emergency need for hair removal, and don't want to ruin your body with a razor, this item is good to have on hand. It's not a replacement for waxing but is a great substitute. Plus, if you feel like shaving is your only option, it does have an interchangeable shaver head as well. Basically it's your overall emergency feminine travel tool for beautiful smooth hair free skin. 
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS. I GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER FOR HER BIRTHDAY AND SHE LOVED IT. GREAT PRODUCT 
It's a very good product but it has some real problems... thinner hair is very difficult to remove, and over the knee hurts a lot!, the bikini and under arm head doesn't work very well. It's not what I was expecting but I am happy with it, it wasn't expensive and you can use it while you watch tv like I do 
My girlfriend was well-satisfied with this product even though the manual she received was not exactly for that model (ES2025V) and that is why I rated this item 4 stars 
I have tested this scale against several others and none are nearly as accurate. I have moved this scale around the house and tested it on wood, tile, and carpet. It's always accurate to within .1 lbs, just as advertised 
definitely an eye catcher in the bathroom. Besides it needing a hard stomp to turn on when supposedly it needs a tap, it works great 
The scale indeed looks very nice and sleek with its glass design. The quality seems to be quite nice, and it's designed in England. There's a 10 year warranty in case anything goes wrong. The scale is very accurate, but I agree with others about the tapping issue. I have to more like "hit" it with my foot to get it started. Make sure you wait until the 18888 turns to 0 before stepping on. The 18888 means it's calibrating the scale to 0. You have to keep very still for the weight to stabilize. Or else it will just keep going up and down, although you'll be able to get your weight within the half pound before the number stabilizes 
Accurate, Accurate, and still accurate - that's it. I never got a scale accurate like this. And it's stylish, beautiful, and convenient. It worked for me immediately after I opened its box : 
This is a great scale and very accurate. I have no problem with this. I also had a difficulty to turn it on first, but after I read the manual, it was easy. It is very accurate and 9/10 gave the same weight with .1 pound (one was off by .2 pound) You need to tap it for making it vibrating. Don't just tap since it won't turn on, but if you tap it just like you softly hit it so the top glass vibrate, then it will be on. 
While I'm a big fan of Hooah bars, this particular flavor tastes like apple jolly ranchers. No kidding. If that's okay with you, then go for the apple flavor. I'd recommend the chocolate 
Bar tasts good and delivers an energy boost that lasts. Much much better than eating candy bars. Excellent buy and better for you than candy bars. I will continue to buy this product. 
I love these because they're delicious and just the thing for getting me through a long workout. They're also perfect for traveling, easy to pack, and sustain you during an all day hike or touristy walkabout. A friend of mine in Iraq says he eats them twice a day, for the taste, and also because--and I agree--he trusts an energy product designed by the military for soldiers much more than an energy product designed by a private company for profit 
When I go out at nights I meet a lot of people. I like to be the centre of attention, which means I have to be louder and more fun than the DJ, the music, the flashing lights and everyone else in the places I go to. Its a lot of fun but drains my energy. I often find myself crashing half way through the night. I run out of steam, feeling hungry, dizzy and (worst of all) I loose my spark. The only thing to then is to leave and grab a bite to eat. Typically I feel bloated and sleepy then. So I'll often call it a night. The fun is over - which sucks! I needed a different way to do things. I experimented with candy bars, oatmeal bars and energy bars. None of them worked - they just delayed the crash a little. The Hooah bar was the last one I tried. I say it was the last one, because once I tried this I realised I didn't need anything else. I tried it out on my birthday. I have to admit the whole "developped by the military" thing made me curious. But after failing with all the other bars I didn't have high hopes. I took two bars with me that night. Around midnight the familiar signs that I had depleted my energy stores started showing: I felt a little dizzy, I got a few hot cold flushes, my stomach felt like it was going eat itself soon. The thing is I was having far too good a time to leave (I had a party of 7 people hanging on my every word - something which does tremendous things to boosting the old ego!) Instead of bailing - as I might have done, I just popped open the Hooah bar and ate it as I carried on. Within minutes my hunger pangs disappeared, my blood sugar levels balanced out and I felt back on form. The best thing is that I didn't feel bloated or tired afterwards. It was exactly what I needed. I know that I will be taking a Hooah bar with me every time I go out now 
I have been using HOOAH bars now after a workout before I play some sports and it helps me have enough energy to get through and perform as best as I can. I also eat it before a competition and I find myself having enough energy to constantly keep up with the other team. I highly recommend it. It is sweet though and somewhat addicting to eat like a candy bar 
This is the only energy bar that I have sampled more than once! The Hooah! energy bar works faster, lasts longer, and tastes better!... Both flavors!... Go Army! 
Reading some of these comments, and after sampling a Hooah bar, I can understand why these bars give you long lasting energy. They're oily and sugary. Lots of sugar for quick energy and the oil stays on the stomach longer so you don't feel hungry quickly- that's why much of fast food is so popular, it tastes good and its satisfying, but it ain't necessarily good for you! The recipe makes it sweeter, and certainly oilier, than eating an ordinary candy bar. I think a Snickers tastes better. For those who are using these as meal replacement bars, I'd be real careful. The bar might be 'balanced' but it isn't a meal. Whatever energy bar you consume, they're good before a workout or post-workout for recovery but don't confuse them with a proper meal and all the components found there. As for me, I prefer an Odwalla bar or Cliff bar. Less grease, true natural ingredients, less hype 
I have tried several "energy bars" and have found Hooah to be the best at doing what it says it will do, give me steady energy. Most other energy bars that I have tried, pick me up and then knock me down a few hours later. I feel confident feeding them to my family too. My 8 year old son races motocross and eats one before each moto. My daughter eats one before cheering at football games and before her 4 hours of dance lessons. My husband, a contractor/builder, eats one before a hectic work day. I have to keep up with all of them and sometimes don't have time for breakfast or lunch, I just grab a Hooah bar and I am set. They are like bread and milk in our house, if we are out, everyone is mad at Mom. Since we have several friends and family members in the armed forces, we also like the fact that a portion of each sale goes to the military. Thanks Hooah! 
Compared to the energy bars on the market these days (Cliff, powerbar, etc.) that taste terrible, Hooah bars are awesome. They really work too, energy wise. Great for long bike rides, triatholons, etc. or even something to eat before practice for athletes. They are awesome; I am a huge fan 
Better-tasting than almost any candy bar, good for you - what's not to like? Best snack product for the serious chocoholic looking to rationalize his/her intake. Try it 
This is one of the best-tasting energy/snack bars I've tried. It has true flavors (think a chewy chocolate brownie with small chocolate chips), little or no "off" flavors or aftertastes, and it's relatively filling, especially if accompanied by water or an additional quick snack, such as fruit. It's a small bar, but it's packed with 3 grams of fiber (12% of daily needs based on a 2,000 calorie diet), and it's certified 95% organic. These organic ingredients include organic rolled oats, organic oat Flour, organic oat fiber, organic and milled flaxseed, and actual natural flavors. Even the sweet stuff is organic:, including organic chocolate (made with--you guessed it--organic evaporated cane juice), soy butter, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, tapioca syrup, and fig paste. CLIF's website proclaims that "CLIF ZBar is the first kids' snack created to comply with SB-19, California's Senate Bill limiting fat and sugar in foods offered within the state's school system...We source ingredients which do not contain wheat and are not genetically engineered." Although aimed at kids, adults and teens will enjoy this as well. Ingredients: Organic Rolled Oats, Organic Chocolate Chips (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors), Organic Evaporated Cane Juice Syrup, Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Organic Tapioca Syrup, Organic Fig Paste, Organic Oat Flour, Organic Cocoa Powder, Organic Soy Butter, Natural Flavors, Organic Oat Fiber, Organic Milled Flaxseed, Organic Chocolate (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin), Salt, Baking Soda. For those with allegies, CLIF includes the following caution "Contains soy. May contain traces of milk, peanuts and other nuts." Vitamins Minerals: Calcium Carbonate, Ascorbic Acid (Vit. C), Niacinamide (Vit. B3), Ferric Orthophosphate (Iron), Zinc Oxide, Cyanocobalamin (Vit. B12), Thiamine Mononitrate (Vit. B1), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vit. B6), Riboflavin (Vit. B2), Folic Acid (Vit. B9), Beta Carotene (Vit A). Nutritional Information: In one bar (36 grams) there are 120 calories, 3 grams of fat (5% of percent daily values based on a 2,000 calorie diet), of which one gram s saturated fat(but no trans fat), 0 cholesterol, 12 grams sugar, A total of 22 grams carbohydrates (7%), which includes 12 grams of sugar and 10 grams of other carbohydrates, 125 mg of sodium (4%), 110 mg. potassium(3%), 3 grams of dietary fiber (12%) and a gram of insoluble fiber, and the following vitamins and minerals: Vitamin A (6%), B1(30%), B2 (15%), B3 (20%), B6 (20%), B12 (10%), %). C (35%), Iron (10%), zinc (15%), Phosphorus (20%), and Folate (20%). I don't think there's a similar product around that can compete with the taste, purity, and nutritional value of this popular new treat 
My son likes the taste and I like what's in it! This is a great snack to help school kids make it to lunch. Organic inputs, no hydrogenated fats and healthier sweetners make this a better choice for kids.

The Clif Bars were great- my only concern is that it seems like there was a lot more packaging then necessary for the product that was shipped. Thanks. 
If I had kids, I'd be stealing these out of their lunch bag. Cheeky bastards! I get afternoon chocolate cravings and can't scarf down Snickers bars everyday (at least not if I'm spending most of my day sedentary in an offic chair). The zBar Brownies offer all the satisfaction of chocolate with the wholesomeness of oatmeal. Ok, so it's not as rich and creamy as something from Hershey. But they are damn good without olestra, saccharine, and other ingredients that will embalm you. And the #1 ingredient is Organic Oats. The #2 ingredient is organic chocolate chips. If that wasn't a good enough start, all the other ingredients are organic too.  1 bar = 1 serving 120 calories 25 calories from fat 1g of saturated fat 0g trans fat 0mg cholesterol The biggest downside is 12g of sugar, but that's still doing better than most sweet snacks. I love these bars because they are tasty and filling. They are a "healthy" alternative to the tempations in your local vending machine. Cheers 
This was a present I send to my aunt *80+ years old, she can read much better now ! 
I have been using this product for my electric razor for over 4 years. I find that it gives me a closer shave, and extends the life of my razor head and cutters 
I have tried nearly all brands of energy drinks. Hooah! are the best tasting and they give me the most energ 
Like another reviewer, I've experienced great stuff with this product. Let me tackle the beverage from two angles: 1) Taste. The stuff looks like lightly-green tinted water, but the flavor is a mild diet sweetness. Not like the raw high fructose surge of soad, but kind of a tangy tastiness that I personally enjoy. It's nice cold out of the can, though people have asked me if I was downing a Coors due to the silver exterior. 2) Energy. No caffeine, no guarana, no chemicals. Yes, sugar, but for some reason, no crash and burn. I just had my second one of the day about two hours ago (9:30PM) and I'm still feeling pretty good, considering I've been awake and working for 14 hours straight on. No coffee or other stimulants, so I'm crediting the drink. Hooah 
This energy drink is perfect for those late nights when you need a mental boost to get you through a few more hours of work. As a writer often under deadline pressure, I've relied on caffeinated products like Coke and Red Bull for years, but invariably they make me jittery and I have a hard time focusing. Not so with the Hooah drink...like a friend giving you a leg up onto something, it helps me make it through more work than I could on my own, and my brain doesn't feel all frazzled like the neurons are in the midst of an aimless firing frenzy when I drink it. My focus actually improves, which makes sense given that it was designed to keep soldiers alert through life or death situations 
I'm writing to correct a few factual errors in other reviews. One reviewer claimed that Soldier Fuel contains no energy ingredients. This is untrue. Soldier Fuel was formulated by military labs specifically to provide steady energy to troops. Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy. Soldier Fuel contains 29 g of complex carbs (the carbs that give long-lasting energy) and 12 g of sugar. The U.S. Military labs deemed this the perfect ratio to give you both a quick burst of energy and no crash. Most other energy drinks on the market have lots of sugar and caffeine. Since caffeine is a stimulant and not a source of energy, the result is a quick spike in energy followed by a crash.  Another error is that Soldier Fuel has more sugar. It has less. One 12 oz. can of Soldier Fuel has 12 g of sugar. The same amount of Gatorade contains 21 g of sugar. The same amount of Red Bull has 39g sugar. Finally, the support for the troops is not marketing hype. Our company is partnered with the U.S. Military's Natick Soldier Center. A portion of the gross proceeds from each can of HOOAH! Soldier Fuel and each HOOAH! bar directly funds research that improves the safety, diet, and quality of life of our troops 
I love this taste even better than the punch:tropical. It's so smooth, so light! U.S. Military scientists say it improves mental alertness up to 50%. I think they're right. Kudos U.S. Military! Being next to Camp Pendleton I love that this supports our troops 
I must say, this is the best energy drink that I have ever tried. My 8 year-old son races Motocross and drinks energy drinks on busy race days. He often has me take a sip of whichever one he is drinking. He loves to see my face crinkle up and laughs when I say, "How can you drink that stuff?" There was no funny face when I tried this one. This drink tastes like lemon water. It doesn't have that "thick syrup-y" texture that many others have and there is no bitter after taste. After tasting it, I read the label. No Caffeine, 45% of the daily value of vitamin C--Hooah. You can bet that these will be in my fridge next to the milk and OJ. I have finally found an Energy Drink that I can confidently pack in the motocross and cheerleading gear bags. My 5 year-old even likes it and feels like "a big girl" because she is permitted to drink "Motocross Soda". I am sure I will be breaking up many fights over who gets the last Hooah! Thanks Hooah!! 
I purchased this toothbrush in spite of the single semi-negative feedback and have been very pleased with its performance. I also received the "Hot Pink" model but since I generally don't brush my teeth with a lot of folks watching it doesn't present a problem for me-- at least not one that affects its ability to clean my teeth and remove plaque. For the price this is a fine product and I expect to get many years of use out of it 
I discovered the Hooah drink because my boss--a retired military man running for office--always has a case lying around. With campaign season heating up and workdays getting crazy long, these are invaluable...help us all stay on our feet when we have to and fend off that sluggish brain function that comes when you haven't slept a full night in eons

First tried HOOAH! bars at last Summer's Carlsbad Triathlon. Love the bars, had to try the drink. Taste delicious!: light, cheerful taste--nothing acrid--goes down smooth. They keep me mentally awake WITHOUT CAFFEINE OR TAURINE, way to go U.S. Military! Those military scientists know their stuff! HOOAH! (I love saying "HOOAH!") Love that this supports our troops, HOOAH! 
I saw these guys at the outdoor retailers show in SLC and tried there drink and bars. They are the best I have had. I was working 16-20 hours a day and tried redbull and othe products and felt great for an hour and then had to grab another. I tried these drinks and wow I was more alert and just awake not buzzing or anything. The next bext thing was the taste. It reminds me of the fruit punch you get at the fountain in the gas station. It tastes great. I cant wait til they get this stuff in the stores but for now I will order it here and let all my friends try it. This stuff is Great thanks HOOAH!! 
My doctor requires me to take an anemia test every week. Between the time it takes at the doctor's office, the high cost of gas, and missing work my quality of life was diminishing. My doctor mentioned that Biosafe has an FDA approved anemia test I can take in the privacy of my home. I purchased the test from amazon.com and the results were identical to my doctor's test! This test is perfect if you need a quick and simple blood test. Thanks Biosafe, you have truly made a difference 
Happy with price and product. Very very easy to use; fast and accurate 
easy to use.it seems quite accurate.the only bad thing is it needs batteries,which cost a lot 
This monitor was easy to set up and use. It seems to be very consistant and accurate. BUT...it squeezes my arm quite a bit harder than any hand-pump wielding nurse or physician I ever met! It is rather uncomfortable. Has anyone else had this experience? Any comments? I've tried adjusting the cuff looser and tighter - doesn't seem to make a difference. The 'squeeze' is still uncomfortable. My arm tingles lightly for about 20 minutes after a test 
Great product, simple to use. For some reason, it didn't work for the first couple of times, even though the straps were in place as described. Had to start/stop couple of times before it started measuring, great product, good price, simple to use. This model does not come with an ADAPTOR and there is no information whatsoever about the type of adaptor needed. Would like to know the ratings but no information is available, the only option seems to be, buy an adaptor from Omron, which is very expensive. This product would not be used in US and I haven't yet been able to figure out whether it would support Worldwide Voltage 
This BP monitor is a Godsend for my Mom, who has arthritis in her hands and can't use the pump type machines. She is very happy with it. Very fast shipping and a great buy 
Well made, easy to use and seems accurate. A lot of value for the price. 
One lancet, three drops of blood.... it's as easy as that. The test results are accurate and prompt. What a wonderful test! 
The claim that the test requires only a couple of drops of blood is grossly inaccurate. In order to comply with the instructions at least a dozen drops of blood are required. I needed three finger sticks. The results were consistent with the laboratory results I get through my doctor and the results I used to get with the now-discontinued Choice A1C Home Test. I mailed the blood specimen on a Monday from New Jersey to Biosafe in Chicago and received the results the following Monday. Biosafe's privacy policy is very weak and their laboratory authorization form is intrusive. I declined to disclose my Social Security number and e-mail address. 
The charlatans who makes this [...] deserve to be shot and so does anybody stupid enough to buy it. Eat a balanced diet and get some exercise. Don't be a moron all your life. 
I heard about this product through a friend and I was skeptical at first. I usually don't mind diet food or drinks that taste bad but the first taste of this I did not like it! To me it tasted like someone sprayed the inside of the bottle with Pledge and then put water in it. It may be a taste that you either like or don't like. I am one who does not like it, but I came up with the idea to add Crystal Lite (the To Go packs in Lemonade or Raspberry Lemonade are my favorite) and it is so good! it adds 5 calories but it is worth it! I still get hungary but i find myself getting full fast and not even finishing a meal. It may be in my head but if it works I dont mind! Also I buy mine at Target when I run out. 
I drink a lot of bottled water. It does NOT make me feel full - sometimes quite the opposite. Of course, drinking water before or during the meal lessens the chance of overeating, but the effect of the Skinny water goes beyond that. I love its taste because it is not overbearing and too sweet like other citrus-flavored water I've tried. It replaces my soda and curbes my apetite pretty well. I also bought a bottle for a friend of mine. He was wondering why he wasn't getting hungry for a long time, and only later realized it must have been the Skinny water. It costs quite a bit. However, bunch of drinks cost about the same and have negative impact on your body. So, even if this is a placebo effect (and, fankly, I don't care as long as it works), I think it's worth it. You'll have to judge for yourself. I can't afford three bottles a day, but will buy this water sporadically, most likely from my local 7-11. I would like to point out that most of the people who wrote negative reviews here either didn't like the TASTE of the water, or NEVER TASTED it in the first place. Of course some people don't like the taste - you can't please everybody - but it bears no relevance on its efectiveness! As for people who review stuff without trying it... well... they obviously don't understand what review means, and too bad their preconceptions count towards the overall score for the product 
This "water" was for a friend who like (and drink) it frequently. It must me good for her ... but it's hard to find in a nearby store. So I ordered it for her via Amazon.com ... waiting - waiting ... and finally one day before she left country (by plane) it arrived. At least she took 3 bottles with her .. 
I was very dissapointed with my purchase, as the citrus taste of the water was absolutely terrible and I just could not drink it, so there's a whole case sitting unused on my porch. Waste of money 
The Skinny Water had a light refreshing hint of lemon taste. It definitely curbed my appetite! Maybe too well, I actually had to remind myself to eat! I just made sure I drank 3 bottles through out the day and didn't necessarily follow the instructions about drinking before meals because I was on the road alot. I researched the the Super Citrimax and found scientific research to support the claim of increased fat burning. It was noted to alter carbohydrate metabolism with the effect of lowering insulin production. I drink bottled water anyway so it is nice to know I am getting an extra metabolic benefit. 
I've been using a $120. dollar Phillips/Norelco shaver for about a year and I changed the rotary blades once. My skin was becoming irritated to the point of, hell with shaving I think I will grow a beard. Well to make a long story short I was told by my wife and son that I looked about 10 years older. That was all it took to push me to look for a better shaver. The Braun 360 Complete is like night and day comparing it with rotary shavers. It shaves alot closer in half the time! Plus it cleans itself and tells you (by the LCD)at what time you should put new foils and cutters, ( about 18 months). Absolutely tears up rotary shavers 
This is the fourth Braun shaver I have owned, and this is clearly the best. Yes, it is a bit expensive, but you use it everyday and my last shaver from Braun lasted over six years and survived year long deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq in 130 degree temperatures. This shaver is the quietest I've used and cuts my beard in less than three minutes. The cleaning system is much better than the last system and the shaver always stays fresh and clean. I am not sure the message display is necessary, but it does tell you how long it took to shave each time and tells you how much battery charge is left. The 8975 model is probably just as good as the top of the line 8995 model, but I liked the idea of the larger message center and knowing how much of a charge is left. The Gillette blade is very nice and cuts through my thick beard like butter. I am very satisfied with this shaver and will purchase other Braun shavers in the future 
The best shave I've ever had, but not perfect. Even though my face feels smooth afterward, it still shows some shadow. I'm not sure if any shaver can completely remove my tough beard. The Braun does an excellent job especially on my neck, which I have never been able to shave to my satisfaction. The unit is powerful so time spent per shave is short. The cleaning system is superb and doesn't involve too frequent fluid changes. The refills are inexpensive anyway. I don't regret the purchase. Too bad the cleaning system is not easily portable 
I bought it new. After using this shaver a couple of times in a shower, it stopped working. I took it to a Braun affiliated repair shop. Braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior, including the electronics. They said this is NOT a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me. I checked the manual before I used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower. I have not opened the shaver, I have not cleaned it in water. Thus, based on my experience, this shaver and Braun are a scam as far as I am concerned 
For many years I Couldn't use a electric shaver because it was always a incomplete shave, so after each Christmas when I received a new one I would try it and would go back to a manual razor, THEN came along the freeglider and yippy it did a reasonable job that I would call satisfactory, the over the years That razor went obsolete so I started to look for a new replacement. I read some of the reviews. I read "the refills are costly ... hello... 4$ a month?, then I read doesn't do a good job, Well let me report to you all this is the best darn razor, Its like magic each time I use it(cleans itself each time" its quick, comfortable , quiet, the cleaning process is so cool and I for one love the concept of a clean razor each time I use it, this razor is 10 times better then the freeglider which I loved, what a joy shaving now is , I can even shave twice (I go to work sometimes at 3am then later that night if I'm going out I can shave again and it doesn't irritate.. what a magical razor they have designed .. PS. The cleaning solution is not expensive (under 12$ for 3ea, that's 4$ apiece and lasts a month). thank you to the designer I highly recommend this 2 thumbs up cons none I can see as yet .. John 
Newest Braun just got better. Been using them for years and will continue 
This product really works. I had a dry and scratchy throat and tried this and was impressed with how fast the symptoms went away. I now carry this with me at all times. I highly recomend. With the cold and flu season soon upon us, I suggest everyone have some Simply Gargle close by. Fast effective relief from sore throat! Thanks again! 
I had never heard of this stuff before, but I decided to order some anyhow due to the single serve packages and me constantly being on the run. I am now a HUGE fan of the product. It works incredibly well and the convenience is a life saver for gargle. I am not sure why nobody has thought of this before. It tastes great as well. I must say...it is hard to find in stores, but I will jsut keep buying from Amazon as needed since they generally have pretty low prices on this type of product. Love to naturals!! 
Was up late at night with a persistant sore throat. Found this item and ordered online. I was able to use it at work the next day about 5 times and it was great. It felt as if my grandmother was in the kitchen stirring up a gargle mix with salt and water. I guess the added herbs in the formula worked 
This bar tastes pretty close to a dessert bar. I would buy it again 
I love this thing. You do have to stop exercising to take your pulse, but I use it mostly for biofeedback. It is so great to use when I'm having a panic attack and cannot keep count myself. What I love most is that it's not expensive, but you don't have to wear any sort of strap around you!! And you can wear it just like anyother watch 
This device is useless for monitoring pulse during activity. One must be absolutely still for the meter to get a clear signal. Nor is it useful for monitoring resting pulse, as it seems unable to pick up a pulse unless the heart is pounding. At best, this device MIGHT manage to acurately read a pulse AFTER a strenuous activity is concluded 
My wife and I have used this a few times now and really like it. From a novice's point of view, this is a great meditation aid. I like being able to get the visual feedback as I calm and center myself. I guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as I try to accomplish the task in front of me. It's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack 
This is a fantastic tool for self improvement and relaxation and a flawed but acceptable game by gaming standards alone. The biofeedback hardware/software is excellent and you WILL make progress whether your goals are stress reduction, better meditation, building higher self-esteem, maybe even reaching higher states of consciousness etc...The "biofeedback events" are diverse and well designed and generally just great to use! Most of the in-game advice is also fantastic and there are a few "easter eggs" which offer very practical tools to help build your self esteem, realize your goals etc...Much of the *substance* of this project is masterfully achieved (though there are a few cheesy moments). That said the interface etc. needs help, it can be downright frustrating, and the relatively low-res graphics can be a strain on some screens. Thankfully these issues have been addressed in the expansion pack Wisdom Quest, which I also highly recommend. Overall, this is a really innovative and great product. Also a good investment as far as biofeedback devices go since there will likely be more expansion packs and third-party software to come 
I have practiced deep breathing relaxtion techniques for many years, and thought that I was able to control my heart rate and blood pressure. My last visit to my Dr told me otherwise. Even after deep breathing exercises my diastolic was still a little high. After using WD for a few days I realized that my deep breathing techniques that I had been practicing was all wrong. With Wds help I am able to truly relax to lower my stress and BP. If you buy this and treat it like you would a regular computer game with the same expectations of achievement in getting to the next level, you will be very disappointed. However, if you use WD as a way to achieve true relaxation quicker than you thought was possible, then you will love it just as I do. By using WD I am able to relax quicker with every use. I finished the game in two weeks, but still revisit the relaxation exercises almost every night. Just ordered the next installment "Wisdom Quest", and can't wait to learn new techniques. If you buy the Journey to the Wild Divine, give it an honest trial and I am sure that you will not be disappointed 
I returned this biofeedback software and hardware. I was happy with Amazon's quick credit back to my credit card, but i found this purchase totally lacking. The games it had you play were boring and i wouldn't suggest buying this for doing biofeedback 
I was skeptical of this program at first, but had a chance to demo it for several days at a conference. It's compelling and fun to use. It's also accurate-- at one point I was focusing on relaxing and allowing some balloons to float slowly across the bottom of the screen. Someone came up behind me and startled me and the balloons jumped up to the top of the screen in time with my reaction. My only complaint is that parts of it are a little slow and talky. It's well worth the expense if you're interested in developing your mind/body communication, although probably not as valuable for someone who is already well into that 
Just to warn you, if you have never meditated before with a biofeedback machine you are in for a surprise. My first few times meditating(before I purchased this game) were great...but then, it became harder and harder to achieve the original calm after that, not only that, it took longer and longer to achieve even the slightest amount of relaxation. Then out of desperation, because my anxiety and self-consciousness were once again running and ruining my life, I bought this game. Now I am always relaxed and I can reach calm in minutes and stay focused for hours throughtout the day. It is amazing how the biofeedback, music and interest in trying to play the game can be so effective...again you will be amazed. However, I did struggle the first few times trying to get into a groove, but once you hit that groove it stays around and is easy to obtain. I would say that it probably took me about 2 hours to hit my first state of calmness. That sounds like a long time and it is, but the game and the biofeedback make the time pass. The second time playing I was already calm and moved through the game rather quickly. The third time and beyond I am able to succeed at the challenges pretty quickly compared to the first time. I am always calm now..which is a wierd experience for me..and always feel focused. Even little babies and animals come up to me now...just kidding.  For type A personalities I would just read the comments and lower your expectations for how fast you should succeed at this game. You will definitely need patience, but once you are calm..the pace of the game is just perfect. The frustration and patience will be worth it. Meditation is so such a simple process that it leaves with the impression that it can be obtained instantly...o' contrare, meditation requires mucho patience...and if you read this far in my comment you probably have the patience to succeed,and again, it is worth it 
I finally received this product in the mail after knowing about it for a year. I can't say I'm a huge fan of Deepak Chopra. He presents some good ideas, but from what I can tell he seems to consider meditation to be more of a mechanism for mind and body control, leading to bliss and relaxation, rather than a tool for unbiased self knowledge, to come to terms with all the things that one rather might ignore. I find this bias is reflected in the game. As a game in itself, it is pretty good - its graphics and its originality - and learning to relax and chill out may be useful for some people. I didn't find the process as compelling as I expected, though. I found I was able to learn some of the skills pretty fast, and other places I seemed to get stuck. One potential drawback is that if you get frustrated, and try to start forcing things to happen, it can defeat the purpose of meditation. The science of biofeedback is fairly new, and I can see its potential in the field of preventative health. I just wouldn't put the same New Age spin on things as Chopra does. 
I was very pleased with the test. It came quickly and the instructions were clear and simple. Once I sent it in to Biosafe Laboratory the results came back within a couple of weeks. 
Very happy except a travel case would be nice. Too many loose parts otherwise. Have not tried using it in wet conditions 
The bodygroom is excellent. I used to trim my chest with Wahl trimmer. Compared to the Whal, the Bodygroom is weightless, way easier to reach all over your body, no fear of using in the shower (waterproof and cordless) for faster disposing of hair, easier to clean in the shower after done and easier to store, just hang it dry right next to the shower. It will make you go hmmm 
The bodygroom lives up to the manufacturers promo. It does every thing norelco says that it will do with ease. The first it i received had a problem. I contacted norelco and it was replaced with out a proble 
I was a little skeptical when I first bought the Bodygroom, but I have to say that it was definitely worth the money. The first time I used it, it was extremely comfortable and easy, and the areas I shaved ended up being almost as smooth as if I had used a razor. It's easy to clean and recharges quickly. The only drawback is that it doesn't work as well after you've used it for a while. I'm not sure if it's because the blades dull quickly or if it's just normal wear and tear, but you just have to be a little more careful because it's easier to nick yourself when it's worn a little. Overall, however, the Bodygroom is a great tool for trimming and keeping the groin, chest, and underarm areas smooth 
The product does what it should do. I did find that it was a good idea to take my time when trimming sensitive areas. Move too quick and it pulls a little. Other then that I haven't had any issues 
At first I was kind of skeptical... I've used many razors both electric and none electric.... but NOTHING compares to just how awesome this works. I was done in no time! No nicks, no bumps, no stubble... worked better than great! It works exceptionally well on the "certain skin sack" without pulling or cutting. WORTH IT 
You can shave anything without putting future fatherhood at risk, though it takes some patience to get things really smooth. I've used it repeatedly over the past three months without any major problems. My skin was a little sensitive after the first time, but no terrible pain or anything, and there's none at all now that I'm accustomed to using it. It is possible to nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving, but if you read the instructions first you should be fine. A couple of very minor drawbacks: It's rather noisy, more so than a regular electric razor, and if you use the comb attachments, it's tough to remove them without also removing the foil screen at the same time. But that pops right back in, so not a big dea 
This is a very good shaver for the private area. However, the key to getting the best results is to trim the longer hairs with scissors or the largest guard first. This will keep the shaver from pulling on the longer hairs and will enable the foil part of the shaver to work. The foil will not be able to do its job if the hairs are too long. The only problem I had with the shaver was that it did not enable me to shave my back like it claimed. However, I use the 'mangroomer' back shaver for this and it is perfect for you to shave off all your back hair easily with its elongated handle. it is a great product as well. Therefore, I would have to say these two products coupled together seem to cover all the bases for men's grooming on the body. I would highly recommend both of them for perfect manscaping results 
This is one top shaver for the body. I have experienced no pulling anywhere. It is totally safe on anypart of the body, with a clean close shave or trim. You can't go wrong with it 
Very easy to understand. The talking feature works very well. We left ours in a cold car that was below the recommended temperature. The defib. voice instructed us how to get it functional again. We are very pleased with the ease of operation 
Contrary to what John Stevenson said in his review, you cannot administer a shock to someone who does not need it. The device has a built-in monitoring function that only allows you to shock when it detects the inproper heart function 
God willing, I won't ever have to. When I do need to use it, I hope it is easy. If it's too hard, the consequences could be dire 
I was employed by a major airline as a flight attendant. Our company was one of the first to madate AED's onboard. Because of my experience, I would recommend this product, but ONLY if you are in a risk group. The key to survivablility of a cardiac arrest is the response time to medical treatment. An AED can close the gap between the incident and the arrival of professional medical assistance. Minutes of delay can mean death or brain damage. This was my experience with an AED. A passenger suffered what appeared to be a cardiac arrest. There were no professional medical personnel onboard other than the well trained flight crew. For those that think that flight attendants are onboard to serve coctails and peanuts, think again. The beauty of the AED is the precision method of monitoring the patient's vital signs, then advising proper steps. This helps to alleviate human error in administering first aid. After assessing the vital signs of the patient manually, we hooked him up to the AED. The system advised a shock. One was administered, which restored some heart rhythm. We were able to continue artificial respiration until the aircraft landed and medical personnel arrived. The passenger, while he did not regain consciousness onboard, did recover from his cardiac arrest. The timeframe of surviving a cardiac arrest is measured in just a few minutes. The AED offers a helping hand in a crucial situation. If you are in a risk group, I'd recommend this product. 
I grew up seeing my grandma's dentures in a glass on the bathroom sink. So far, with the Oral B Power Toothbrush I have been able to avoid that fate. Anyone who wants to keep their teeth should use this product!! 
Necessary replacement brush heads to maintain correct oral hygeine with rotary Braun electric toothbrush. I foung Amazon.com's price for this item CHEAPER than Costco or Sam's Club!!! 
Came within a few days. Cost was about $7.00 less then our local retail stores 
This is a great price compared to what's available in stores, although the product itself, like all brands of power toothbrush replacement heads, is ridiculously overpriced 
This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said "this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth" or some such statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet. The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing. Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it's kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination. Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness. Enjoy life 
It is a Good and very handy test. Problem is the lancets and it takes 7 days minimum to get the Results. Lancets is a big problem though 
The Biosafe Thyroid Test is accurate and simple to use. The results came back in less than a week and matched my doctor's results! Thanks Biosafe 
The TSH test kit was easy to use and the steps were easy to follow. I had problems with the needle device in that the prick to my finger was too small and I couldn't get even one drop of blood to come out. I called the number listed for help and they sent me a bigger needle in which I had no problems. The results came back within a week 
Yes, the kit is easy to use, but if you don't bleed freely, get a few extra lancets before you start. Most pharmacists will give you one or two lancets for free. The kit only comes with two (which can be used only one time). It took me 6 jabs to get enough blood for the test; I had to run out to the corner pharmacy to get more lancets (because I'm too much of a whimp to find a household bloodletting tool). Other than that - no complaints. The lab got the results back to me faster than expected 
The product worked great, results were fast and accurate. I reccomend this product to anyone 
I definitely agree with the previous reviewers that this test is easy to use, self-contained, has very clear instructions, etc. I'll also add that the support is GREAT. They have a nurse practitioner there to take your questions if you have them and they have operators that help out with any other questions. I've had nothing but great experience with this test, and it's been helping me monitor my TSH levels as I come OFF of Synthroid through use of Acupuncture and Herbs. I highly recommend this product!! 
I use this test kit very often to monitor my TSH level. I report all findings to my doctor to keep her informed. I like not having to pay the high cost of traditional labs. The test kit is very easy to use and virtually pain free. The directions are precise and clear. They send your results with a graph so you can chart your progress with each test taking. All supplies needed are enclosed in kit, even the prepaid return envelope. All supplies are disposable and are designed to be a one time use only. No contamination concerns. Very recommended product. Great customer service dept. and knowledgeable staff of nurses available by phone if you need one. Make sure you follow the directions for ease of collection of blood.Very quick results that are easy to read 
This was easy to use and received test results in the mail 
These tasty bars have 100% of your RDA of 10 vitamins and minerals and at least 25% of 11 other vitamins and minerals. They are filling so make a great "breakfast bar" if you are in a hurry. They make a great snack for an adult or child who doesn't eat properly and/or forgets to take a daily vitamin. I have tried most of the flavors and have enjoyed them all 
The chai tea bars are my favorite. The coating on the top is a mix of creamy topping with cinnamon and ginger, but not overpowering. I used to be starving a couple hours after breakfast, hours before lunch....one of these at 10 o'clock sees me through even past my normal lunch time. It's packed with calcium and other goodness women (and men) need. If you're expecting some gooey mess you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for some tasty nutrition, this is it 
These bars are supposed to be for Women because they are lower cal and have more calcium. I think there are other factors as well. Men are usually affraid of products like vitamins for women stangely enough, but they say that they need calcium and protein too. I really like the key lime flavor it is great. I like lemon also and the chi tea. I like those flavors because they are light tasting and I do not always have to have chocolate the way some people do. The lime reminds me of the florida keys. These are really better than the original cliff bars and when they came out I did not eat another man ciff bar. I used to eat one of these for breakfast everyday with a soy milk when I had a busy life. Thankfully my life has slowed down now. It is good grab and go food 
After reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the Luna Bar flavors, I decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself. I noticed that the Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil. If you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor. The toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious, doesn't taste like a candy bar, and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages. Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market. 
The Cherry Covered Choccolate Luna Bars are quite tasty. Chances are, if you're eating a chocolate cherry nutrition bar, you need a little enticement to eat healthy. Like all these bars you do get sick of the same flavor day after day. I recommend alternating between these and another bar that's not so sweet (kashi trail mix bars are perfect). That helps me stick to the bars instead of hitting up the zillion calorie pastries at the corner coffee shop 
These bars taste delicious. It is fairly filling as a between-lunch-and-dinner snack, and for only 180 calories. Plus, it's almost like a multivitamin because it has a huge percentage (often 100%) of the daily recomended values of a lot of the vitamins you need! And 30% RDA of calcium! wow! !!! and again, they taste soooooo good. 
I had never eaten a Luna bar before I made this purchase, so I had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled. When I read "chocolate Pecan Pie" .. I expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate, with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base. What I received was a bar with little taste, nothing at all similar to the name on the bar. In my opinion, the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it... the flavor is barely there. The bar is dry. It is never again be on my "purchase" list 
I love this chair. I come home from work every night and sit for two cycles. It came before the delivery range had said it would be here. I had looked for some time, and had sat in them many times at Sharper Image, so I knew what I was getting 
I love my iJoy chair. It gives a better massage than anything else in the sub $1000 category. I figure even if it lasts me 1 year, $600 for about 300 massages isn't too bad. I can tell it is built really well, though, and I expect it to last a lot longer than 1 year. The preprogrammed routines are very useful for getting a general back massage. It also has the ability to concentrate on a specific area, which comes in handy as well. The chair comes in an enormous box, and is easy to put together...less than 30 minutes 
Love my iJoy chair... Just like the Commercial but Bigger!! Not a cheep vibration but actual rollers!! It even reclines back 
Buyer beware. Great chair for one year then the motor died. The warranty is one year so I am out of luck. If you think $600 is a good deal for one year's use of the chair then this is the chair for you 
The Omron MC 514 Thermometer works terrific. I am a nurse and the thermometer is very accurate. I use the thermometer at work, but will probably pick one up for home use as well. 
I bought this from Amazon and I don't like it - I need to take 5 or 7 measures to be sure about the values, The diferent from the firt measures to the 7 measure is 3 degrees, I have a baby 6 months old and for me is a problem to take a lot of measure. In conclusion IS TO BIG INACCURATE. 
I have verified the accurracy of the Omron HEM-637 and found it to be very close to what my doctor said my blood pressure was. It is very easy to set up and use, The history feature is great, and my old eyes find the screen easy to see. I would purchase another one if I had to do this again 
Easy to use and fool proof to where to place monitor because of the beeping when placed at correct level with the heart. Check out the same as the doctors. 
I bought for my mom. I want to buy one for myself too. It's good for no medical background people 
The HEM-637 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with advanced poitioning sensor is VERY easy to use, accurate (I have checked it twice at Sams Club and Weis), consistent and the case it comes in makes it very portable to carry with me. I recently went off blood pressure medicine and was checking my pressure several times a day to ensure it didn't spike. Love, love, love it! 
I find this to be an accurate and easy to use machine. I like the memory aspect of it. 
My husband uses this machine anywhere from 3 to 5 times a day. It is a lifesaver. 
After trying many brands of BP cuff, this is the first one that was truly accurate. I took it into my doctor's office to check it against the office readings, and they were right on! Unkike others that had been up to 30 points off! There is a great memory on it too---you can keep records of a month or more! Easy to use and set-up can be for either right or left wrist. Buy this one and don't bother looking further. You won't be disappointed 
We got this product five weeks back for my mother. Its not too intuitive, for my mother, as far as the 'intellisense' is concerned compared to the Omoron manual BP monitor we owned previously. But once you get a hang of it does its job fantastically. I would prefer manual BP monitor for older folks over the 'intellisense' 
This is a plasic frenel lens. One side has grooves that if you look sidewise on, or edge-on, you will see a sawtooth curve radiating from the center. To create a 3X convex lens this size in glass would weigh a number of pounds. Wash with lots of soap, and air dry. Easy to scratch. This was invented for stage arc spotlights, due to exploding convex glass lenses. Audiences were showered in glass shards. Advantage--light weight, flat[may be carried in book being read], wont shatter 
These pull ups are really small. It's like they put the wrong size in the box. My child leaked all over the place last night in bed. What a mess to wake up to??? Too small for the size that they claimed that they are. It looked more like a size 3. Would not recommend buying these tiny pull ups!!! 
Yipee. Thanks to amzn/UPS the replacement heads arrived just in time; especially since I had trouble finding this product locally 
What can you say about a toothbrush? If you own a Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush, you'll need these. This deal is a lot cheaper than buying the individual ones 
Although I'm happy with my purchase of these Oral replacements, I have to admit they do leave me feeling raw in my area when used for more than 5 minutes. While they're no match for the original, they still get the JOB done 
This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said "this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth" or some such statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet. The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing. Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It's kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination. Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness. Enjoy life 
I have tried nearly all brands of energy bars. Hooah! are the best tasting and they give me the most energy 
I've tried a lot of energy bars and this is the best tasting. I am however partial to peanut butter. Cliff bars were my favorite, but these taste much better and that have a bit of crisp to them. The Cliff bar is dry tasting by comparison. I would have given this bar 5 stars had it not used palm oil. This ups the saturated fat, which I need to watch. Corn surup not the best thing to be ingesting either but since I am working out and burning it off its proabably not a problem. This bar has the lowest sat. fat (2g, 10%RDA) than their other two bars and the most potasium. The later is important to me because it may help ward off my leg cramps. I agree that the vitamins is probably a marketing ploy - after all, anyone who exersizes regularly probably takes a multivitamin. I'd give it 4-1/2 stars if I could. 
I love these because they're delicious and just the thing for getting me through a long workout. They're also perfect for traveling, easy to pack, and sustain you during an all day hike or touristy walkabout. A friend of mine in Iraq says he eats them twice a day, for the taste, and also because--and I agree--he trusts an energy product designed by the military for soldiers much more than an energy product designed by a private company for profit 
Again, I am a fan of the Hooah Bar, even more so now that I have finally been able to try the Peanut Butter Bar. At first taste, this bar reminded me of the candy that my "Pappy" used to share with me when I was a child. This bar tastes like a "Bit-O-Honey" or "Mary Jane." It tastes like a treat, but still gives me the energy and stamina that I need to make it through a busy day. I would highly recommend this member of the Hooah Family. Keep Up the Good Work, HOOAH 
A very fine product for a reasonable price. Full page magnifier assists those with visual problems to read with less eye strain. I am able to read smaller print books and articles I have been missing out on. A great help 
This high powered toothbrush helps you brush better. However, it is not magic. You still have to know "how to brush." It is also much more messy, using this kind of toothbrush, but the dental hygenists strongly recommend them 
I have used this toothbrush for 2 months now, so while I cannot really comment on subjects like longevity or reliability, I can say that it functions perfectly. Firstly, it cleans teeth and gums SO much better than manual toothbrushes, or my one previous electric (Bausch and Lomb Interplak). An experiment that I tried that you can duplicate (if you have any interest): eat a "problem" food that usually leaves bits stuck between your teeth. For me, this means blueberries (the skins) or tuna. Brush with your manual brush. Then rinse and spit several times, until no more debris is coming out. Now floss throughly and then rinse and spit several times again. How much more debris do you get now? This is what your toothbrush did not get. Now try it again with the Oral B. With the Oral B brush, my mouth FEELS much cleaner, and I end up with much less food left for the floss to get. I chose the 7550 because I wanted the Oral B "3D Brushing Action" mechanism at the lowest price, and when I looked at the various models for sale, it seemed that the major difference between them (that was not just gimmicks) was the number and types of brush heads that were included with each model. I figured that since these were expendables, I would be buying more of them over the years anyway. In the end, the 7550 with the four brush heads that are included and 6 refills that I bought at the same time cost less than some of the fancier models with fewer heads. The build-quality seems first-rate, the action that combines oscillation with in-and-out pulsations is very effective, and my teeth are thanking me 
I know there are higher end power toothbrushes available , but for the price (~$40), I don't think this one can be beat. Much better than manual and the two minute timer is a great feature. Stand/charge is also very convenient. 
So far so good on this product. We'll see how long this one lasts 
I have been used electronic brush for over 3 years now. I am tired of changing batteries in my old electronic brushes once a few weeks. The Oral B 7550 sets its price at a acceptable range (I bought it when it was on sale), for about 35-50 dollars, I think they would be your number one choice. The decide is very decent, and everything works out quite well. With this set, you don't need to worry about changing batteries, just charnge it once a week would be fine (when the battery is in new condition), I am expecting it could last for about 3 years, so divide the price down to per year, it is really cheap. (I know that the brush heads still cost additional money) If you like using electronic brush like me, choose this product will be good to go. I am not a rich guy so I avoid buying those product cost like 50 to even more than 100. They do almost the same things, so why not just get the basic functions. As long as it can clean up your teeth, that is the most important function I am looking for 
This is a nice easy to use toothbrush. Lots of power and holds a charge pretty good. Best way to use is to let the battery drain down before recharging. After maybe five days of use, twice a day, you can feel the battery will need to be recharged for maximum power. I like the fact that it only has a two-minute timer and will NOT turn off after two minutes. I don't need a toothbrush with too many bells and whistles. Only annoying thing for some would be the blue recharge indicator light that stays on while charging. I use like a night light for those middle of the night bathroom excursions. No more being blinded by turning on the light 
This toothbrush really gets the job done. The feeling of your teeth being so clean is really incredible and pleasant. I find myself licking my teeth all morning, and I can't wait to get home at night to brush them again before bed. Awesome! As I have learned over the course of my experiences, having a clean mouth and good oral hygien can be a real booster for you personal life, and can make having intimate relationships a lot easier to get into, enjoy, and enhanced 
Now that I'm writing this review, it seems silly that I'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush. But I am. I bought this item not long after I had my first (and hopefully only) root canal and crown four years ago, something which I never again want to experience in my life (as someone else described, it was painful and expensive). Growing up, I didn't take care of my teeth like I should've, so I'm accustomed to always being told there's either a cavity, or the start of one, and having to have more work done. After the root canal, my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations/oscillations, because that's what she'd been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums. This specific item met those requirements, and it was affordable. When I first started using it, my gums were very sensitive to it, but that quickly wore off, so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums. It is also MUCH easier to get behind the front teeth. Subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one (I honestly don't remember if she has this exact model, but ours are similar), and I've not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since I purchased it. As far as cleaning the unit to keep it from "gunking" up, I'm the only person who uses this item, so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in, not dripping into the storage container; so I don't know how to combat that. But I just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it, then rinse the hand-held part, and set them back on the unplugged charger/base (I only plug it in when the battery runs low) and things stay clean with no problem 
Wow 5 blades instead of three? Who would have thought of that? I smell noble price here! Don't let the great cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades. I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face. The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance. I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing. By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn't test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal. What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades? I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the "adding more blades" thing is getting exhausted. 
The first shave seemed good; but the second time did me in with the Fusion. Instead of just one nick, I managed around 3 or 4 nicks at once. But looking at the cost of the replacement cartridges was enough of a shock to look for a cheaper alternative to shaving. I purchased a Merkur Futur German made adjustable safety razor it only about costs 40 cents or less for each Merkur razor blade they are alot sharper! The Merkur Heavy Duty safety razor is supposed to be a great beginners safety razor is also highly rated! One can even get 100 blade bulk packs of Derby Extra double edge blades for the Merkur on Ebay which average just around 16 cents or less apiece. The Sensor was more practical for me! In my opinion, Gillette must think we all are willing to pay the high prices for these Fusion blades the new modern 4 bladed shave. Lately, there seems to be a trend in more men going back to a good old fashioned shave using the double edge safety razor! I wonder why?  
Life is good and the batteries work the way they are supposed to work. Good value 
Great batts! Makes owning battery operated devices much less costly. Thanks for offering this product 
For the price...you can't beat Rayovac. Blow away those cheap "heavy duty" batteries and last almost or just as long as the premium brands. Amazon's price seems like it is the best other than Wal-Mart...who is priced about the same or just a little lower. Well worth the spend! 
Until I bought several weeks worth of Rayovac Alkaline D cells, I used Duracell Alkaline D cells. Every week I run a 3-CD changer (JVC _CX-XC370) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes, at the same volume level (Volume #10), from Tuesday to Thursday. The Duracells lasted all 11 hours (and might last even longer). In contrast, these Rayovac D cells for the last three weeks (maybe four weeks) have consistently died during the second half of the next-to-last class (after hour 9.5 and before hour 10). 
For once, I don't have to do a "public service" by going to clifbar.com and looking up the ingredients and nutritional information; Amazon.com has it all at the top of the product page. Now, I can focus on taste! That's a good thing, because this (along with the Clif Z-Bar, chocolate) is one of the better tasting "nutritional" snacks of its kind. It has just enough chocolate (brought to you by chocolate chips (which include organic cane juice, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa butter, and unspecified "natural flavors") to actually impart a chocolate flavor. Not a heavy or rich chocolate flavor, but an unmistakable one: You don't have to close your eyes, and convince yourself that it's chocolate. (Ever notice how permeable artificial flavors can be? Let's say you're eating a Popsicle--excuse me--a frozen fruit treat. You close your eyes, and the flavor clues are all but gone. Think purple, and its tastes like grape; think orange, and it's orange, think light blue and it's bubble gum--if you know the code, that is.) This is like a giant Bit-O-Honey candy, it has that chewy texture over laden with honey, with some sticky peanut butter and chocolate thrown in, and you've pretty much captured the flavor. To my surprise, there is no honey, that taste derives somehow from the syrups, malt, cane juice, fig paste, and other sweet ingredients. It's definitely filling, especially if accompanied by an apple or something, and at least eight ounces of water. It's very chewy, yet it doesn't seem as dry as similar products. Could it be the six grams of fat-two of which are saturated? Yes, two grams of saturated fat! NOT good. I'll try to balance that with the fact that it's made from 70% organic ingredients, has a whopping 11 grams of protein, only 20 grams of sugar (compare that with other brands and flavors), and includes five grams of fiber. Along with Clif's Z-bar and the excellent Clif apple raisin walnut, this is one of the better tasting of its kind--just don't expect a brownie 
I received the product quickly, it was in great shape, and I will buy more as soon as I eat all these up 
Clif Bars are amoung the best tasting energy bars I have ever tried. They may not pack as many calories or grams of protein as other brands, but there have been times where I could not even finish a competeing bar because of dismal taste or texture 
The best sports bar around. Great taste, organic, contains plenty of Antioxidants, and contains a good amount of protein. The only down side is the high amount of carbs, especially the sugars, but I still give it five stars 
Clif Bars have been part of my families life for a long time and provides a good quick meal or snack depending on your activity level. Definitely recommend having water available 
I've tried many types of nutrition bars and many are too sweet or they are not tasty. Clif bars get it right 
I eat one of these twice a week before I play ice hockey. I specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine, though I don't perceive any "boost". It could be there and I'm just not noticing it. I feel they do the job of keeping me fueled for the workout. It would be nice if the package made a specific recommendation about how long before a workout to eat the Clif Bar. I find the size of a Clif bar a bit disappointing, especially considering the "store" price of $1.50. At $11 a case and with free shipping when spending $25 or more, I've not found a better price than Amazon's on Clif bars 
I took Passion RX because I am 31 years old and have a very low sex drive and no passion. I had great success the first week I took this product. In fact I was so pleased, I bought 2 more bottles. However, the second week, I went back to having no sex drive. And even though I am continuing to take Passion RX, it has not had any effect whatsoever since the first week. I take 2 pills each day in the morning, and have done so for over a month. I suppose everyone is different but I won't purchase any more. Plus I just saw a webpage from Consumer Health Digest that gives it low rating compared to other products: http://consumerhealthdigest.com/top25female.htm?source=overute/Passionrx=passion%20rx=passion%20rx=standar 
This is a variation of the classic pre-shave lotion, but in solid form. Main ingredient is parafin, a petroleum destilate grounded to a very fine powder and molded thru extrusion into a solid bar. Once it touches your face skin it pulverizes again and remains in the skin as a fine lawyer of talc-like powder. Contrary to apparences it lubricates the skin almost flawlessly. Of course if you press the electric shaver to much it will burn your skin! Nonetheless this is a high quality product (Made in Switzerland) that is why is rather on the expensive side, but it certanly delivers 100% on its intended use and purpose. I always keep 5 o 6 bars at one time in stock, because I know it's too good a product before it substituted by a chinese cheaper import 
After trying many pre-shaving products I found this to be the best one. The only problem is that it is hard to find, when I do I usually buy several 
This is a great product, have been using it for years. Tried other dry methods and they do not work nearly as well as this product 
I've been using this product for years. I can only use an electric shaver due to my sensitive skin. The powder forms a thin layer on the skin that allows the shaver to move a lot easier across the face while shaving 
I purchased several of them and it is burn free rash free, and easy to apply you do not have to use your fingers etc to apply it, and one sticks LASTS AND LASTS. It really makes shaving a joy, and not a chore, I just love using it and you will too. It is by far the BEST of the BEST pre-shave product on the market 
I have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down. As other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base. It makes dry shaving extremely smooth, as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess. You can use this with any type of electric, not just Remingtons, and it's very easy to clean out, just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush. Highly recommende 
I really liked this product,so smooth,noiseless.very easy to use also less efforts required to remove hair......i will go again for it..... 
I bought this one for my wife and she was really happy about the product. She personally like the product and really good 
This razor is similar to the men's Gillette M3Power Razor. It uses one AAA battery, and it vibrates. One blade should last approximately three months in this razor. It requires little or no effort to remove hair with this razor. This razor can be used to swiftly remove hair from armpits, legs, or any other place a goddess can think of. Thank God for goddesses 
I've used all the Venus women's razors and this is my favorite out of them all. This is the only razor I've used out of the line that hasn't nicked me or cut me or left stray hairs. It leaves my legs smooth 
I was so glad to receive this before my son gets here. This keepsake chest will hold lots of different-sized items, and it is just beautiful! I got the matching photo album and baby book as well, and all items are high quality and so cute 
I really love the Keepsake box. The top opens up to fit the matching baby book right in it, to make a complete set. It is going to be nice to be able to pass this down to my daughter 
The cutest keepsake box. Has a flip-top lid which perfectly fits the matching record book, and has two drawers below that, one of which is divided into sections for smaller keepsakes. The bottom drawer is a good size to store the matching photo album too. On the lid is a frame for you to place a picture of your little one, that says "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" all around the frame. An excellent value, and it's very sturdy 
These bars are so delicious, you will be worried they're just candy bars. But they're not! They are packed with energy and nutrition that will keep you going and keep you healthy too. The flavor variety is unmatched on the market. The Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip Peanutbutter are my favorites, but the Oatmeal Raisin Walnut is also excellent, especially if you are hiking and have a canteen of water to go along with their very natural deliciousness 
They have a lot of vitamins in these suckers. I mean we're talking Vit. A, Vit. C, Calcium, Iron, Vit. E, Vit. K, etc. I don't know what all those nutrients do exactly but it shouldn't hurt. The only problem I have is that in this variety pack, the Crunchy Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch flavors are a little too similar that they pretty much taste the same to me. If you like peanut butter - great! If not, then probably try a different box but still try a clif bar out 
Clif bars make for a tasty and pleasant snack. They are perfect when you simply don't have a lot of time to get something into you to keep you going. [...]they are an excellent source of vitamins C and E. They are very chewy and satisfying; you won't need more than one or two before you workout. They are much more nutritious than a candy bar, too. However, this snack bar is not perfect. As another reviewer notes, there is quite a bit of sugar, carbohydrates and fat in each bar. This food bar is not for anyone on a salt free diet as it contains salt; and people with allergies to any kind of nuts should definitely not eat this food. Overall, Clif Nutrition Bars are useful for those of us who are not allergic to any of their ingredients and who want a healthier alternative to a candy bar. The Amazon price makes them affordable and I recommend them as a delicious snack food. 
If you are looking for new ways to incorporate soy products into your life, Clif Bars are one of the best tasting energy bars on the market. I've given up trying other bars that are mostly disappointingly filled with all sorts of oils I can't eat. Take cottonseed for example it is in everything! Not to mention, peanut butter and all the palm kernel oil saturating the health bar market. The ingredients in the Carrot Cake Bar: Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Soy Protein Isolate, Rice Flour, Malt Extract, Organic Soy Flour, Organic Roasted Soybeans, Organic Rolled Oats, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Dried Apples, Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors, Apple Fiber, Oat Fiber, Organic Milled Flaxseed, Chicory Extract, Psyllium, Organic soy Butter, Dried Carrots, Raisins, Coconut, Sea Salt, Nutmeg, Cinnamon and Cloves. Each bar is 240 Calories and is delicious for breakfast with a cup of tea. I eat a Clif Bar almost every morning and never really feel overly hungry during the day. Gary (The Owner of Clif Bar Inc.) seems to have also found out that "other" energy bars were not really that tasty. After his "epiphany," he spent lots of time in his Mom's kitchen working on making cliff bars. What a guy! I was at the point where I was trying to make my own granola bars, but after discovering these bars, I'm hooked. They are portable, delicious and basically, I love all the flavors. You can take them biking, hiking, walking, anywhere. This bar is especially delicious and I seem to fall in love with it again each October. Must be the spices and the creamy white chocolate chips. There are just enough chocolate chips to remind you of cream cheese icing. If I had to choose between a piece of carrot cake and one of these bars, the bar would win. Also look for the Cranberry Apple Cherry Bars and the Pumpkin Spice Bars. ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
About what you would expect, Clif Bars are awesome. I wish there was more variety in the box, and I didn't like the Oatmeal Raisin Walnut bar. It tasted very mineral-y 
This was a perfect fit for my healthy lifestyle! What I found also very helpful was getyoursexyon.myarbonne.com it was the only thing that I never thought would be missing from trying to be healthy everyday. Guess there's enough people vouching for my all time fav cliff bars so I wanted to spread the word, I know I wish I would have found out sooner! 
If you burn lots of calories in your activities, this high energy food could give you a lift. There are 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar, which is advertised to be at least 70% organic. This bar is advertised to be for athletes first, and as a casual snack second. If you are overweight and trying to drop pounds, you can skip this snack and move back to unbuttered popcorn. When I opened this bar I noticed that it looks like compressed goop. However, the compressed goop tastes pretty good. The texture is much like a granola bar, though more moist than a granola bar. The black cherry part of the black cherry almond is understated. There are dried cherries in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor, which is a big plus. I was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial, which is an even bigger plus. One thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy, but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy. I guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some other process. In either case, vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product. The label also states that there may be traces of peanuts. This bar also contains 20% of the daily recommended dietary fiber, which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar. There are also lots of vitamins and trace elements, which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements, in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing. Clif Bars could be a casual snack, but the ingredients and their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high energy activities. If you fall into that category, which could include hiking, climbing, bicycling, running, jogging, and other similarly strenuous activities, then this bar could be a good way of packing a big punch in a small package. Enjoy! 
I was very careful to not press down as instructed when cleaning CDs, yet I was left with light circular scratches and smudges untouched. As for scratches, you may as well use toothpaste for all the good this will do you. The solution does not fill in even the lightest scratches. I tried it with several different scatches and discs and the result was the same. Multiple applications fared no better. The disc I bought this for primarily is in worse shape than when I started 
Based on the reviews of other, I decided to order this product as I had several DVDs with deep scratches. The product really works 
I was VERY iffy about buying a DVD cleaner/repair kit because I have heard stories of some products ruinning discs. However, one of my DVDs from a Gilmore Girls DVD set was scratched and it wouldn't play in certain parts of an episode. I tried on several occassions to clean it myself but it never worked. I was afraid that I would have to replaced the whole set because there are no "single" discs for sale. I did some research on DVD repair kits and I was going to buy a more expensive one but decided to go with the cheaper one (plus it had positive reviews) in case it didn't work, I wasn't out a lot of money. I am MORE than pleased with the Scotch DVD cleaner and repair kit, as I used it on my damaged disc and five minutes later, it was in PERFECT condition and played perfectly!!!! I am HAPPY beyond words because now I can clean and repair my DVDs without worrying about replacing them. This is defintely worth the $9.99 price tag, it does works and is worth it! If you are new to buying DVD cleaner/repair kits, try this one... as it worked for me, so it might work for you!! :) Very satisfied customer here. : 
I saw this a few days ago it The Source by Circuit City... definitley worth the money! It repairs scratches and saved all of the DVDs that I used it on. So there's no other repair kit... buy it today, If you see it 
This is the second one of these I've owned...my first one the screen went blank after about a month and a half...not an uncommon problem with this, I can see reading the other reviews...But I thought maybe it was just a problem with that particular pedometer, so I bought a second one...Big mistake! As far as the radio, what a piece of crap. I live about 20 minuters' drive from downtown Houston...maybe there are too many radio stations around here. It just won't lock on to anything, not even the strongest stations. Tons of static and stations fading in and out. I bought a pedometer with a radio because I wanted a radio while I walked. If you're selling a pedometer with a radio, the radio should work. I would give this 0 stars if I could 
I actually bought this book based on all of the negative reviews that it did not have enough "fill in the blanks." I wanted a baby book that would give me a topic and let me journal about it without too much prompting. There are a few fill-in pages (see below), but for the most part I can write my feelings and thoughts about my baby in my own words. This seems like a much more personal approach, and one I think my son will appreciate more when he is old enough to read it, than fill in the blank pages. A previous reviewer complained that the pages are thin and newspaper-like. True, they are simple white pages with black titles, but the pages themselves are not at all flimsy--thicker than the average novel page and more like lightweight cardstock. The illustrations are small, simple, and non-intrusive. Black and white line drawings that are more iconic than a cutesy. My only complaint about this baby book is that I would like more topics (birth story, tooth chart, food, favorite expressions, favorite toys/games. . .) However, the pages look like they are about 11" x 8.5" and it is bound with ribbon, so I think with a little creativity, cardstock and a hole punch I may be able to add my own pages.

The product it's exelent but You didn't ship yet my item, so I'm waitting for it........the delivery service it's to bad. Please notify me if you going to delivery it or if it's better no to wait for it 
I really liked the outside design of the book. A lot of books were "cartoonish" and really was drawn to the look of the book. I wish the book did not have so much random fill-in pages. I had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events/ages of the child. But all in all I am pleased with it. I would most likely buy again 
This book is very nice and all but there is only one page each for the 1st . 2nd , and 3rd birthday and there are no lines to right on in the book only on some pages. So this book wasnt worth what i payed for it 
This baby book is awesome! It is very beautiful. It is very different from the traditional baby books and more like a scrapbook. It is not a big questionare book like the others. For example there are headers at the top of the pages (i.e. All About Mom or Parties Showers) and you fill in the page anyway you'd like 
I have an incandescent floor lamp and the Clapper works great with it. OTOH, another lamp is fitted with fluorescent bulbs, and the Clapper doesn't work at all. I called the manufacturer and only then was told that the Clapper will not work with a fluorescent fixture. Nowhere is that mentioned. Beware 
I loved the idea of the Clapper. I live alone so the clapping sound wouldn't bother me and I looked forward to the convenience factor. My first Clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working, but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short. Did I learn my lesson? Oh, no! I went ahead and purchased another Clapper some months later. The night before last, the lamp I connected this one to started blinking. I checked the lightbulb and it was OK. It was only went I got down close to the Clapper plugged into the outlet that I heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity. Once again the Clapper crapped out, this time in a different lamp, different outlet. Will I never learn? Thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device. Can you say "housefire"? Again, how dumb am I? Is the unit UL-approved and, if so, have any other complaints been lodged about it? How does one find this out? I like my gadgets, but "buyer beware" on this one 
kept the sensitivity switch set for home, plugged it in and it works. have had it almost a week and it hasn't gone off unintentionally yet. two claps with a slight pause between works perfectly to turn it on and off. works just fine for the price 
I just got this and loved it. Noise from my TV didnt set the lights off neither did shouting at my relatives. there needs to be a pause between the sound so it doesnt really get set off unless you time yourself clapping. It's great especially for me because i have a light that you plug in on the other side of my room so it was a pain to turn on the lights at night when there was complete darkness 
you know how it works. i read a lot of reviews saying it detects any noise. i have mine in my bedroom on the medium setting and the really the only thing that sets it off accidentally is the vacuum cleaner. im sure if you put it near a door or in a very noisy room your results will vary 
I just purchased the 40 oz. size. The cap fits well and seals well. The company told me that all the different sizes use the same cap now, so there is no fit problem. The bottle is well finished and strong. Easy to drink from. It is wonderful to be using stainless steel now, and no longer be using Nalgene, which is polycarbonate plastic, and a possible health hazard (bisphenol A) 
I have found Rayovac Alkaline Cells Last about 10% longer and have a slighty higher Starting Voltage than Most Akaline Cells 
I HAVE BEEN USING PAMPERS SINCE DAY 1 WITH SWADDLES IN THE HOSPITAL TO PAMPERES CRUISERS NOW.THEY ARE THE BEST AROUND.NO LEAKS EVER NO RASH 
This is one of the few diapers that has never leaked! Love that aspect.... 
The product is excellent, the Cadillac of diapers. It arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition 
very soft and strong diaper. my bb loves it. hold quite a bit, no leak for over 12 hrs at nite. I used it on my bb since 3.5 months and now he is 7 months old. 
Cruisers provide a good fit with almost no leaking. They're comfy on our little guy. We have tried other brands and prefer this one 
I think pampers fit well on the ever-moving body of crawling babies! They are absorbent and leak proof. These are a good fit and a good price 
my baby is 12 moth now and she uses the Pampers Cruisers (size 3) from 4-month-old. it is soft and my baby never have "rush" with it. my whole family love this diapers. 
I used to love Huggies Supreme diapers- until they switched them to this GentleCare or NaturalFit with HugFlex... and honestly they are terrible. The plain "old" Supreme diapers were the best, and now I can't even get them at any store in town anymore. SO I switched to Pampers Baby Dry, which are about 20 cents per pack cheaper than Pampers Cruisers. Those were the most terrible diapers I have EVER tried. Nearing desperation level, I tried Cruisers, and I'm glad I did. They are almost as good as the old Huggies Supreme diapers. I love that I can get them with free shipping from Amazon - plus if you enter in the codes on the inside of the packs you can get free stuff from the Pampers website. Not bad 
I am glad to have this product. It works well and I do not need to use it often, save time. An absoulte epilator that is safer than just using the regular shaver because it cut my skin few times and scare marks on my skin and hair grows thicker. This product can minimize your hair grow and thinner as well. It works better than average for this price, great buy! 
I will not say this is the best epilator ever, but if you are ever in an emergency need for hair removal, and don't want to ruin your body with a razor, this item is good to have on hand. It's not a replacement for waxing but is a great substitute. Plus, if you feel like shaving is your only option, it does have an interchangeable shaver head as well. Basically it's your overall emergency feminine travel tool for beautiful smooth hair free skin. 
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS. I GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER FOR HER BIRTHDAY AND SHE LOVED IT. GREAT PRODUCT 
It's a very good product but it has some real problems... thinner hair is very difficult to remove, and over the knee hurts a lot!, the bikini and under arm head doesn't work very well. It's not what I was expecting but I am happy with it, it wasn't expensive and you can use it while you watch tv like I do 
My girlfriend was well-satisfied with this product even though the manual she received was not exactly for that model (ES2025V) and that is why I rated this item 4 stars 
I first tried the Hooah Bar about six years ago. They were purchased from Ebay and had been stolen from the army. After going through the ones I had, and unable to find them again, because of the second Gulf War. They were all shipped overseas! I use them for surfing, and they are better than any of the other power/energy bars, for sustained energy. But, what also places them well ahead of the rest is the fact that you can throw them in a vehicle during the hot summer, 100 degrees and leave them for a week. Open it and eat it. Try that with a PowerBar, and you have chocolate milk! 
These bars deliver on both the taste and energy. They chew better at warmer temperatures rather than colder temperatures 
These energy bars are different from any we have tired. We love the chocolate and the peannut butter. They really are great. Last weekend's golf tournament never would have been so easy in the Texas heat without a couple of these to give us the strength 
Bar tasts good and delivers an energy boost that lasts. Much much better than eating candy bars. Excellent buy and better for you than candy bars. I will continue to buy this product. 
I was offered one of these while cycling and thought it was very tasty. So good, in fact, that when I got home I went straight to the web site show on the back of the wrapper to learn where I could buy them. Just above the web address is the nutrition and ingredients list. That was probably a mistake on the manufacturer's part as it gives you something to read while the site comes up. OOPS! This bar has a whooping 25% of your daily allowance of saturated fat! Not only that, but the fat is palm oil. This might be acceptable for a soldier involved in prolonged strenuous activity but I doubt a cardiologist would recomend it to most of us. A commercially formulated product is more likely to fill the average person's need for a lower fat (and healthier fat) energy bar, than one formulated for extreme physical activity, sold for profit and marketed as a patriotic tribute to the troops. Bottom line: Read the label, weigh the health risks and if you want to support the troops, there has to be a better way than eating Hooah Bars. 
I love these because they're delicious and just the thing for getting me through a long workout. They're also perfect for traveling...easy to pack, and sustain you during an all day hike or touristy walkabout. A friend of mine in Iraq says he eats them twice a day, for the taste, and also because--and I agree--he trusts an energy product designed by the military for soldiers much more than an energy product designed by a private company for profit 
I really like these things. They're certainly chewy, so they can be a bit of a jaw workout, but they taste pretty good while having a lot more nutritional value than a candy bar, and they keep you going for a couple of hours. If only they were a little cheaper, say a dollar or less per bar, I'd probably go through them a lot more quickly than I do right now 
I have tested this scale against several others and none are nearly as accurate. I have moved this scale around the house and tested it on wood, tile, and carpet. It's always accurate to within .1 lbs, just as advertised 
definitely an eye catcher in the bathroom. Besides it needing a hard stomp to turn on when supposedly it needs a tap, it works great 
The scale indeed looks very nice and sleek with its glass design. The quality seems to be quite nice, and it's designed in England. There's a 10 year warranty in case anything goes wrong. The scale is very accurate, but I agree with others about the tapping issue. I have to more like "hit" it with my foot to get it started. Make sure you wait until the 18888 turns to 0 before stepping on. The 18888 means it's calibrating the scale to 0. You have to keep very still for the weight to stabilize. Or else it will just keep going up and down, although you'll be able to get your weight within the half pound before the number stabilizes 
Accurate, Accurate, and still accurate - that's it. I never got a scale accurate like this. And it's stylish, beautiful, and convenient. It worked for me immediately after I opened its box : 
This is a great scale and very accurate. I have no problem with this. I also had a difficulty to turn it on first, but after I read the manual, it was easy. It is very accurate and 9/10 gave the same weight with .1 pound (one was off by .2 pound) You need to tap it for making it vibrating. Don't just tap since it won't turn on, but if you tap it just like you softly hit it so the top glass vibrate, then it will be on. 
While I'm a big fan of Hooah bars, this particular flavor tastes like apple jolly ranchers. No kidding. If that's okay with you, then go for the apple flavor. I'd recommend the chocolate 
Bar tasts good and delivers an energy boost that lasts. Much much better than eating candy bars. Excellent buy and better for you than candy bars. I will continue to buy this product.

When I go out at nights I meet a lot of people. I like to be the centre of attention, which means I have to be louder and more fun than the DJ, the music, the flashing lights and everyone else in the places I go to. Its a lot of fun but drains my energy. I often find myself crashing half way through the night. I run out of steam, feeling hungry, dizzy and (worst of all) I loose my spark. The only thing to then is to leave and grab a bite to eat. Typically I feel bloated and sleepy then. So I'll often call it a night. The fun is over - which sucks! I needed a different way to do things. I experimented with candy bars, oatmeal bars and energy bars. None of them worked - they just delayed the crash a little. The Hooah bar was the last one I tried. I say it was the last one, because once I tried this I realised I didn't need anything else. I tried it out on my birthday. I have to admit the whole "developped by the military" thing made me curious. But after failing with all the other bars I didn't have high hopes. I took two bars with me that night. Around midnight the familiar signs that I had depleted my energy stores started showing: I felt a little dizzy, I got a few hot cold flushes, my stomach felt like it was going eat itself soon. The thing is I was having far too good a time to leave (I had a party of 7 people hanging on my every word - something which does tremendous things to boosting the old ego!) Instead of bailing - as I might have done, I just popped open the Hooah bar and ate it as I carried on. Within minutes my hunger pangs disappeared, my blood sugar levels balanced out and I felt back on form. The best thing is that I didn't feel bloated or tired afterwards. It was exactly what I needed. I know that I will be taking a Hooah bar with me every time I go out now 
I have been using HOOAH bars now after a workout before I play some sports and it helps me have enough energy to get through and perform as best as I can. I also eat it before a competition and I find myself having enough energy to constantly keep up with the other team. I highly recommend it. It is sweet though and somewhat addicting to eat like a candy bar 
Reading some of these comments, and after sampling a Hooah bar, I can understand why these bars give you long lasting energy. They're oily and sugary. Lots of sugar for quick energy and the oil stays on the stomach longer so you don't feel hungry quickly- that's why much of fast food is so popular, it tastes good and its satisfying, but it ain't necessarily good for you! The recipe makes it sweeter, and certainly oilier, than eating an ordinary candy bar. I think a Snickers tastes better. For those who are using these as meal replacement bars, I'd be real careful. The bar might be 'balanced' but it isn't a meal. Whatever energy bar you consume, they're good before a workout or post-workout for recovery but don't confuse them with a proper meal and all the components found there. As for me, I prefer an Odwalla bar or Cliff bar. Less grease, true natural ingredients, less hype 
I have tried several "energy bars" and have found Hooah to be the best at doing what it says it will do, give me steady energy. Most other energy bars that I have tried, pick me up and then knock me down a few hours later. I feel confident feeding them to my family too. My 8 year old son races motocross and eats one before each moto. My daughter eats one before cheering at football games and before her 4 hours of dance lessons. My husband, a contractor/builder, eats one before a hectic work day. I have to keep up with all of them and sometimes don't have time for breakfast or lunch, I just grab a Hooah bar and I am set. They are like bread and milk in our house, if we are out, everyone is mad at Mom. Since we have several friends and family members in the armed forces, we also like the fact that a portion of each sale goes to the military. Thanks Hooah! 
I encountered these at last week's Carlsbad Triathlon. They tasted really good and I figured if it's good enough for the military, I'll give it a try...sure enough, the military knows what it's doing--it seems to work as claimed. Thumbs up, or, Hooah 
Better-tasting than almost any candy bar, good for you - what's not to like? Best snack product for the serious chocoholic looking to rationalize his/her intake. Try it 
Out of the 3 flavors available, this one is the favorite of both my boys (4yrs and 7yrs). BUT no matter what flavor its a snack they both will eat and enjoy! 
While I am not sure what exactly these do taste like, I don't detect the peanut butter here. The texture is good, chewy enough, but the taste is...odd. Not at all sweet. I can't imagine any child (or adult) grown accustomed to high fructose corn syrup actually enjoying these. Bleh. If you want peanut butter, the Clif Bar has a much better flavor (and an even denser, chewier texture). If you want a Z-Bar, I slightly recommend the chocolate--although it too tastes a bit odd and is inferior to the chocolate Clif Bars. Builder Bars are also worth a try, sufficiently sweet and flavorful. Of course, with these alternative product lines you will get about twice the calories. Although I will not buy these again, I give the company a star for a worthy effort 
My son likes the taste and I like what's in it! This is a great snack to help school kids make it to lunch. Organic inputs, no hydrogenated fats and healthier sweetners make this a better choice for kids.

The Clif Bars were great- my only concern is that it seems like there was a lot more packaging then necessary for the product that was shipped. Thanks. 
If I had kids, I'd be stealing these out of their lunch bag. Cheeky bastards! I get afternoon chocolate cravings and can't scarf down Snickers bars everyday (at least not if I'm spending most of my day sedentary in an offic chair). The zBar Brownies offer all the satisfaction of chocolate with the wholesomeness of oatmeal. Ok, so it's not as rich and creamy as something from Hershey. But they are damn good without olestra, saccharine, and other ingredients that will embalm you. And the #1 ingredient is Organic Oats. The #2 ingredient is organic chocolate chips. If that wasn't a good enough start, all the other ingredients are organic too.  1 bar = 1 serving 120 calories 25 calories from fat 1g of saturated fat 0g trans fat 0mg cholesterol The biggest downside is 12g of sugar, but that's still doing better than most sweet snacks. I love these bars because they are tasty and filling. They are a "healthy" alternative to the tempations in your local vending machine. Cheers 
This was a present I send to my aunt *80+ years old, she can read much better now ! 
I finally found a product that works for me, after trying too many other products. I tried Magic Shave powder but couldn't use it no more than once a month (damn thing reeked, too). If I didn't get all the hairs, I'd be toast. I would have to use a razor for finish the job, which defeated the purpose of not getting ingrown hairs. I tried the Magic Shave creamer, and that didn't work either. I would get most of my beard, but if there's anything left over, I'd be in the same position having to use a razor to finish. I tried Norelco (received that for Christmas) but couldn't deal with my hairs being pulled (ouch!!). I bought a beard trimmer by Wahl to cut my beard to the skin, then used Magic Shave razor. It worked but still got razor bumps (not as bad) and sometimes bled. I was vacationing in Florida with my friends who visited his sister and brother-in-law. His brother-in-law happened to be the neighborhood barber, and he used this razor on my face. I got so enamored, went I got back I went online and bought it immediately. Since I know my face very well, I realized I can only use this shaver at the most twice a week. I used this since February of 2006, and it's been wonderful. I give it four stars because, even though it works like the product says, I do get a little bump here and there. All in all, I do recommend this product for men that suffers in-grown hairs. Please note, after reading other reviews, usage is individualized. In other words, know what your limits are in terms how many times you can use the shaver. You might be able to use it daily or weekly 
Suffering from razor bumps both on my head and face and due to the fact that I'm in the military, I can appreciate a razor that will limit the amount of bumps I get. The Remington ES-1000 does limit these bumps by shaving at the surface. Due to this fact, you might want to shave two times in the day; once in the morning and again during lunch. Since I'm in the military, this is necessary for me. The shaver in and of itself will not give you a "smooth like razor" look. You will need the assistance of an application like Williams Lectric Shave pre-shave splash to get that effect. Other than the frequent shaving, this shaver does limit the number of razor bumps you will get if not eradicate them all over a period of time. 
My beard hairs are extremely curly and I have struggled with ingrown hairs and razor bumps ever since junior high. I never liked the way I looked with a beard and I always wanted to be clean shaven, but my curly hair didn't allow me to shave more than once a week or so. If I shaved more often, the ingrowns and bumps would go out of control. As it was, only shaving once a week still gave me huge problems. I had resigned myself to always looking scruffy. Until I found this shaver. Instead of cutting the hair beneath the skin level (where it will cause bumps since it will curl and grown beneath the skin), this razor cuts the hairs just above the skin. What does this mean for me? For the first time in about 14 years, I am able to shave WHENEVER I WANT. My ingrowns have completely disappeared. I feel like a new person and I love looking clean-cut. Thank you Remington 
I bought this product because I had a borderline high reading at my doctor's office. Rather than having the hassle of going to his office and paying a cop-pay just to have it monitored, we purchased this unit. It works wonderful. Very simple and gives more information than I expected 
After using this product for about a month and a half, I began to get very high blood pressure readings (157/106). My doctor took my BP on the same day and got 130/80, which I also got with my manual cuff. I find that this machine tends to show a rapid pulse as well. The only good thing about it is that you don't have to record your readings manually. If they calibrate the machine properly, it would be a great thing, but I wasted my money 
Very good one. Bought for two months for everyday usage. Works like a charm. Better than my previous 20-dollars one. Would recommend to buy this 
It works very well. It seems pretty accurate. My wife has taken it to the doctor to compare with his monitor and it's very close. I recommend bringing it regularly to your doctor's appointments to insure accuracy. I don't think you could go wrong buying this product. We're very pleased with it 
Outstanding quality, consistency and accuracy! At the end of the day that is all you can ask from a blood pressure cuff (sphygmomanometer). A few things to bear in mind: In consecutive readings done at the same time, you will see a trend from higher to lower blood pressure as you "learn" to lower your own pressure. Also, your blood pressure at home will be lower than that you obtain at your doctor's office until you learn to overcome the anxiety normally associated with the doctor's office. This is normal and is one of the main reasons to obtain a home blood pressure monitor. Also, your pressure will fluctuate from day to day and even during a blood pressure monitoring session. So don't automatically assume that the gauge is not giving accurate readings! Trust me, it is. This monitor has been extensively tested against measurements obtained at the doctor's office and has been determined to be as accurate a method of determining blood pressure as you would obtain at the doctor's office - actually, more accurate since the anxiety factor is eliminated. So if you are looking for the best home blood monitor device on the market look no further. Just made sure and trust it! I heartily endorse this product 
Machine arrived promptly and was easy enough to use, even for a first time user. Price of this unit was MUCH better then the same unit at the pharmacy 
I bought this cuff on recommendation of my Md. My HMO tested it to be among the best. I've used this BP cuff almost 100 times now. It appears to be consistently reliable, and has been accurate when tested against standard cuff results. The ComFit Cuff is much easier to use than the previous "D" ring kind. The only negative I can say about it is that it is sensitive to any movement during use, and you need to use it with your arm positioned with elbow on a stable surface. Otherwise, it will give an "error" message. I am an RN, and I strongly recommend it. I also think it would be easy for most elderly adults to use. 
This is very easy to use and quite convenient. I'm not sure, however, how accurate this monitor is. It seems to record a higher reading than a manual one at times. The value of this home monitor is if the readings change dramatically. THen it's a warning to go to the doctor's 
I have been using this product for my electric razor for over 4 years. I find that it gives me a closer shave, and extends the life of my razor head and cutters 
I have tried nearly all brands of energy drinks. Hooah! are the best tasting and they give me the most energ 
Like another reviewer, I've experienced great stuff with this product. Let me tackle the beverage from two angles: 1) Taste. The stuff looks like lightly-green tinted water, but the flavor is a mild diet sweetness. Not like the raw high fructose surge of soad, but kind of a tangy tastiness that I personally enjoy. It's nice cold out of the can, though people have asked me if I was downing a Coors due to the silver exterior. 2) Energy. No caffeine, no guarana, no chemicals. Yes, sugar, but for some reason, no crash and burn. I just had my second one of the day about two hours ago (9:30PM) and I'm still feeling pretty good, considering I've been awake and working for 14 hours straight on. No coffee or other stimulants, so I'm crediting the drink. Hooah 
This energy drink is perfect for those late nights when you need a mental boost to get you through a few more hours of work. As a writer often under deadline pressure, I've relied on caffeinated products like Coke and Red Bull for years, but invariably they make me jittery and I have a hard time focusing. Not so with the Hooah drink...like a friend giving you a leg up onto something, it helps me make it through more work than I could on my own, and my brain doesn't feel all frazzled like the neurons are in the midst of an aimless firing frenzy when I drink it. My focus actually improves, which makes sense given that it was designed to keep soldiers alert through life or death situations 
I love this taste even better than the punch:tropical. It's so smooth, so light! U.S. Military scientists say it improves mental alertness up to 50%. I think they're right. Kudos U.S. Military! Being next to Camp Pendleton I love that this supports our troops 
I must say, this is the best energy drink that I have ever tried. My 8 year-old son races Motocross and drinks energy drinks on busy race days. He often has me take a sip of whichever one he is drinking. He loves to see my face crinkle up and laughs when I say, "How can you drink that stuff?" There was no funny face when I tried this one. This drink tastes like lemon water. It doesn't have that "thick syrup-y" texture that many others have and there is no bitter after taste. After tasting it, I read the label. No Caffeine, 45% of the daily value of vitamin C--Hooah. You can bet that these will be in my fridge next to the milk and OJ. I have finally found an Energy Drink that I can confidently pack in the motocross and cheerleading gear bags. My 5 year-old even likes it and feels like "a big girl" because she is permitted to drink "Motocross Soda". I am sure I will be breaking up many fights over who gets the last Hooah! Thanks Hooah!! 
I didn't received the model which I ordered. My order has been replaced twice, but it still didn't send the corrected one to me. Thank you 
I am very happy after gifting it to my mother in law. It has shown good results and its pretty accurate. We use it mostly with battery. Nice device over all 
This product works just great...the only thing that I don't like about it is that when I first opened it up, my daughter tried it out before setting the date/time feature and now I can't go back and correct the date/time. So, be sure to set it correctly before your FIRST USE!! 
This blood pressure monitor is accurate and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone 
I'm so glad I purchased this product! It's so easy to use and the memory is good for record keeping. I highly recommend this product to anyone that needs to keep track of their blood pressure. 
It is a good product. I bought it for my parents and so far they did not have any problem with error messages or inaccurate readings. However, one cannot measure the blood pressure on your own you need someone to help you put the cuff on your arm.I wish it was more easy for someone to do it by themselves and have it position well too. Overall a good product to buy 
Be sure to measure your arm before purchasing... it's annoying to receive the unit with the Standard Adult Arm Cuff (fits arms 9 to 13 inches around) and find out I have to order a larger arm cuff! Don't bother calling Omron "Customer Service" at 1-800-634-4350... just a typical big company voice mail hell! It even tells you to call another number to order the piece... My 1 Star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and Omrons "customer service 
I own a more expensive Braun but bought this model as a gift for someone who I wasn't sure if he would use an electic toothbrush. After 7 months, the toothbrush won't turn off-something is shorted out. Unfortunately I no longer have the receipt. My more expensive model which I use multiple times a day has been problem free for over five years 
I purchased this toothbrush in spite of the single semi-negative feedback and have been very pleased with its performance. I also received the "Hot Pink" model but since I generally don't brush my teeth with a lot of folks watching it doesn't present a problem for me-- at least not one that affects its ability to clean my teeth and remove plaque. For the price this is a fine product and I expect to get many years of use out of it 
This is a great drink. I wanted to try something that was different, and this definately fit in. It isnt carbonated, and tastes really good. What I really wanted to know though, was how it worked. There is no caffeine or taurine, and the ingredients list didnt really show anything out of the ordinary. It worked well though, and I was able to stay focused for a long time after drinking it 
I discovered the Hooah drink because my boss--a retired military man running for office--always has a case lying around. With campaign season heating up and workdays getting crazy long, these are invaluable...help us all stay on our feet when we have to and fend off that sluggish brain function that comes when you haven't slept a full night in eons

First tried HOOAH! bars at last Summer's Carlsbad Triathlon. Love the bars, had to try the drink. Taste delicious!: light, cheerful taste--nothing acrid--goes down smooth. They keep me mentally awake WITHOUT CAFFEINE OR TAURINE, way to go U.S. Military! Those military scientists know their stuff! HOOAH! (I love saying "HOOAH!") Love that this supports our troops, HOOAH! 
I saw these guys at the outdoor retailers show in SLC and tried there drink and bars. They are the best I have had. I was working 16-20 hours a day and tried redbull and othe products and felt great for an hour and then had to grab another. I tried these drinks and wow I was more alert and just awake not buzzing or anything. The next bext thing was the taste. It reminds me of the fruit punch you get at the fountain in the gas station. It tastes great. I cant wait til they get this stuff in the stores but for now I will order it here and let all my friends try it. This stuff is Great thanks HOOAH!! 
My doctor requires me to take an anemia test every week. Between the time it takes at the doctor's office, the high cost of gas, and missing work my quality of life was diminishing. My doctor mentioned that Biosafe has an FDA approved anemia test I can take in the privacy of my home. I purchased the test from amazon.com and the results were identical to my doctor's test! This test is perfect if you need a quick and simple blood test. Thanks Biosafe, you have truly made a difference 
These are a great, yuumy snack. For someone who counts calories (or points), it's nice to have an option that is relatively healthy and still tastes great! I have never met a Luna Bar I didn't like, though this is my favorite flavor 
These tasty bars have 100% of your RDA of 10 vitamins and minerals and at least 25% of 11 other vitamins and minerals. They are filling so make a great "breakfast bar" if you are in a hurry. They make a great snack for an adult or child who doesn't eat properly and/or forgets to take a daily vitamin. I have tried most of the flavors and have enjoyed them all 
The chai tea bars are my favorite. The coating on the top is a mix of creamy topping with cinnamon and ginger, but not overpowering. I used to be starving a couple hours after breakfast, hours before lunch....one of these at 10 o'clock sees me through even past my normal lunch time. It's packed with calcium and other goodness women (and men) need. If you're expecting some gooey mess you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for some tasty nutrition, this is it 
These bars are supposed to be for Women because they are lower cal and have more calcium. I think there are other factors as well. Men are usually affraid of products like vitamins for women stangely enough, but they say that they need calcium and protein too. I really like the key lime flavor it is great. I like lemon also and the chi tea. I like those flavors because they are light tasting and I do not always have to have chocolate the way some people do. The lime reminds me of the florida keys. These are really better than the original cliff bars and when they came out I did not eat another man ciff bar. I used to eat one of these for breakfast everyday with a soy milk when I had a busy life. Thankfully my life has slowed down now. It is good grab and go food 
After reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the Luna Bar flavors, I decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself. I noticed that the Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil. If you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor. The toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious, doesn't taste like a candy bar, and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages. Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market. 
The Cherry Covered Choccolate Luna Bars are quite tasty. Chances are, if you're eating a chocolate cherry nutrition bar, you need a little enticement to eat healthy. Like all these bars you do get sick of the same flavor day after day. I recommend alternating between these and another bar that's not so sweet (kashi trail mix bars are perfect). That helps me stick to the bars instead of hitting up the zillion calorie pastries at the corner coffee shop 
These bars taste delicious. It is fairly filling as a between-lunch-and-dinner snack, and for only 180 calories. Plus, it's almost like a multivitamin because it has a huge percentage (often 100%) of the daily recomended values of a lot of the vitamins you need! And 30% RDA of calcium! wow! !!! and again, they taste soooooo good. 
This monitor was easy to set up and use. It seems to be very consistant and accurate. BUT...it squeezes my arm quite a bit harder than any hand-pump wielding nurse or physician I ever met! It is rather uncomfortable. Has anyone else had this experience? Any comments? I've tried adjusting the cuff looser and tighter - doesn't seem to make a difference. The 'squeeze' is still uncomfortable. My arm tingles lightly for about 20 minutes after a test 
Great product, simple to use. For some reason, it didn't work for the first couple of times, even though the straps were in place as described. Had to start/stop couple of times before it started measuring, great product, good price, simple to use. This model does not come with an ADAPTOR and there is no information whatsoever about the type of adaptor needed. Would like to know the ratings but no information is available, the only option seems to be, buy an adaptor from Omron, which is very expensive. This product would not be used in US and I haven't yet been able to figure out whether it would support Worldwide Voltage 
This BP monitor is a Godsend for my Mom, who has arthritis in her hands and can't use the pump type machines. She is very happy with it. Very fast shipping and a great buy 
Well made, easy to use and seems accurate. A lot of value for the price. 
One lancet, three drops of blood.... it's as easy as that. The test results are accurate and prompt. What a wonderful test! 
The claim that the test requires only a couple of drops of blood is grossly inaccurate. In order to comply with the instructions at least a dozen drops of blood are required. I needed three finger sticks. The results were consistent with the laboratory results I get through my doctor and the results I used to get with the now-discontinued Choice A1C Home Test. I mailed the blood specimen on a Monday from New Jersey to Biosafe in Chicago and received the results the following Monday. Biosafe's privacy policy is very weak and their laboratory authorization form is intrusive. I declined to disclose my Social Security number and e-mail address. 
This is the best diet product ever! I tried them all and "SKINNY WATER?" is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever. The product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much. I drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away. I lost 15 lbs. in 20 days. Great taste, it works great, and it's so inexpensive. Great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight. The owners should hire me to do commercials for them 
I heard about this product through a friend and I was skeptical at first. I usually don't mind diet food or drinks that taste bad but the first taste of this I did not like it! To me it tasted like someone sprayed the inside of the bottle with Pledge and then put water in it. It may be a taste that you either like or don't like. I am one who does not like it, but I came up with the idea to add Crystal Lite (the To Go packs in Lemonade or Raspberry Lemonade are my favorite) and it is so good! it adds 5 calories but it is worth it! I still get hungary but i find myself getting full fast and not even finishing a meal. It may be in my head but if it works I dont mind! Also I buy mine at Target when I run out. 
I drink a lot of bottled water. It does NOT make me feel full - sometimes quite the opposite. Of course, drinking water before or during the meal lessens the chance of overeating, but the effect of the Skinny water goes beyond that. I love its taste because it is not overbearing and too sweet like other citrus-flavored water I've tried. It replaces my soda and curbes my apetite pretty well. I also bought a bottle for a friend of mine. He was wondering why he wasn't getting hungry for a long time, and only later realized it must have been the Skinny water. It costs quite a bit. However, bunch of drinks cost about the same and have negative impact on your body. So, even if this is a placebo effect (and, fankly, I don't care as long as it works), I think it's worth it. You'll have to judge for yourself. I can't afford three bottles a day, but will buy this water sporadically, most likely from my local 7-11. I would like to point out that most of the people who wrote negative reviews here either didn't like the TASTE of the water, or NEVER TASTED it in the first place. Of course some people don't like the taste - you can't please everybody - but it bears no relevance on its efectiveness! As for people who review stuff without trying it... well... they obviously don't understand what review means, and too bad their preconceptions count towards the overall score for the product 
This "water" was for a friend who like (and drink) it frequently. It must me good for her ... but it's hard to find in a nearby store. So I ordered it for her via Amazon.com ... waiting - waiting ... and finally one day before she left country (by plane) it arrived. At least she took 3 bottles with her .. 
I was very dissapointed with my purchase, as the citrus taste of the water was absolutely terrible and I just could not drink it, so there's a whole case sitting unused on my porch. Waste of money 
The Skinny Water had a light refreshing hint of lemon taste. It definitely curbed my appetite! Maybe too well, I actually had to remind myself to eat! I just made sure I drank 3 bottles through out the day and didn't necessarily follow the instructions about drinking before meals because I was on the road alot. I researched the the Super Citrimax and found scientific research to support the claim of increased fat burning. It was noted to alter carbohydrate metabolism with the effect of lowering insulin production. I drink bottled water anyway so it is nice to know I am getting an extra metabolic benefit. 
It's amazing the functions that you can get from this handy equipment 
I think this product is very good. Once you've glanced at the user's manual it's easy to use. You can store several profiles in it so that every member of your family can quickly use it. The only thing I wish it would do that it doesn't is save previous results. This is a very handy tool for keeping track of your weight loss progress. You'll have an idea of how your body composition is chaning along with your weight 
I bougth some Omron's for my colleagues. I is a high quality product. The results may change, as a result of water changes in your body and your handling, so the results are not perfect but it works good as a general reference to know if you or your client is in its ideal weight, overweight, etc. I recomend this product to doctors, nutritionist and Herbalife Distributors ! 
For the payed money it's ok. It's easy to use. One thing that could make this gadget better is an interface with a computer, in order to record each reading and analize the progress time by time 
I've found the Omron very easy and practical to use. It gives very good estimates of body fat percentages and BMI (body mass index) which can easily be used to illustrate a personal rate of progress for any dietary or weight training program. For the money, it would be difficult to find something better 
This is a well-made device of useful, though limited, value. It's usefulness derives from its consistency, which is amazing. Given that your body composition varies throughout the day, particularly your level of hydration, the Omron measurements vary by only fractions of a percent - exactly what you would expect. It measures small electric currents running from one electrode, through your body, to the second electrode. The Omron is programmed to estimate your body fat by measuring the impedance of your body to the flow of electricity. So, one might think that such a measurement would be straightforward, like on a weight scale. Electricity encounters fat, muscle, bone, and fluids and the Omron interprets the current and displays your body fat percent. Right? After all, when you step on a scale, the scale responds by showing your weight. You don't need to tell the scale whether you think you are an athlete or how old you are. It simply measures your weight. Well, the Omron doesn't work that way, nor do other similar devices, nor do skin-fold calipers. It looks to me as though electrical and skin-fold devices all simply measure surface body fat. Then they require that you input other data, such as your activity level ("normal" or "athlete" in the Omron case) and age. This is not good because it introduces general population averages into what should be specific measurements of YOU. For instance, regardless of your body, it is assumed that the older you are, the more internal fat you have. The resulting body fat estimates are dramatically different when factoring in those variables. The Omron (and calipers) is still useful, though, if you consider it to be a compass rather than a scale. You can't be sure that it can tell you where you are, but, over time, it can tell you where you are going. 
I love this product. It appears to be accurate to any other body fat analysis I have had, and it is quick and easy to use! Really has been helping me see my progress beyond the scale! I would recommend it 
I find the Omron hbf-306 body fat analyzer fairly simple to use and pretty accurate overall.... 
I've been using the Omron HBF-306 Body Fat Analyzer for a month or so now. So far I've been very impressed with its consistency. However, I would have to go to a doctor and get some sort of analysis and compare that with the Omron's measurements to see how accurate it is. It's well built and very easy to use. Once you set up your profile, it only takes a few seconds to get a read. I would give it 5 stars but again I dont yet have anything to compare its measurements with. Still a good product at a good price. 
This body fat analyzer is user friendly and comes with a comprehensive guide on interpreting your body fat and BMI readings. The guide also discusses nutrition and exercise. I have been very happy with my purchase 
My sister in Israel bought this pedometer and highly recommended it for me. She had gone through several pedometers and found this one to be exceptionally accurate and liked the features that it had to offer. Since I had purchased others from stores and was unhappy with their performances, I thought I'd give this one a try. I love it. In fact, I bought two more for my children, and have recommended to others. About 15 more of these pedomenters have been purchased due to my sister's and my response. My colleagues and I find ourselves almost competing on the steps...we're taking steps toward becoming healthier. This is certainly money well spent 
We purchased 2 of them and are very pleased with the size of them and really like the 2 option clips. Very easy to set up and use. Really like the memory feature of being able to see the last 7 days. Would recommend for anyone wanting to know how much they walk in a day and/or to use during your walking workout 
I bought this gadget with the intent of monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where I was currently to establish some sort of baseline so that I could get a reality check on my activity levels. I opened the box, read the easy directions, set up my personal step measurement (just measure off the distance of your 10 steps), and clipped it on my pants and forgot about it for the day. I was surprised to find out that a corpse could probably move around more during the day than me! Over the next 6 days, (this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of steps for you); I literally stepped up my game and went from 756 steps with NO aerobic exercise on day 1, to 7,880 steps with 30 minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3! Every day has been getting easier to achieve the 10,000 "normal" steps, and increasing the aerobic steps too (which are tracked separately). I can press the mode button, check out how many miles my steps translate to, kilocalories burned, aerobic steps, and compare it with the past 7 days as well. It has turned out to be even more fun than what I originally bought it for. I actually feel better, and the fun part is that I am trying to beat my own personal record from the previous day! This has been an eye-opening experience for me, and I keep this on or in my pocket all the time now, just to make sure I keep a mindful eye on my steps and aerobic activity for the day 
pedometer is great! Easy to use, accurate. Highly recommend it 
I have used this for about a week and have found it to be very accurate. I like the various readouts that it has and the quality appears to be excellent. It is very easy to set up and use. So far, I have found no fault with it 
This pedometer is about as accurate as you could reasonably expect. The features are suitable and it even looks good. The only problem I have with this product is minor, and it's why I gave the item 4 stars, rather than 5. The plastic holder/belt clip that comes with the pedometer is cheaply made and has a very puny little spring. If you don't plan on using the belt clip, this is definitely a 5 star item. Otherwise, just treat the holder gently and hopefully it will last longer than mine did, because Omron won't sell the holder seperately. The holder is the only weakness to speak of and if Omron redesigns it, this will be 5 stars across the board (For the record,I wouldn't let my opinion of the holder stop me from buying another one. I'd make the same suggestion to anyone who's on the fence - buy it. 
This pedometer works excellent! After only having it for a few months, it acidentally got put in the washer and to my amazement, after letting it dry out, it worked just as good as before! I highly recommend this product 
It does exactly what it is meant to (rare in these days of overcomplication) and is easy to set up. It even comes with a screwdriver needed to change the batteries (also supplied) 
This is an excellent pedometer, also I noticed that Oprah featured it on one of her weight loss shows. This pedometer keeps track of distance, calories, aerobic steps (walking continuously for 10 minutes), and regular steps. I like it most because it has belt clip and a clasp clip; I lost my last pedometer because it didn't have a clasp clip. This is an excellent buy 
The Body Journal allows you to store important health information for the whole family. I found it particularly useful for tracking my children's weight, height, vaccination records, and general health. While some of this information was recorded in baby books, much after their first birthday was only written on small pieces of paper that were inevitably lost. Using the journal for recording the information was easy and gave me peace of mind that I hadn't lost any information. I can see how The Body Journal would be particularly critical when trying to monitor a specific medical condition. It is reassuring to know that in the event of an emergency, the health records of my entire family and all their doctor's information are available instantly 
As the mother of two children, one with special needs this product is a must have. It allows me to easily keep track of all medical events. It is particularly useful when visiting a doctor for the first time as I can easily provide a summary of my child's medical history. No more guessing! When my children are grown they will have a record of their medical history. This is particulary useful for a child with a complex medical history. It's a very user friendly tool. I highly recommend this product. 
I've been using a $120. dollar Phillips/Norelco shaver for about a year and I changed the rotary blades once. My skin was becoming irritated to the point of, hell with shaving I think I will grow a beard. Well to make a long story short I was told by my wife and son that I looked about 10 years older. That was all it took to push me to look for a better shaver. The Braun 360 Complete is like night and day comparing it with rotary shavers. It shaves alot closer in half the time! Plus it cleans itself and tells you (by the LCD)at what time you should put new foils and cutters, ( about 18 months). Absolutely tears up rotary shavers 
This is the fourth Braun shaver I have owned, and this is clearly the best. Yes, it is a bit expensive, but you use it everyday and my last shaver from Braun lasted over six years and survived year long deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq in 130 degree temperatures. This shaver is the quietest I've used and cuts my beard in less than three minutes. The cleaning system is much better than the last system and the shaver always stays fresh and clean. I am not sure the message display is necessary, but it does tell you how long it took to shave each time and tells you how much battery charge is left. The 8975 model is probably just as good as the top of the line 8995 model, but I liked the idea of the larger message center and knowing how much of a charge is left. The Gillette blade is very nice and cuts through my thick beard like butter. I am very satisfied with this shaver and will purchase other Braun shavers in the future 
This shaver has met all my expectations. It cleans and recharges itself automatically. The shave is close and nick free. The only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes 
My husband said it is a very good shaver. It took a few days to get used to the shaving head because he has always used the Norelco shavers with three rotating heads. The Braun is a closer shave. The cleaning system works very well and it is easy to handle 
The best shave I've ever had, but not perfect. Even though my face feels smooth afterward, it still shows some shadow. I'm not sure if any shaver can completely remove my tough beard. The Braun does an excellent job especially on my neck, which I have never been able to shave to my satisfaction. The unit is powerful so time spent per shave is short. The cleaning system is superb and doesn't involve too frequent fluid changes. The refills are inexpensive anyway. I don't regret the purchase. Too bad the cleaning system is not easily portable 
Newest Braun just got better. Been using them for years and will continue 
This product really works. I had a dry and scratchy throat and tried this and was impressed with how fast the symptoms went away. I now carry this with me at all times. I highly recomend. With the cold and flu season soon upon us, I suggest everyone have some Simply Gargle close by. Fast effective relief from sore throat! Thanks again! 
I had never heard of this stuff before, but I decided to order some anyhow due to the single serve packages and me constantly being on the run. I am now a HUGE fan of the product. It works incredibly well and the convenience is a life saver for gargle. I am not sure why nobody has thought of this before. It tastes great as well. I must say...it is hard to find in stores, but I will jsut keep buying from Amazon as needed since they generally have pretty low prices on this type of product. Love to naturals!! 
Was up late at night with a persistant sore throat. Found this item and ordered online. I was able to use it at work the next day about 5 times and it was great. It felt as if my grandmother was in the kitchen stirring up a gargle mix with salt and water. I guess the added herbs in the formula worked 
This bar tastes pretty close to a dessert bar. I would buy it again 
Accurate and simple to use. I received my results in the mail in less than a week and the results matched my doctor's results! Highly recommend this test 
Very convenient for at home testing for those who wish to track their results on a more frequent schedule than their doctor's visits. Instructions are easy to follow and results are sent in a timely manner. The company also can build a profile so buyers can see their results over an extended time period 
The best thing I can say about the test is it took 13 days to receive my results. The actual results varied greatly from those I received from my doctor 3 months prior: (...) Both tests were taken following a 12-hour fast. All instructions were followed. I find it hard to believe my cholesterol levels changed so drastically in 3 months. I contacted BioSafe customer service. All representatives were busy on my first call so I left a message, which was not returned. I called again and was able to speak to someone right away. The customer service person was very pleasant and took a lot of time explaining how accurate their tests were and how results from different testing methods (finger prick vs. blood drawn from arm) will vary "slightly". (...) I question the accuracy of the biosafe results.  
Only works properly if you are not moving AND in a zero-gravity environment 
I love this thing. You do have to stop exercising to take your pulse, but I use it mostly for biofeedback. It is so great to use when I'm having a panic attack and cannot keep count myself. What I love most is that it's not expensive, but you don't have to wear any sort of strap around you!! And you can wear it just like anyother watch 
I have owned this pulse meter for approximately 2 weeks and I find it to be accurate, but it takes a while for it to give a reading. The first few times I used it, it took over a minute to tell me my pulse. However, the manual does state that when you become used to the correct positioning of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster. So far, this is true, as within the last 3 days, I have received readings within 10 seconds consistently. Considering the price, it was a good purchase 
I have practiced deep breathing relaxtion techniques for many years, and thought that I was able to control my heart rate and blood pressure. My last visit to my Dr told me otherwise. Even after deep breathing exercises my diastolic was still a little high. After using WD for a few days I realized that my deep breathing techniques that I had been practicing was all wrong. With Wds help I am able to truly relax to lower my stress and BP. If you buy this and treat it like you would a regular computer game with the same expectations of achievement in getting to the next level, you will be very disappointed. However, if you use WD as a way to achieve true relaxation quicker than you thought was possible, then you will love it just as I do. By using WD I am able to relax quicker with every use. I finished the game in two weeks, but still revisit the relaxation exercises almost every night. Just ordered the next installment "Wisdom Quest", and can't wait to learn new techniques. If you buy the Journey to the Wild Divine, give it an honest trial and I am sure that you will not be disappointed 
If you are trying to learn relaxation through biofeedback, this is the product to buy. Packaging, support, presentation, and hardware/software quality are the best that I have seen. No down side. It's not a game in the usual sense. More of a way to learn techniques in a quiet and amusing way. There is room for a little mischief. Instead of allowing the balloons to flow smoothly, I tried busting a few. Type A personality shows through occasionally. I will be purchasing the next item in the series. I am learning to relax, at will, which will be helpful in my high-stress occupation. Good luck 
I have had so much fun learning Bio feedback and learnig to breath. The exercises and the story line are really helpful to achive control and develope skills for meditation. I highly recommned this product. I will be purchasing the add-on in the near future 
I was skeptical of this program at first, but had a chance to demo it for several days at a conference. It's compelling and fun to use. It's also accurate-- at one point I was focusing on relaxing and allowing some balloons to float slowly across the bottom of the screen. Someone came up behind me and startled me and the balloons jumped up to the top of the screen in time with my reaction. My only complaint is that parts of it are a little slow and talky. It's well worth the expense if you're interested in developing your mind/body communication, although probably not as valuable for someone who is already well into that 
Just to warn you, if you have never meditated before with a biofeedback machine you are in for a surprise. My first few times meditating(before I purchased this game) were great...but then, it became harder and harder to achieve the original calm after that, not only that, it took longer and longer to achieve even the slightest amount of relaxation. Then out of desperation, because my anxiety and self-consciousness were once again running and ruining my life, I bought this game. Now I am always relaxed and I can reach calm in minutes and stay focused for hours throughtout the day. It is amazing how the biofeedback, music and interest in trying to play the game can be so effective...again you will be amazed. However, I did struggle the first few times trying to get into a groove, but once you hit that groove it stays around and is easy to obtain. I would say that it probably took me about 2 hours to hit my first state of calmness. That sounds like a long time and it is, but the game and the biofeedback make the time pass. The second time playing I was already calm and moved through the game rather quickly. The third time and beyond I am able to succeed at the challenges pretty quickly compared to the first time. I am always calm now..which is a wierd experience for me..and always feel focused. Even little babies and animals come up to me now...just kidding.  For type A personalities I would just read the comments and lower your expectations for how fast you should succeed at this game. You will definitely need patience, but once you are calm..the pace of the game is just perfect. The frustration and patience will be worth it. Meditation is so such a simple process that it leaves with the impression that it can be obtained instantly...o' contrare, meditation requires mucho patience...and if you read this far in my comment you probably have the patience to succeed,and again, it is worth it 
I was very pleased with the test. It came quickly and the instructions were clear and simple. Once I sent it in to Biosafe Laboratory the results came back within a couple of weeks. 
This is actually a great shaver. I like the three settings of length. And so far it is doing a great job. I recommend this product 
The foil is a bit misleading, because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves (under the zipper) the timmer will catch you and it hurts, a lot. The foil can ONLY be used on straight surfaces. The two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle. If you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer.... well, be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa 
Very happy except a travel case would be nice. Too many loose parts otherwise. Have not tried using it in wet conditions 
The bodygroom is excellent. I used to trim my chest with Wahl trimmer. Compared to the Whal, the Bodygroom is weightless, way easier to reach all over your body, no fear of using in the shower (waterproof and cordless) for faster disposing of hair, easier to clean in the shower after done and easier to store, just hang it dry right next to the shower. It will make you go hmmm 
The bodygroom lives up to the manufacturers promo. It does every thing norelco says that it will do with ease. The first it i received had a problem. I contacted norelco and it was replaced with out a proble 
I was a little skeptical when I first bought the Bodygroom, but I have to say that it was definitely worth the money. The first time I used it, it was extremely comfortable and easy, and the areas I shaved ended up being almost as smooth as if I had used a razor. It's easy to clean and recharges quickly. The only drawback is that it doesn't work as well after you've used it for a while. I'm not sure if it's because the blades dull quickly or if it's just normal wear and tear, but you just have to be a little more careful because it's easier to nick yourself when it's worn a little. Overall, however, the Bodygroom is a great tool for trimming and keeping the groin, chest, and underarm areas smooth 
The product does what it should do. I did find that it was a good idea to take my time when trimming sensitive areas. Move too quick and it pulls a little. Other then that I haven't had any issues 
At first I was kind of skeptical... I've used many razors both electric and none electric.... but NOTHING compares to just how awesome this works. I was done in no time! No nicks, no bumps, no stubble... worked better than great! It works exceptionally well on the "certain skin sack" without pulling or cutting. WORTH IT 
Philips sent me a reprogram plug-in that took me only 10 minutes to change the settings to meet the new standards. Most of the low price AED's use camaera batteries. My defibrillator has a long life lithium battary. I won't risk someone's life on store-bought battaries. Walt Blankenshi 
As an ER/Trauma nurse I have seen and been involved in many, many cardiac arrests. Here is some information that you need to know 1) You must still perform adequate CPR, if not brain death occurs within 4 minutes of oxygen deprivation to the brain! 2) Even with trained personnel, CPR, a defibrillator and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (medications) the survival rate is very, very low. I am not telling you this to discourage purchasing this AED it is a wonderful unit I have been trained on it and had to use it once. I am letting you know that if you are willing to spend over $1000 on a defibrillator (especially for a private home)then a good idea would be to spend another $50 and take a basic CPR class. I hope that no one that buys this ever has to use it!! 
Very compact with good instructions. Comes with a very durable case and handle which makes it easily portable. I hope I never have to use it 
Very easy to understand. The talking feature works very well. We left ours in a cold car that was below the recommended temperature. The defib. voice instructed us how to get it functional again. We are very pleased with the ease of operation 
Contrary to what John Stevenson said in his review, you cannot administer a shock to someone who does not need it. The device has a built-in monitoring function that only allows you to shock when it detects the inproper heart function 
God willing, I won't ever have to. When I do need to use it, I hope it is easy. If it's too hard, the consequences could be dire 
At church today I came upon a man who had partially collapsed. Since I'm a physician, I stopped and offered aid. It turns out that he had a history of heart disease and was having some pretty concerning symptoms. To my dismay, we do not have an AED at our church (yet). We notified 911, and he was taken for medical care without any problems, but I was a bit worried there for a few minutes. While I'm trained in BLS, that is, at best, a temporizing measure. AEDs have a proven ability to diagnose and treat fatal heart rhythms. In my opinion, places of public gathering should consider purchasing one of these devices. I'll be working with our church to see if we can get one. I would have been a bit more relaxed waiting for EMS if I had had one of these today. However, buying an AED is not a cure-all. I have been trained on these, and they are very simple to learn to use. However, I think it would be quite difficult for someone who had never used one use it correctly during the stress of a cardiac arrest. If you are considering buying an AED for home or public use, I strongly suggest reading the section on AEDs at the American Heart Association website. It discusses some of the important preparations to consider before the purchase of such a device. So, while not for everyone, this is one of the few products available that can truly save lives. In the right situation, it is indispensable. 
I was employed by a major airline as a flight attendant. Our company was one of the first to madate AED's onboard. Because of my experience, I would recommend this product, but ONLY if you are in a risk group. The key to survivablility of a cardiac arrest is the response time to medical treatment. An AED can close the gap between the incident and the arrival of professional medical assistance. Minutes of delay can mean death or brain damage. This was my experience with an AED. A passenger suffered what appeared to be a cardiac arrest. There were no professional medical personnel onboard other than the well trained flight crew. For those that think that flight attendants are onboard to serve coctails and peanuts, think again. The beauty of the AED is the precision method of monitoring the patient's vital signs, then advising proper steps. This helps to alleviate human error in administering first aid. After assessing the vital signs of the patient manually, we hooked him up to the AED. The system advised a shock. One was administered, which restored some heart rhythm. We were able to continue artificial respiration until the aircraft landed and medical personnel arrived. The passenger, while he did not regain consciousness onboard, did recover from his cardiac arrest. The timeframe of surviving a cardiac arrest is measured in just a few minutes. The AED offers a helping hand in a crucial situation. If you are in a risk group, I'd recommend this product. 
As an Emergency Nurse Practitioner and Paramedic, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of getting electricity to an adult who is suffering from cardiac arrest. Technology is moving quickly to get electricity to the cardiac arrest victim earlier and earlier -- and the survival rates AND quality of life rates after such an arrest are sky rocketing accordingly. Is there too much direct-to-consumer marketing by medical-related companies? Probably. Is your personal risk for experiencing sudden cardiac arrest per calendar year low? Definitely. ...but do those smug reviewers refuse to buy vehicles with airbags in them just because their risk of being in an accident is low and the direct-to-consumer marketing is irritating to them? No! Those will be the same folks who want their cars with anti-lock breaks, airbags, the best side-impact reinforcements... and being a good driver (ie, "just improve your diet") won't cancel their risk for being in an accident. I hope you never have to use this machine, but as an emergency healthcare worker -- both pre-hospital and in the emergency room -- I cannot say enough positive about AED's in the community setting! Don't run out and purchase this out of paranoia, however if yuo are at risk for a sudden cardiac event consider if this would be appropriate for you, your family members, your apartment building, your church, etc. ...and rest assured that it is absolutely safe -- it is impossible to hurt a loved one with this, you can only help. ...and to those who gave negative reviews on this AED? Don't forget to pay your car insurance!.. 
These are the basic Flexisoft EB17 heads for adult users of any Braun Oral-B toothbrush (even the newer 3-D models). The blue bristles will fade and help indicate when replacement is in order (in case you don't see the bristles splaying out). Always have a pack around, nice for guests too. Prices vary, but about $5 per head in packs of 3, 4, 6 is a good value. These standard EB17s may be too firm for younger brushers. Search for the Extrasoft EB17 for your kids, they're essentially the same as those packaged with Disney or cartoon characters at a more reasonable price. (Do you need to pay $2-5 more for a picture Sleeping Beauty on the brush head?) 
I love the braun oral b toothbush for several reasons...A main one being the small heads on the brushes. While it may not be the one my dentist sells it is the one I use - with its small heads I am able to easily brush even the back areas... I always have a pack of these extra heads because you should change your brushes every few months and seeing the new ones in my closet makes me remember. I LOVE that they are color coded and the main unit can be used by many members of the same family. I find the brushes firm enough but not course...and my gums are not bothered by the heads at all. In fact they feel very good. I love this brush and having the replacement heads around is perfec 
I grew up seeing my grandma's dentures in a glass on the bathroom sink. So far, with the Oral B Power Toothbrush I have been able to avoid that fate. Anyone who wants to keep their teeth should use this product!! 
The toothbrush section an the local drug store has at least a hundred different tooth brushes on offer but in spite of all this variety almost all of these have large heads. If you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex, your teeth suffer. The Oral B head is small and although you have to work a little more on each tooth, you can. I have not had a cavity in years. My pearly whites look greate and my gums are firm an buffed. If only these woked on abs. 
Came within a few days. Cost was about $7.00 less then our local retail stores 
This is a great price compared to what's available in stores, although the product itself, like all brands of power toothbrush replacement heads, is ridiculously overpriced 
This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said "this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth" or some such statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet. The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing. Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth; it's kind of hard to deny it works. My dentist has confirmed this on direct examination. Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness. Enjoy life 
It is a Good and very handy test. Problem is the lancets and it takes 7 days minimum to get the Results. Lancets is a big problem though 
The TSH test kit was easy to use and the steps were easy to follow. I had problems with the needle device in that the prick to my finger was too small and I couldn't get even one drop of blood to come out. I called the number listed for help and they sent me a bigger needle in which I had no problems. The results came back within a week 
The product worked great, results were fast and accurate. I reccomend this product to anyone 
I definitely agree with the previous reviewers that this test is easy to use, self-contained, has very clear instructions, etc. I'll also add that the support is GREAT. They have a nurse practitioner there to take your questions if you have them and they have operators that help out with any other questions. I've had nothing but great experience with this test, and it's been helping me monitor my TSH levels as I come OFF of Synthroid through use of Acupuncture and Herbs. I highly recommend this product!! 
I use this test kit very often to monitor my TSH level. I report all findings to my doctor to keep her informed. I like not having to pay the high cost of traditional labs. The test kit is very easy to use and virtually pain free. The directions are precise and clear. They send your results with a graph so you can chart your progress with each test taking. All supplies needed are enclosed in kit, even the prepaid return envelope. All supplies are disposable and are designed to be a one time use only. No contamination concerns. Very recommended product. Great customer service dept. and knowledgeable staff of nurses available by phone if you need one. Make sure you follow the directions for ease of collection of blood.Very quick results that are easy to read 
This was easy to use and received test results in the mail 
These are a great, yuumy snack. For someone who counts calories (or points), it's nice to have an option that is relatively healthy and still tastes great! I have never met a Luna Bar I didn't like, though this is my favorite flavor 
These tasty bars have 100% of your RDA of 10 vitamins and minerals and at least 25% of 11 other vitamins and minerals. They are filling so make a great "breakfast bar" if you are in a hurry. They make a great snack for an adult or child who doesn't eat properly and/or forgets to take a daily vitamin. I have tried most of the flavors and have enjoyed them all 
The chai tea bars are my favorite. The coating on the top is a mix of creamy topping with cinnamon and ginger, but not overpowering. I used to be starving a couple hours after breakfast, hours before lunch....one of these at 10 o'clock sees me through even past my normal lunch time. It's packed with calcium and other goodness women (and men) need. If you're expecting some gooey mess you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for some tasty nutrition, this is it 
I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging "palm kernel oil" as an ingredient. Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!! No matter how many "organic" things are added to it. For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease. The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases. 
The Cherry Covered Choccolate Luna Bars are quite tasty. Chances are, if you're eating a chocolate cherry nutrition bar, you need a little enticement to eat healthy. Like all these bars you do get sick of the same flavor day after day. I recommend alternating between these and another bar that's not so sweet (kashi trail mix bars are perfect). That helps me stick to the bars instead of hitting up the zillion calorie pastries at the corner coffee shop 
These bars taste delicious. It is fairly filling as a between-lunch-and-dinner snack, and for only 180 calories. Plus, it's almost like a multivitamin because it has a huge percentage (often 100%) of the daily recomended values of a lot of the vitamins you need! And 30% RDA of calcium! wow! !!! and again, they taste soooooo good. 
These are very tasty. They take care of a sweet tooth without all the unpronouncable ingredients or being terrible for you. They also are great in a diaper bag, purse, center console of a car for when you get hungry and need something to tie you over until you are at home or whatever your destination 
I love this chair. I come home from work every night and sit for two cycles. It came before the delivery range had said it would be here. I had looked for some time, and had sat in them many times at Sharper Image, so I knew what I was getting 
I love my iJoy chair. It gives a better massage than anything else in the sub $1000 category. I figure even if it lasts me 1 year, $600 for about 300 massages isn't too bad. I can tell it is built really well, though, and I expect it to last a lot longer than 1 year. The preprogrammed routines are very useful for getting a general back massage. It also has the ability to concentrate on a specific area, which comes in handy as well. The chair comes in an enormous box, and is easy to put together...less than 30 minutes 
Love my iJoy chair... Just like the Commercial but Bigger!! Not a cheep vibration but actual rollers!! It even reclines back 
Buyer beware. Great chair for one year then the motor died. The warranty is one year so I am out of luck. If you think $600 is a good deal for one year's use of the chair then this is the chair for you 
The Omron MC 514 Thermometer works terrific. I am a nurse and the thermometer is very accurate. I use the thermometer at work, but will probably pick one up for home use as well. 
I bought this from Amazon and I don't like it - I need to take 5 or 7 measures to be sure about the values, The diferent from the firt measures to the 7 measure is 3 degrees, I have a baby 6 months old and for me is a problem to take a lot of measure. In conclusion IS TO BIG INACCURATE. 
I bought this from Amazon and I don't like it - the masured temperature drifts from 96.8F to 99.6F in 6 minutes. So inaccurate 
I have verified the accurracy of the Omron HEM-637 and found it to be very close to what my doctor said my blood pressure was. It is very easy to set up and use, The history feature is great, and my old eyes find the screen easy to see. I would purchase another one if I had to do this again 
Easy to use and fool proof to where to place monitor because of the beeping when placed at correct level with the heart. Check out the same as the doctors. 
I bought for my mom. I want to buy one for myself too. It's good for no medical background people 
The HEM-637 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with advanced poitioning sensor is VERY easy to use, accurate (I have checked it twice at Sams Club and Weis), consistent and the case it comes in makes it very portable to carry with me. I recently went off blood pressure medicine and was checking my pressure several times a day to ensure it didn't spike. Love, love, love it! 
I purchased this unit and was dissatisfied with comparisons I made at the doctor's office. I next purchased an Omron arm unit and found the results to be more valid and reliable. The wrist unit is very cool, but did not live up to Consumer Reports suggestion that it had acceptable validity. I'm technically savvy, an excellent instructions follower, and really wanted to like this unit, but I cannot recommend it. Skip the cool wrist unit and get an arm unit if at all possible. 
I find this to be an accurate and easy to use machine. I like the memory aspect of it. 
My husband uses this machine anywhere from 3 to 5 times a day. It is a lifesaver. 
After trying many brands of BP cuff, this is the first one that was truly accurate. I took it into my doctor's office to check it against the office readings, and they were right on! Unkike others that had been up to 30 points off! There is a great memory on it too---you can keep records of a month or more! Easy to use and set-up can be for either right or left wrist. Buy this one and don't bother looking further. You won't be disappointed 
We got this product five weeks back for my mother. Its not too intuitive, for my mother, as far as the 'intellisense' is concerned compared to the Omoron manual BP monitor we owned previously. But once you get a hang of it does its job fantastically. I would prefer manual BP monitor for older folks over the 'intellisense' 
At the doctors office I had a blood pressure reading on 12/05/05 of 148/82 and on 1/05/06 of 167/80. I started using Resperate on July 2006 at least 3 times a week. I have gotten as low as 125/75 but in the morning it can go to 160/88. I jog 3 miles everyday and use statins and a blood pressure lowering drug. I am 67 years old. Martin 
I've been using the RESPeRATE for a little over three weeks now, and I am starting to see some positive results! My blood pressure before using the RESPeRATE was around 150's/100's- now after three weeks of two a day sessions(once in the morning and once in the evening), my pressure is around 130's/70's. To tell the truth, I was having trouble at first with it, and was getting very discouraged, however, like the moderators on the RESPeRATE forum have continued to say, breathing easy and naturally is the key to sucess, something that I was not doing the first few times that I used the RESPeRATE. Now, I am actually enjoying using it, it really makes me feel calm and tranquil after my daily sessions. A Big "thumbs-up" for the RESPeRATE!!! Thanks, J 
I purchased this device for a friend that had very high blood pressure that was out of control. At the time (4 months ago) he was taking 4 different pills twice a day and while the pills helped in lowering the blood pressure it was still way above what it needed to be and the readings weren't consistant. After a month of usage his numbers started coming down, today 4 months after begining of usage he is down to half a pill a day, even his doctor who initially was a sceptic has become a beleiver and is recommending this to his patients. This device definetly works, I've read some of the negative reviews here and don't get it, its either they didn't use the device correctly as instructed or they are talking about another device completly. I have become an evangilist for this product and have one thing to say - If you have high blood pressure - GET THIS DEVICE, you won't be sorry, its a real way to get rid of all the medication you have been taking and a way to get your blood pressure down to where it should be naturally. 
A very useful device for synchronizing your breathing and heart beat, so as to lower your blod pressure without drugs. Anything that has few or, as in this case, no side-effects, other than to encourge you to relax, is very welcome. Very relaxing at the same time, so it is particularly good for those who don't find the time to relax during the day. Just 15 mintues a few times a week and you will find you almost want to use it every day. Would be even better if it could record multiple users instead of just the one person so it could be used by a family or in a clinic setting 
Simple to use, convenient and effective way to lower blood pressure has led to a reduction, by half dosage, of one of my prescriptions. Personnally tested myself by going off, resperate and returning to confirm lower pressure. Some people who have recently reviewed the product here, clearly have not used the device, or used it correctly 
Meditation will do the same thing. Buy a tape or take a class 
This is a plasic frenel lens. One side has grooves that if you look sidewise on, or edge-on, you will see a sawtooth curve radiating from the center. To create a 3X convex lens this size in glass would weigh a number of pounds. Wash with lots of soap, and air dry. Easy to scratch. This was invented for stage arc spotlights, due to exploding convex glass lenses. Audiences were showered in glass shards. Advantage--light weight, flat[may be carried in book being read], wont shatter 
I like it very much. I most use the aerobic and regular steps information only, but it is all that I need to help me tracking my performance thru the year. After 18 months of usage, all I needed to do was change the battery (after 12 months). I do recommend it 
I bought this a week ago and thought it was great. I was pretty proud to see how much movement I actually got in a day 16000 steps ... UNTIL ... I bothered to check to see if it was counting my steps accurately... I can not get it to take an accurate number. I adjust it and it either counts way too many ....100% error sometimes or stops counting and doesnt count at all... I am looking for another brand now.. 
It is GREAT to be able to QUANTIFY your "steps for the day" and check out other benefits. I like the way it is small and unobtrusive on the waistband. I like the week's worth of data. I like the way it clears itself at midnight and starts the new day. I found it hard/time-consuming to set the original parameters. Once it fell (into water) and I had to re-enter the data. Bummer. My walking friends now are interested in getting pedometers of their own. It is fun to have new ways of motivating yourself and others. 
Since i got this product, i never have to worry about logging in my steps. The memory works great, i only have to log in once for a week long exercise and i don't have to worry about resetting it everyday becasue it resets on its own in a 24H basis. A great resource a great friend!go get yourself one 
I have used this unit for about a month without any problems. It is a very good basic unit that will count steps, distance traveled, calories burned, and also counts what they call aerobic steps. If you walk for 10 minutes or more consecutively those are considered aerobic steps. It also has a memory of total steps for the last 7 days. The only problem I have had is forgetting to take it off. I ran it through the washing machine the other day and it is still working, so it is apparently pretty tough. All in all I would say if you need a basic pedometer you will be happy with this one. 
These pull ups are really small. It's like they put the wrong size in the box. My child leaked all over the place last night in bed. What a mess to wake up to??? Too small for the size that they claimed that they are. It looked more like a size 3. Would not recommend buying these tiny pull ups!!! 
This blood pressure monitor is easy to use and works great 
This Oregon Scientific Pedometer is very inaccurate and a waste of money even at the cheap price. There is no point to even considering "saving money" when it comes to pedometers if the count is going to be almost arbitrary 
A little difficult to calibrate correctly. The instructions are clear, but the machine doesn't seem to agree with my measurements, and so sometimes I get strange readings (30 paces, when I've walked 10 steps), etc... and no instructions given about how to troubleshoot this. I got it through experimentation, but I still get strange results... Maybe my pace is a LOT smaller than most people, but most of my readings say there should be about 2000 steps in a mile... my miles run about 3300... =/ Huh? Overall though, as a general guideline, it is sufficient 
IT WASN'T THE EXACT ONE I THOUGHT I ORDERED, WHEN I USE IT, IF IT'S AS GOOD OK 
I bought this pedometer for my Walking Club and they love it! They can count steps, miles and calories! It's easy to use and even setup specifically for ones weight and stride length 
This is good meter. We had to replace it after its sensitity switch went bonkers. We bought the same model. It worked every day for four years. I think it served us well 
At this price, we got pedometers for the whole family. My 9 year old son has worn his every day since. It is interesting to see how many steps you take in a day. We did not set the pace length as recommended, but other than that, it is ready to use immediately - just clip it onto your waistband. Shows steps, miles and calories burned. My only complaint is that the front cover is a little hard to flip open 
The monitor works really well. The functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking. If you are looking for a good basic monitor, this is a great unit. 
I have two Omron prroducts. the heart rate monitor and a blood pressure untit. Both have been very satisfactory products 
This is the perfect HRM for anyone just trying to monitor their heart rate. Directions for set up are very easy. The price for this HRM is pretty cheap compared to others. Comes in a great storage zipper bag. If you need something with more features like calorie counting, average heart rate, etc. then you need to looke elsewhere. Now that I can keep track of my target zone for weight loss I have lost 10 pounds in one month. Seems like I was not working hard enough. The alarms are really great and let you know if you are not working out hard enough or workin out too hard. I have purchased two already for myself and girlfriend and both work properly and they do not seem to obstruct with each other. Great buy for beginner or advanced 
HRM works great, much better than my Polar HRM(battery went dead right away). Unfortunately, the watch stopped working, display showed time but didn't change and none of buttons worked. Wasn't battery as power was needed to display the static time. Sent to Omron for repair. Things happen. When working it's great 
I use this monitor when I ride my bike which is daily at a local state park where I live. It works fine... the strap that goes around the chest isn't uncomfortable and its wireless. Another feature I like it comes with a rubber grommet so I can attach the watch to the bicycles handle bar... then its just a matter of looking down to keep track of the heart rate... overall... I would say for the price its a good value. 
This really works. You must put on a strap that functions as the transducer. It has a small radio transmitter in it that sends your heart rate to the wristwatch. Included is an adapter that allows you to mount the watch on your treadmill handle. I like it a lot. It works much better than the optical system that I had before. It often would not work if there was a lot of light in the room. You can easily adjust the strap. It doesn't have to be very tight to get a good reading. 
I don't know how this works because when I found that I would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work, I returned it. It isn't evident in the advert for this (or any other) heart-rate monitor. I guess I'll have to trust my sense of pain... 
Yipee. Thanks to amzn/UPS the replacement heads arrived just in time; especially since I had trouble finding this product locally 
What can you say about a toothbrush? If you own a Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush, you'll need these. This deal is a lot cheaper than buying the individual ones 
Although I'm happy with my purchase of these Oral replacements, I have to admit they do leave me feeling raw in my area when used for more than 5 minutes. While they're no match for the original, they still get the JOB done 
I have tried nearly all brands of energy bars. Hooah! are the best tasting and they give me the most energy 
I've tried a lot of energy bars and this is the best tasting. I am however partial to peanut butter. Cliff bars were my favorite, but these taste much better and that have a bit of crisp to them. The Cliff bar is dry tasting by comparison. I would have given this bar 5 stars had it not used palm oil. This ups the saturated fat, which I need to watch. Corn surup not the best thing to be ingesting either but since I am working out and burning it off its proabably not a problem. This bar has the lowest sat. fat (2g, 10%RDA) than their other two bars and the most potasium. The later is important to me because it may help ward off my leg cramps. I agree that the vitamins is probably a marketing ploy - after all, anyone who exersizes regularly probably takes a multivitamin. I'd give it 4-1/2 stars if I could. 
I love these because they're delicious and just the thing for getting me through a long workout. They're also perfect for traveling, easy to pack, and sustain you during an all day hike or touristy walkabout. A friend of mine in Iraq says he eats them twice a day, for the taste, and also because--and I agree--he trusts an energy product designed by the military for soldiers much more than an energy product designed by a private company for profit 
Again, I am a fan of the Hooah Bar, even more so now that I have finally been able to try the Peanut Butter Bar. At first taste, this bar reminded me of the candy that my "Pappy" used to share with me when I was a child. This bar tastes like a "Bit-O-Honey" or "Mary Jane." It tastes like a treat, but still gives me the energy and stamina that I need to make it through a busy day. I would highly recommend this member of the Hooah Family. Keep Up the Good Work, HOOAH 
A very fine product for a reasonable price. Full page magnifier assists those with visual problems to read with less eye strain. I am able to read smaller print books and articles I have been missing out on. A great help 
I bought this for a far-sighted relative, but it didn't magnify enough, and was distractinly blurry, so the gift wasn't well received. I give this two thumbs down 
This high powered toothbrush helps you brush better. However, it is not magic. You still have to know "how to brush." It is also much more messy, using this kind of toothbrush, but the dental hygenists strongly recommend them 
I have used this toothbrush for 2 months now, so while I cannot really comment on subjects like longevity or reliability, I can say that it functions perfectly. Firstly, it cleans teeth and gums SO much better than manual toothbrushes, or my one previous electric (Bausch and Lomb Interplak). An experiment that I tried that you can duplicate (if you have any interest): eat a "problem" food that usually leaves bits stuck between your teeth. For me, this means blueberries (the skins) or tuna. Brush with your manual brush. Then rinse and spit several times, until no more debris is coming out. Now floss throughly and then rinse and spit several times again. How much more debris do you get now? This is what your toothbrush did not get. Now try it again with the Oral B. With the Oral B brush, my mouth FEELS much cleaner, and I end up with much less food left for the floss to get. I chose the 7550 because I wanted the Oral B "3D Brushing Action" mechanism at the lowest price, and when I looked at the various models for sale, it seemed that the major difference between them (that was not just gimmicks) was the number and types of brush heads that were included with each model. I figured that since these were expendables, I would be buying more of them over the years anyway. In the end, the 7550 with the four brush heads that are included and 6 refills that I bought at the same time cost less than some of the fancier models with fewer heads. The build-quality seems first-rate, the action that combines oscillation with in-and-out pulsations is very effective, and my teeth are thanking me 
I know there are higher end power toothbrushes available , but for the price (~$40), I don't think this one can be beat. Much better than manual and the two minute timer is a great feature. Stand/charge is also very convenient. 
So far so good on this product. We'll see how long this one lasts 
I have been used electronic brush for over 3 years now. I am tired of changing batteries in my old electronic brushes once a few weeks. The Oral B 7550 sets its price at a acceptable range (I bought it when it was on sale), for about 35-50 dollars, I think they would be your number one choice. The decide is very decent, and everything works out quite well. With this set, you don't need to worry about changing batteries, just charnge it once a week would be fine (when the battery is in new condition), I am expecting it could last for about 3 years, so divide the price down to per year, it is really cheap. (I know that the brush heads still cost additional money) If you like using electronic brush like me, choose this product will be good to go. I am not a rich guy so I avoid buying those product cost like 50 to even more than 100. They do almost the same things, so why not just get the basic functions. As long as it can clean up your teeth, that is the most important function I am looking for 
This is a nice easy to use toothbrush. Lots of power and holds a charge pretty good. Best way to use is to let the battery drain down before recharging. After maybe five days of use, twice a day, you can feel the battery will need to be recharged for maximum power. I like the fact that it only has a two-minute timer and will NOT turn off after two minutes. I don't need a toothbrush with too many bells and whistles. Only annoying thing for some would be the blue recharge indicator light that stays on while charging. I use like a night light for those middle of the night bathroom excursions. No more being blinded by turning on the light 
This toothbrush really gets the job done. The feeling of your teeth being so clean is really incredible and pleasant. I find myself licking my teeth all morning, and I can't wait to get home at night to brush them again before bed. Awesome! As I have learned over the course of my experiences, having a clean mouth and good oral hygien can be a real booster for you personal life, and can make having intimate relationships a lot easier to get into, enjoy, and enhanced 
The product was delivered promptly and operates as advertised. It is light in weight and easy to use 
This has got to be one of the easiest blood pressure monitors to use. It really doesn't start until your arm is in the correct position, letting you know by beeping when you've got it right. The display is large and easy to read and understand. I definitely would recommend this 
After buying a scale from Amazon which didn't work and I had to return. I was skeptic about this. But it works great and very easy to use. I have never used such an excellent product 
I originally ordered a Tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks. (Amazon, of course, took it back with no problems.) I was so glad when the Omron scale arrived. It costs less than the Tanita but the quality is much higher. The numbers on it are very large and easy to read. Also, it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the Tanita. I can't wait to try all the features. By the way, I weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied .2 lbs. as promised. Great deal for the money!!! 
I compared this body fat monitor to similar ones from Tanita. You are definately getting more for your money here. It stores up to 4 users where the Tanita models only store 2 and compares function for function elsewhere at a lower price point. Not to mention that this scale just feels like better quality when you pick it up. I bought one with one of the Omron Pedometers to take advantage of the instant rebate on Amazon. (I haven't seen an event on Tanita on Amazon for a while.) The pedometer was the #1 rated in CR. They are both top notch products 
I like the fact that the infation is manual so less chance of malfuntioning. History feature is very convenient and very easy to operate 
This is a nice looking easy to use device. I wanted the simplist unit without air pumps and the need for chaning out batteries all the time. You Just turn it on, wrap the cuff around your arm, pump up the air bulb and let it go. The unit takes your pressure and pulse as it deflates 
This thing is awesome; easy to use, accurate, and long battery life. I use it most days in the morning to take a few readings and the batteries are still going strong eight months later. You could buy a fancier unit, but I didn't see the need. It fits my arm fine, but the band does seem a little small. You'd probably have buy the optional larger arm band if your arm is any bigger than average circumference. For this, I'll give it 4.5 stars. I really don't see why the band couldn't have been a little bigger. No more to say other than that I agree with the other positive reviews totally. If you are looking for the most bang for the buck and simplicity, make this your choice. 
This monitor is so easy to use, and more convenient than going to the grocery store. It saves the readings in memory, so if I don't have a pen and paper handy, I can retrieve the info later. It even shows the time the reading was taken. 
My only complaint is that it doesn't beep. I know this may sound strange, but my other one beeped the heartbeet and when it was finished. I just got used to it. Other than that, no complaints 
This blood pressure monitor is everything I was looking for and the price was certainly right. Thank you. It works perfectly 
i find the item in perfect shape and operates effectively thank you so much bimvik 
Consumer Reports just ran an online article on the Philips SCD 589 Baby Monitor, putting it through an "extreme" test, and it delivered with zero interference as promised. The highlights: "We devised a worst-case scenario to test the SCD 589, placing three models within 20 feet of two new Philips 1.9-GHz DECT cordless phones to see if they would interfere with each other... The SCD 589 lived up to its claim of being free of interference, even in our extreme test. There was no interference heard on any of the phones or baby monitors in our test... The SCD 589 also had some nice, if hardly essential, features the other models in our tests didn't. Those included a nightlight; an "intercom" that allows the parent to speak to the child remotely; and an alarm that sounds when the temperature in the child's room goes out of a certain range that parents can set." 
I'm cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard. I'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving. After years of trial and error, I've finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement. For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion. However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver. With the Gillette Fusion Power, I've finally found the right one. I've used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time). They've gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type. It doesn't take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades. I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar). Electric shavers don't work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I'd have a five-o'clock shadow around 2PM. So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot. I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers. But the Fusion Power is the happy exception. At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end. But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set. It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch). And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it. The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning. The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free. I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils. My only issue is the expense of the blades. But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave. And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it's more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else). Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price. The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I've ever tried. Highly recommended 
I mean come ON, who needs 5 blades right? Well, after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement that the Mach III was over a twin head razor, I decided that $10 was worth the price of a cheap thrill so I took the plunge, and to my surprise this thing works beyond my expectations. The first thing I noticed was that this new Fusion has a more powerful engine than the Mach III. The second thing I found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the Mach III, and with very little effort, and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore. And I find this razor to be very comfortable without a single nick that others have complained about. But I do use this razor strictly for my face if you know what I mean. haw haw 5 Blade 
I have just started potty training my grandson. He calls it Poppy...and that's okay if it helps him to go in the potty. The pants are great. I've always had to use traditional cloth and it is so nice to use throwaway traning pants. Thank you Pampers!!! 
I am very happy with this product. I put it on my boy for overnight and it does not leak at all 
Great diapers but they took forever to complete the order. By the time they arrived at my house my son was deciding between boxers or briefs 
I use this product on my son and my wife I just love it. we will no buy any othe product but this one. Unless we run out without placing the order..... but it's easy enough for him to pull it down then pull it back up when he's finished. very convenient 
Life is good and the batteries work the way they are supposed to work. Good value 
Great batts! Makes owning battery operated devices much less costly. Thanks for offering this product 
For the price...you can't beat Rayovac. Blow away those cheap "heavy duty" batteries and last almost or just as long as the premium brands. Amazon's price seems like it is the best other than Wal-Mart...who is priced about the same or just a little lower. Well worth the spend! 
If your looking for a bar that hits the spot without leaving you wanting more this is the bar for you provides great flavor and satisfies I highly recommend this bar for in between snacks not to high in fat has more carbs than other protein bars but is a great overall ba 
For once, I don't have to do a "public service" by going to clifbar.com and looking up the ingredients and nutritional information; Amazon.com has it all at the top of the product page. Now, I can focus on taste! That's a good thing, because this (along with the Clif Z-Bar, chocolate) is one of the better tasting "nutritional" snacks of its kind. It has just enough chocolate (brought to you by chocolate chips (which include organic cane juice, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa butter, and unspecified "natural flavors") to actually impart a chocolate flavor. Not a heavy or rich chocolate flavor, but an unmistakable one: You don't have to close your eyes, and convince yourself that it's chocolate. (Ever notice how permeable artificial flavors can be? Let's say you're eating a Popsicle--excuse me--a frozen fruit treat. You close your eyes, and the flavor clues are all but gone. Think purple, and its tastes like grape; think orange, and it's orange, think light blue and it's bubble gum--if you know the code, that is.) This is like a giant Bit-O-Honey candy, it has that chewy texture over laden with honey, with some sticky peanut butter and chocolate thrown in, and you've pretty much captured the flavor. To my surprise, there is no honey, that taste derives somehow from the syrups, malt, cane juice, fig paste, and other sweet ingredients. It's definitely filling, especially if accompanied by an apple or something, and at least eight ounces of water. It's very chewy, yet it doesn't seem as dry as similar products. Could it be the six grams of fat-two of which are saturated? Yes, two grams of saturated fat! NOT good. I'll try to balance that with the fact that it's made from 70% organic ingredients, has a whopping 11 grams of protein, only 20 grams of sugar (compare that with other brands and flavors), and includes five grams of fiber. Along with Clif's Z-bar and the excellent Clif apple raisin walnut, this is one of the better tasting of its kind--just don't expect a brownie 
I received the product quickly, it was in great shape, and I will buy more as soon as I eat all these up 
Clif Bars are amoung the best tasting energy bars I have ever tried. They may not pack as many calories or grams of protein as other brands, but there have been times where I could not even finish a competeing bar because of dismal taste or texture 
The best sports bar around. Great taste, organic, contains plenty of Antioxidants, and contains a good amount of protein. The only down side is the high amount of carbs, especially the sugars, but I still give it five stars 
Clif Bars have been part of my families life for a long time and provides a good quick meal or snack depending on your activity level. Definitely recommend having water available 
I've tried many types of nutrition bars and many are too sweet or they are not tasty. Clif bars get it right 
This is a variation of the classic pre-shave lotion, but in solid form. Main ingredient is parafin, a petroleum destilate grounded to a very fine powder and molded thru extrusion into a solid bar. Once it touches your face skin it pulverizes again and remains in the skin as a fine lawyer of talc-like powder. Contrary to apparences it lubricates the skin almost flawlessly. Of course if you press the electric shaver to much it will burn your skin! Nonetheless this is a high quality product (Made in Switzerland) that is why is rather on the expensive side, but it certanly delivers 100% on its intended use and purpose. I always keep 5 o 6 bars at one time in stock, because I know it's too good a product before it substituted by a chinese cheaper import 
After trying many pre-shaving products I found this to be the best one. The only problem is that it is hard to find, when I do I usually buy several 
This is a great product, have been using it for years. Tried other dry methods and they do not work nearly as well as this product 
I've been using this product for years. I can only use an electric shaver due to my sensitive skin. The powder forms a thin layer on the skin that allows the shaver to move a lot easier across the face while shaving 
I purchased several of them and it is burn free rash free, and easy to apply you do not have to use your fingers etc to apply it, and one sticks LASTS AND LASTS. It really makes shaving a joy, and not a chore, I just love using it and you will too. It is by far the BEST of the BEST pre-shave product on the market 
I really liked this product,so smooth,noiseless.very easy to use also less efforts required to remove hair......i will go again for it..... 
This razor is similar to the men's Gillette M3Power Razor. It uses one AAA battery, and it vibrates. One blade should last approximately three months in this razor. It requires little or no effort to remove hair with this razor. This razor can be used to swiftly remove hair from armpits, legs, or any other place a goddess can think of. Thank God for goddesses 
I've used all the Venus women's razors and this is my favorite out of them all. This is the only razor I've used out of the line that hasn't nicked me or cut me or left stray hairs. It leaves my legs smooth 
I was so excited about this product; but when I got it I was deeply dissatisfied. The box was damaged. It was bent inward at the lid on one side and around the drawers opening it was ripped on both sides. I will be returning this product for a replacement. I do think that the box is really cute. However if I receive another damaged box then I will never buy another thing from this website 
I was so glad to receive this before my son gets here. This keepsake chest will hold lots of different-sized items, and it is just beautiful! I got the matching photo album and baby book as well, and all items are high quality and so cute 
I really love the Keepsake box. The top opens up to fit the matching baby book right in it, to make a complete set. It is going to be nice to be able to pass this down to my daughter 
The cutest keepsake box. Has a flip-top lid which perfectly fits the matching record book, and has two drawers below that, one of which is divided into sections for smaller keepsakes. The bottom drawer is a good size to store the matching photo album too. On the lid is a frame for you to place a picture of your little one, that says "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" all around the frame. An excellent value, and it's very sturdy 
These bars are so delicious, you will be worried they're just candy bars. But they're not! They are packed with energy and nutrition that will keep you going and keep you healthy too. The flavor variety is unmatched on the market. The Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip Peanutbutter are my favorites, but the Oatmeal Raisin Walnut is also excellent, especially if you are hiking and have a canteen of water to go along with their very natural deliciousness 
They have a lot of vitamins in these suckers. I mean we're talking Vit. A, Vit. C, Calcium, Iron, Vit. E, Vit. K, etc. I don't know what all those nutrients do exactly but it shouldn't hurt. The only problem I have is that in this variety pack, the Crunchy Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch flavors are a little too similar that they pretty much taste the same to me. If you like peanut butter - great! If not, then probably try a different box but still try a clif bar out 
Clif bars make for a tasty and pleasant snack. They are perfect when you simply don't have a lot of time to get something into you to keep you going. [...]they are an excellent source of vitamins C and E. They are very chewy and satisfying; you won't need more than one or two before you workout. They are much more nutritious than a candy bar, too. However, this snack bar is not perfect. As another reviewer notes, there is quite a bit of sugar, carbohydrates and fat in each bar. This food bar is not for anyone on a salt free diet as it contains salt; and people with allergies to any kind of nuts should definitely not eat this food. Overall, Clif Nutrition Bars are useful for those of us who are not allergic to any of their ingredients and who want a healthier alternative to a candy bar. The Amazon price makes them affordable and I recommend them as a delicious snack food. 
If you are looking for new ways to incorporate soy products into your life, Clif Bars are one of the best tasting energy bars on the market. I've given up trying other bars that are mostly disappointingly filled with all sorts of oils I can't eat. Take cottonseed for example it is in everything! Not to mention, peanut butter and all the palm kernel oil saturating the health bar market. The ingredients in the Carrot Cake Bar: Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Soy Protein Isolate, Rice Flour, Malt Extract, Organic Soy Flour, Organic Roasted Soybeans, Organic Rolled Oats, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Dried Apples, Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors, Apple Fiber, Oat Fiber, Organic Milled Flaxseed, Chicory Extract, Psyllium, Organic soy Butter, Dried Carrots, Raisins, Coconut, Sea Salt, Nutmeg, Cinnamon and Cloves. Each bar is 240 Calories and is delicious for breakfast with a cup of tea. I eat a Clif Bar almost every morning and never really feel overly hungry during the day. Gary (The Owner of Clif Bar Inc.) seems to have also found out that "other" energy bars were not really that tasty. After his "epiphany," he spent lots of time in his Mom's kitchen working on making cliff bars. What a guy! I was at the point where I was trying to make my own granola bars, but after discovering these bars, I'm hooked. They are portable, delicious and basically, I love all the flavors. You can take them biking, hiking, walking, anywhere. This bar is especially delicious and I seem to fall in love with it again each October. Must be the spices and the creamy white chocolate chips. There are just enough chocolate chips to remind you of cream cheese icing. If I had to choose between a piece of carrot cake and one of these bars, the bar would win. Also look for the Cranberry Apple Cherry Bars and the Pumpkin Spice Bars. ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
About what you would expect, Clif Bars are awesome. I wish there was more variety in the box, and I didn't like the Oatmeal Raisin Walnut bar. It tasted very mineral-y 
Based on the reviews of other, I decided to order this product as I had several DVDs with deep scratches. The product really works 
I was VERY iffy about buying a DVD cleaner/repair kit because I have heard stories of some products ruinning discs. However, one of my DVDs from a Gilmore Girls DVD set was scratched and it wouldn't play in certain parts of an episode. I tried on several occassions to clean it myself but it never worked. I was afraid that I would have to replaced the whole set because there are no "single" discs for sale. I did some research on DVD repair kits and I was going to buy a more expensive one but decided to go with the cheaper one (plus it had positive reviews) in case it didn't work, I wasn't out a lot of money. I am MORE than pleased with the Scotch DVD cleaner and repair kit, as I used it on my damaged disc and five minutes later, it was in PERFECT condition and played perfectly!!!! I am HAPPY beyond words because now I can clean and repair my DVDs without worrying about replacing them. This is defintely worth the $9.99 price tag, it does works and is worth it! If you are new to buying DVD cleaner/repair kits, try this one... as it worked for me, so it might work for you!! :) Very satisfied customer here. : 
I saw this a few days ago it The Source by Circuit City... definitley worth the money! It repairs scratches and saved all of the DVDs that I used it on. So there's no other repair kit... buy it today, If you see it 
We LOVE this item!!! We get older TV show DVDs from Netflix and they generally are not in the best condition when they come. If the cleaner doesn't work, and it generally does, our back up is the repair stuff, which almost always does. I think out of 30 disks, only two were not fixed. 
I was surprised to open this pedometer page after sometime and see all the negative reviews it receives. I have been using this specific model for more than 3 months now and I am really satisfied with it. It is really accurate (1% declination, I have performed more than four tests of more than 400 steps during different times of its life and I have seen a couple of cheap pedometers performing much worse), clips firmly to belt or pants, displays the time conveniently and has nice backlight, even has a radio which works, although as most people said, not really its best feature. The truth is that I am not using the radio at all, mostly because I believe the batteries will last longer and it will save me from extra trips to Walmart. But I have tested it and it works, although nothing impressive there. Of course, for the money, I think you cannot go wrong with this pedometer. One funny comment is that, although most people complain it cannot open very easily, after sometime it will open more easily that you think. Actually it has been a couple of times where putting a bag on my shoulders or a waist pouch and applying some pressure on it by mistake, will open it wide, so it does not count any steps. But it does not open by itself anyway, needs external force for this to happen, so it does not happen often. All in all, I am sure that the plastic construction and the less than rigorous production testing will result in many pieces that do not function properly and will result in bad reviews. Maybe I have been lucky, maybe not, but this has been one of the best and most reliable devices that I carry and use every day. And a great incentive for walking and exercising more 
Although it kept time (which indicates the batteries were good) this didn't work the first day I used it. It worked the second day. It stopped working by the third day AND the battery cover broke off sometime during the day and was lost. This was a complete waste of $19 
My husband purchased the Pedometer with FM radio for me. I loved it and used it non-stop for about a week. After a week the battery case top fell off so I could not keep the batteries in. The FM radio worked only once - I thought I had a short in the headset. Good idea but really did not perform/last for the money 
A very good protein bar. The cookies and cream is very tasty, yet it is not too sweet. I find that the Builder's Bar has one big advantage over the regular Clif Bar (other than the protein of course): the Builder's Bar isn't super sweet. I really enjoy the regular Clif Bar but sometimes it leaves me feeling like I just ate a really sweet candy bar. The Builder's Bar doesn't suffer from that. The downside to the Builder's Bar, however, is that it does have a bit of saturated fat. In sum, not a bad bar and much tastier than many of the other protein bars I have tried 
I personally am addicted to these bars. I tell myself they are much better than regular chocolate bars and I do believe that. I actually prefer the taste of these to regular chocolate bars. 
I just finished a 4 day golf tournament that was brutal. 6 hour rounds played in 90 degree heat with high humidity. During a practice round a couple of days before the tournament started I really got drained of energy after about 12 holes. I was unprepared and it made a sport that I normally enjoy into an unpleasant experience. For the tournament rounds I packed a small cooler with Gatorade, Nature Valley Fruit and Nut bars, and chocolate flavored Clif Builder's bars. I drank water and gatorade throughout each round and alternated the bars every 3-4 holes. It really made a difference. Each day I felt like I had the energy and endurance for a great round. If only my golf game was as good as these bars. They tasted great and keeping them in a cooler kept them from melting in the heat. I highly recommend Chocolate Clif Builder's bars. Kevin Decke 
I bought these because I love the regular Clif bars. I ride my bike to/from work, so I thought I would use these as a kind of "breakfast replacement". They taste very good and they definitely hold you over until lunch. Although, I highly recommend having a glass of cold milk handy to wash it down 
I'm 26m, 6' 185 and growing. Work out regularly, mostly weights and basketball. I'm allergic to peanuts, which makes most protein bars off-limits for me. This is the only bar I've found where the non-peanut flavors don't contain trace amounts of peanuts to set off my allergies. Incredible, if for only that reason. But there's more. 20g of protein. Wow. This can be a meal replacement if you're on the road or it can be the mid-morning, early-evening or even late-night snack, especially if you're trying to build lean muscle and shooting for 1.5 or more grams of protein per pound of body weight. It's an easy 20. The carbs are real, as another review says. It's clean energy, to be effective either before or after a workout. I prefer to take in liquid protein after a workout, the body absorbs it faster, but in a pinch this would be a great choice. Beyond that it's a little crispy and a little chewy, there's a physical satisfaction from eating it that makes the experience complete. But, as another review said, this isn't intended to be a diet bar, it is for men women who work hard and use lots of energy throughout the day, hence the name "Builders Bar." I guess if you ate half of one instead of a meal, it might work that way. Finally the taste is outstanding, when stacked against other bars (although I haven't tried many, due to peanut allergies). If you close your eyes and pretend, it really could be a dessert. I stick to the cookies cream or chocolate. Chocolate is yummy dunked in hot coffee mid-morning. I buy a box every two weeks and keep stocked at home, work and oftentimes one in the car just in case I get hungry. Another review said the outside chocolate got crumbly, this is true, if it gets hot and melted. When the things solidify they crumble. Doesn't change the taste but it's messy. Keep them cool and you're in good shape. I've even tried putting them in the freezer prior to eating, not bad but no significant difference. Thank you Clif 
I read in Bicycling magazing that riders who ingest protien within the first 15 minutes of completing a ride, have faster muscle recovery rates and are in better shape for the next day. Last year I was always sore the next day after a long ride. After reading this article, I box some Clif Builder Bars due to their high protien content (20g). I have since been religiously eating them after each ride. I have yet to have sore muscles yet this year. In one of the local stores there is a Chocolate Mint flavor. It is yummy. 
I'm giving this a '4' because my husband likes them and took them from me to use after his weight lifting work-outs. But I tried one first: the outside chocolate was a bit crumbly probably due to shipping and storage. The taste was fair to real good for a high protein bar that doesn't use a lot of sugar alcohols to sweeten it, depending on your taste for such things. In other words it's not super-sweet but the sucralose (Splenda) gets the job done, if I remember correctly. It is SUPER for keeping you from getting hungry due to the fact that it has real carbs, not play carbs in it, to match it's high amount of protein - probably could be used for the Zone diet. You can last hours and hours on it. It's more than a meal. (This is NOT a dieter's bar, although with careful planning could be used as such.) We've tried a lot of bars and this is the best high protein bar yet that doesn't rely on sugar alcohols (otherwise, stick to South Beach Diet Bars. 
These bars are absolutely fantastic. They are very nutritious and have a good amount of protein (20g). They taste pretty good, far better than most bars. I prefer the builder bar cookies and cream flavor to that of the clif bar flavor. Out of the flavors my current favorite is the cookies and cream, next being the peanut butter, and then chocolate. A chocolate mint flavor has just been released but I have yet to try it. I recommend these bars to anyone looking for a healthy snack or needing protein for working out 
Just wanted to note that my delicious bars arrived MELTED as noted by another reviewer. I ended up placing in the fridge, and then taking out before eating. Turns out, I didn't find them that great directly from the fridge. Also, they just didn't taste as fresh as the ones I buy individually from Wal-Mart. I couldn't tell if that was because they had melted, or just weren't as fresh to start with 
Graet for consumers who want to get more protein in their diets without having to sacrifice the benefits of all-natural ingredients or great taste. Truly works 
I actually bought this book based on all of the negative reviews that it did not have enough "fill in the blanks." I wanted a baby book that would give me a topic and let me journal about it without too much prompting. There are a few fill-in pages (see below), but for the most part I can write my feelings and thoughts about my baby in my own words. This seems like a much more personal approach, and one I think my son will appreciate more when he is old enough to read it, than fill in the blank pages. A previous reviewer complained that the pages are thin and newspaper-like. True, they are simple white pages with black titles, but the pages themselves are not at all flimsy--thicker than the average novel page and more like lightweight cardstock. The illustrations are small, simple, and non-intrusive. Black and white line drawings that are more iconic than a cutesy. My only complaint about this baby book is that I would like more topics (birth story, tooth chart, food, favorite expressions, favorite toys/games. . .) However, the pages look like they are about 11" x 8.5" and it is bound with ribbon, so I think with a little creativity, cardstock and a hole punch I may be able to add my own pages. The topics that are covered are (with one full page allowed per topic): Baby's Name (fill in the blanks) Family Tree (line illustration fill in the blanks) All About Mom All About Dad Expectations Parties Showers (2 pages) First Impressions Birth Certificate Handprints Footprints Lock of Hair Visitors Gifts First Family Photo Firsts (fill in the blanks) Baby's Favorite Things Doctor Visits Growth Chart (fill in the blanks) Medical Records (fill in the blanks) First Birthday Second Birthday Third Birthday First Vacation Holidays Celebrations Letter From Mom Letter From Dad Keepsakes Reflections There is also a small pouch for baby's first haircut, and pockets in the back to store cards, documents and other loose memorabilia 
The product it's exelent but You didn't ship yet my item, so I'm waitting for it........the delivery service it's to bad. Please notify me if you going to delivery it or if it's better no to wait for it 
This book is beautiful outside, I love the lace up binding and place for picture on the front. What I do not like is how there is no specific places to write in, you just have to use your imagination as to how to word and to position things on each page..too much like scrapbooking for me, I wanted a book with blank lines and spots to write in..For example one blank page will say, "All About Mom" then another that says "Baby Shower" etc..but the pages are blank. I need more structure 
This baby book is awesome! It is very beautiful. It is very different from the traditional baby books and more like a scrapbook. It is not a big questionare book like the others. For example there are headers at the top of the pages (i.e. All About Mom or Parties Showers) and you fill in the page anyway you'd like 
Unbeatable for the price! Worked fine right out of the box. Easy to use and easy to understand instructions. I'm glad I bought it 
This is a great hand held body fat analyzer. Very accurate, consistent readings and very user friendly. It takes about one minute to set up the personal information that it needs and takes a few seconds to get the body fat readings, very fast. I was a little worried about buying this item because the lack of reviews but did notice another Omron HBF-306 fat Analyzer that had alot reviews. I don't know why this item doesn't have as many reviews as the other Omron HBF-306 fat Analyzer, when it is the exact same product, plus what made me buy this one instead of the other is it's cheaper and free shipping. So overall great product for the price 
I have an incandescent floor lamp and the Clapper works great with it. OTOH, another lamp is fitted with fluorescent bulbs, and the Clapper doesn't work at all. I called the manufacturer and only then was told that the Clapper will not work with a fluorescent fixture. Nowhere is that mentioned. Beware 
What a disappointment! The device just wasn't predictable. Sometimes it would do as expected, sometimes not. It was just a crapshoot. Finally unplugged it and it's in a drawer somewhere. Yes, I played with the sensitivity with no success. Getting up to turn lights on and off was far less effort and aggravation than trying to convince The Clapper to do its thing. Save your money and look elsewhere 
kept the sensitivity switch set for home, plugged it in and it works. have had it almost a week and it hasn't gone off unintentionally yet. two claps with a slight pause between works perfectly to turn it on and off. works just fine for the price 
I just got this and loved it. Noise from my TV didnt set the lights off neither did shouting at my relatives. there needs to be a pause between the sound so it doesnt really get set off unless you time yourself clapping. It's great especially for me because i have a light that you plug in on the other side of my room so it was a pain to turn on the lights at night when there was complete darkness 
you know how it works. i read a lot of reviews saying it detects any noise. i have mine in my bedroom on the medium setting and the really the only thing that sets it off accidentally is the vacuum cleaner. im sure if you put it near a door or in a very noisy room your results will vary 
These wipes are just right for cleaning a dirty baby bottom. I've used the Pampers Sensitive Wipes and they just don't do the cleaning part very well. They also tend to stick together. They are soft but you buy these for cleaning up poop, not for caressing your baby. I prefer the Pampers diapers but after trying both, these work much better. Be 
I don't have a baby in my house. But they say they're thick, but noticibly, Donna, who lives in Mt. Hope, NY, has a baby, and has the Pampers wipes, which they are cloth-like. Many times close to me for some kind of baby shower my mom used to buy Pampers wipes for the baby 
I take a medication that seems to mess with my immune system and the Holiday season is especially difficult for me. My daughter introduced me to Airborne a few years ago, but I wouldn't use it because it contained aspartame. When I came across this new one I decided to try it. I wasn't influenced by any celebrity because I hadn't heard anything from anyone. This stuff works for me AND my husband who is stuck in an office of people who are less than considerate with keeping their germs to themselves. He has yet to get sick this year, when usually he would have had at least one bad cold by now. We honestly LOVE this product 
Inaccurate. The same issues that plague cheaper scales. I might accept this if it was a $20 scale, but it isn't. A scale this price should at least be able to produce accurate weight readings. Do not buy if you can find something comparable with good accuracy 
Very nice looking scale that fits decor wise into any of our 3 bathrooms. Accurate body fat readings plus an accurate scal 
My 13 daughter suffers from consistent nosebleeds during the winter months. This cute little humidifier fits conveniently on the corner of her desk. Unlike most humidifiers, it is so quiet that you can't hear it at all. The only way you know it is running is by the cool mist venting from the top. It is also the lowest maintenance humidifier that we've ever owned and better yet, of all the high $$ units I have purchased throughout the years, this one gets the job done and done well 
At the first two days the product worked just fine (misty and quiet). After the second refilling the humidifier started to make noises (a motor like sound the first 10 minutes and heavy drops sound all the time). - So I had to return it. Secondly, to refill the tank you have to remove it and turn it upside down - Water always get spilled on my carpet during that process 
I purchased this for my baby's room and because winters are extremely dry in Colorado. It is a lot bigger than I thought - that's not a bad thing. It is extremely easy to use... just fill up and push the on button. The instructions are very simple. One thing I like about it is that it is ultrasonic (it uses a metal diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency to create water droplets. It is not loud, and also produces a cool fog.). No extensive cleaning needed, no adding bleach to the water, etc. It does the job great. There is one little thing that bothers me... the on light is green (it turns red if it runs out of water) and it is very bright at night. I like my room to be dark and this tiny light really lights up a room. I did cover it up with some electrical tape and now it doesn't bother me. Other than the light (which was an easy fix), I love this humidifier 
My work demands a lot of interpersonal contact, face-to-face, over-the-phone, and written. Recently I have moved the more intimate of these communications off the electronic impersonality of email and onto quality stationery. At the same time, I've bought two fountain pens, my first ever, combining this black Cross Century II with its silver-and-gold twin. One stays at the office and one by my writing desk here at home. In the mix, I find that I'm discovering a new art form and means of personal expression. Always an illegible writer, the stationery and the fine pen slow me down just enough to realize that I actually *can* write. It is difficult to overestimate the potency of a hand-written note in the Age of Email. It is a bit of chosen retro-referencing upon which the recipients of my letters comment with appreciation. And it doesn't take *that* much time. The Cross Century II can be considered near the top of the entry-level pens. I chose them because of good experience with Cross ballpoints, not wanting to spend too much until I figured out whether this was going to work, and my routinely bad experience with base-entry-level products. I believe this pen is likely to serve me for years to come. As I learn the beauty of a fine or solid stroke, however, I also widen my peripheral vision and discover there's a high-end pen store at my local shopping center. Uh-oh 
I loved the pen with but two reservations. (1) I wish it also came in a FINE nib, the medium ink flows like silk, but it's a bit thicker than I prefer. (2) Foolishly I leaned over the side of a boat with the pen.... bloooop.... This pen doesn't float very well. Unfortunately it's hard to list that as a defect worthy of replacement by cross. This pen is worth WAY more than it's listed fo 
My newly purchased Cross Century II Black Fountain Pen is a superb writing instrument. I love to write (by hand more than computer) and the Cross Century II Black Fountain Pen exceeded my expectations. If you truly enjoy "Old Timey" writing, buy one and really enjoy the art of writing. James Taylo 
If you want to use a fountain pen for daily work this one will work well. You won't be out of a lot of money if you lose it 
I love my pen, it's great. It completely fulfilled what the information stated 
This product works well for hands free reading. It is especially good for heavy books that are hard to keep open. This product is for you if you have arthritic hands 
I have had a PUR water pitcher for about 6-7 years now. It's a good filter, the water tastes fine. I was a bit worried when I bought these filters that maybe my old pitcher wouldn't fit the newest filters, but everything worked well. I would recommend the PUR water filter pitcher to anyone. 
The blade and foil combination is the least expensive way to go to replace both of these parts. They fit, look and feel EXACTLY like the original 
Replacing the inner blade and outer foil on my Panasonic shaver made ALL the difference. I didn't realize why, but finally noticed that the shaver wasn't working well. After replacing the blade and foil, it takes a fraction of the time and produces a much smoother shave 
Changing out the outer foil and blades was a breeze. Though my morning shave wasn't bad, with the new blades in place, it is great. I rarely use a shave gel or cream, and I still get a fast and smooth shave. I had forgotten how good it can be. Just like having a new shaver again 
brought my Panasonic shaver back to new, BUT I have had problems with geting "pimples" if I do not clean it enough, and then still sometimes anyway. After reading about the new shavers that come with a cleaning/drying stand I decided to soak it in 90% isopropanol after each use and then dry it off with a hair dryer (~1 min blades/foil head), solved the problem, no more pimples on my face 
The product works great. I didn't realize how much closer my shave would be 
Good razor but blades don't last long enough and are expensive 
I went too long without replacing the blades and foil on my shaver. Shaving was getting to be a real chore. But replacing these was like getting a whole new shaver! It sounded and felt different, and I could feel I was getting a much closer shave. The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that after a month or so of use, I have noticed the blades have already dulled a bit. I may start replacing mine every 6 months or so. But even then, compared to what people pay for those refills for their fancy Mach 7 Nitro Nuclear Fission razors, I think we're getting a good deal 
The Replacement Blades Foils for My Panasonic Razor made it work like brand new and at a fraction of the cost of a new razor. Why buiy a new razor when you can make it work like a new razor 
i'm getting a close shave with this baby. good stuff. replace your inner blade and foil once a year 
i bought this unit and it was a piece of junk . It omitted way to much ozone which is the same as omitting smog in your house. That is what the smell is that comes from this unit. Please research ozone emitting air purifiers before you buy one. try google. When I tried to returned it a week after buying it Ionic Zone would not respond to my emails and I had to go through Amazon to get a refund. This unit is noisy and useless!! 
I liked the fast delivery on my air purifier. I also like that it cleans and freshens the air around me, it gets rid of all the smoke in the house, especially here in the room. Thank you again, I am very pleased with my purchase 
I read some online reviews in Amazon before I decided to buy this product. Some of the users said this unit is silent when it's working. So I was expecting it to be silent, or at least not making noisy sound when put it on the lower speed. However, mine is not 'silent' at all. You can hear the fan running all the time and the sound is really distracting. To be honest, I am very disappointed with this little machine. I guess I will use it only when I am not in the room. 
Looked around for an ion air cleaner for a while and decided on this item. It works as advertised and won't break the bank with filters. I use it in a small office with no ventalation. Keeps the room from smelling stale 
The unit seems to be well built, works, and is inexpensive compared to other units.. but it is small, for a larger house i would reccommend several units perhaps one for every large room you have. 
This product has far exceeded my expectations. It is very inexpensive and perfect. I leave it on all day/night long on low in my bed room and the air feels so fresh. I cannot hear the unit at all, it's great. I highly recommend it. 
i personally do not use it, but my mother-in-law seems like it more than me. 
I offer this not as a professional opinion. There is no consensus on this. I just offer this as an off-the-record word-of-mouth opinion. But... In the past several weeks, I have heard a few different Psychiatrists I work with, people I respect, tell me they have patients who take Omega-3 fatty acid supplements and believe that it helps with mood stabilization. (This, in addition to the other well publicized below-the-neck benefits.) So, take it for what it's worth. It's a relatively benign supplement, I've heard people worry about mercury but it should be filtered out of any quality supplements. If it helps, great. If it doesn't help, no harm done. Probably. Again, I'm not talking about double-blind controlled studies, just cocktail party quality anecdotes. Even so, I thought you'd want me to share. They always say it is better to get your nutrition from foods as opposed to supplements, but if you eat enough fish to get the same equivalent of omega-3 fatty acids, you will be consuming some mercury. I'm not a toxicologist, I don't know how big of a deal that is or isn't. Having given my off-the-record opinion, I'll now give my expert opinion: Talk to your doctor about any supplements or herbal medications you are interested in taking. And, please, talk to your doctor if you feel you need a mood stabilizer and this hasn't been professionally evaluated. If your doctor is in too much of a hurry, or too dismissive, time for a new doctor 
I've been giving this supplement to my husband, who was diagnosed with Huntington's disease last year. As an adjunct to his other therapies, this product has made a noticeable improvement in his overall well-being. The choreatic movements he experiences have improved tremendously, and his emotional and cognitive state is more stable than it has been in several years. It is no accident that this supplement was recommended by his doctor. If there's mercury in it, my husband must have needed a good dose of mercury 
This supplement is USP verified (http://www.usp.org/USPVerified/dietarySupplements/) so the previous two reviewers may be making too strong statements. Under the certification the supplement may not contain, among other things, any harmful amounts of mercury 
Many fish oil products have Mercury contamination and are NOT filtered out. This product does not state that it is Mercury free. So far the only product that was certified Mercury free was only available from my medical doctor 
I participated in a diet study in the late 1990's coducted by the Oregon Health Sciences University on the effects of Fish Oil and Retinitus Pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease. Fish oil was believed to alleviate some of the problems with this condition. I was a control volunteer without eye problems and was used solely as a baseline for this study. My assigned dose was 15000 MG per day, or 15 capsules - 5 with each meal. This is 5 to 6 times the dosage recommendations on the bottle. In a nutshell, the physiological change over 4 months was remarkable at this dosage. My blood pressure reduced significantly, the "good lipid" HDL levels went way high, the "bad lipid", LDL, went way down. My skin and hair were very healthy, even during the dry winter months. And although it may just be a symptom of being healthier, libido increased dramatically as well. The only side effects of this routine was the occasional "fish burps" as mentioned by other users, but these aren't as bad when you take the capsules after a meal or right before bedtime, and over time you do get used to the gaseous anomolies. The benefits far outweigh the side effects. I recommend taking at least 10,000 Mg a day for best results. Just remember, each capsule is 25 calories, all from fat. You may need to reduce other fats in your diet as to not gain weight at this dosage level. Stick with it, and the results after a few months may amaze you 
I feel it's a good product but I keep burping up awful fish breath 
This is one of the easiest and best ways to add Omega 3 to one diet. Think healthy 
I got into Aquis microfiber towels because my aged mother does not have the arm strength for big fat terry towels. I then bought some for myself because besides being light they absorb like crazy -- one swipe and you're dry. I decided to get one of the 'adventure' line because information was that they are like the dog-drying towels which are very like the lisse crepe ones. What I didn't realize was not only I buying a very nice towel, it comes in a very nice little nylon zippered bag, mesh on one side to facilitate drying. We're talking the sort of little bag you'd spend about $5 to buy from a travel gear catalog. I was thrilled to pieces. Also in keeping with the 'adventure'-travel theme, these towels have little tags on one corner that can be snapped back on themselves to form a loop to hang the towel from. Very handy for camping, meaningless but not annoying for home use. I like how the loop normally is just a long tag so that the loop does not tangle in the washer 
I needed a towel to use while away on business I do not like using the hotel towels because they are not big enough for me. I loved the microfiber towel it did not take up a lot of room and it dries quickly. I would tell a friend 
I have several in my car, sports, beach and gym bags. The Fabric: * Lisse Crepe -- their original towel. * Texture: very short pile, no visible loops. * Slightly clingy, when drying yourself. * A little static in the dryer (but not as much as their microfibre "terry" version) * Very absorbent and lightweight. * Comes in many colours and sizes. Unlike other membrane/spongy camping/outdoor towels: * You CAN throw this is in the dryer. * Feels closest to a real towel. * XL size covers up more for modesty. Sizes and uses: *Size XL is best as a bath towel, b/c you can coverup. *Size L was the original hair/gym towel size -- longer and narrower. Good for a small child. *Size M is good as a Hand Towel for when you have people over. It gets damp but not soggy and will still do its job of drying hands. 
I purchased this towel for gym use after an older microfiber towel finally wore out after several years, and after a couple of months of use, it's been a very good purchase. It doesn't have the same loops one is used to from regular terry-cloth towels, but it's very, very soft and absorbant, and has been since the first time I used it. (The cleaning instructions say not to use fabric softener, and I don't.) It dries very quickly, so it's ideal for gym use. Unlike cotton towels, it doesn't get that nasty odor that sometimes happens. The size is extremely generous, but it also fits easily in a gym bag when folded. One probably wouldn't want to use it at home in place of regular terry-cloth towels, but you certainly could. It would also make a good purchase for college students in dorms, since it dries quickly, even when hanging 
I personally like the darker color for my muddy dogs (and keep the red for myself!) These towels are great for travel or everyday use - soft, absorbant, and dry quickly 
I purchased 2 of these to use in our Airstream Travel trailer. They are wonderful -- soft and they dry fast. Also a very nice color. They wash nicely and dry without any wrinkles. Microfiber towels sure have come a long way....these are expensive...but you get what you pay for 
This is the worst hair setter that I have ever purchased! They get too hot to handle, but the worst are the flimsy clips they give you to "hold" them in place. They are so cheap that when you slide them in over the roller, they stretch; therefore, not holding in the curler. They fall out as soon as you let go of them!!!! 
Ok, there I said it. But anyone who takes protein powders knows exactly what I am talking about. This doesn't leave you with any after-taste and is extremely tasty and the ingredients are top notch. Much better then "Designers Whey". I had to hide this from my wife because the chocolate tastes like a chocolate brownie. 
This is an awesome protein powder. It tastes great and seems to have have the right components 
MMMMMM the taste is mind blowing...i feel hyped up whenever i drink this...its got like a steroid effect in it without actually having it...VERY NICE 
I love this charger. I bought one and a Canon digital camera. I loved them both and I gave them to my daughter as a moving away present. I then bought another Canon digital camera and the same charger. I don't understand why anybody would be willing to wait longer to charge the batteries when this is so convenient. I have charged several different brands of batteries with both chargers and neither ever gave me any trouble at all 
I picked these up for my sons digital camera/video recorder as he was always running out of juice w/ the regular rechargeable batteries. These are working great for him- now he keeps going and going and going. Maybe I'll switch them back!LOL Seriously, these do work great and do charge much quicker than the regular versions- to us, well worth the money 
This is the fastest charger I could find Amazon had it the cheapest. Also, it was a name brand, which I like to buy for these types of electrical items. It has a fan to cool down the batteries which get pretty hot during charging. I am very satisfied with this product. The only negative is that it is fairly bulky for travel use it comes as 2 pieces - one is the actual charger and one is the AC cord, which has a large block as the plug. 
Much more convenient than a conventional mop, but in the end, it's still mopping. I don't know if I would describe it as "fun" as some of the other reviewers have, but it's definitely less of a chore than the old mop and bucket method. It gets the floor pretty clean. I have only hardwood floors in my house, so I used the hardwood cleaner for this, and sometimes it leaves a residue. Overall, it's okay 
Can't say enough about how great this is. Such a time saver, it makes cleaning the kitchen and bathroom floors fast and easy!! 
It didn't seem possible that the Swiffer Wet Jet could work as well as the commercials. It doesn't. It's useful, though. Although I use the Swiffer Max, Swiffer Wet, and the Swiffer Wet Jet, I still find it necessary to use the dutch broom and the sponge mop every week or so to get the floor really clean. 
It's a good thing, a step up from previous mopping systems. It could be if I understood all the features better I would get better results. If it came with a booklet explaining it, then my wife must have put someplace weird because I never saw it. I never would have thought a mop would require an instruction booklet, but it does. Really bad stains still have to be scrubbed hands and knees style, which I hoped this would eliminate. I like it though. Maybe in a couple of years there will be something further evolved along these lines that will really be the best I can imagine. 
After years of watching my father fall asleep in his chair, with his head all askew, I purchased one of these for his Christmas. He uses it all the time!!! And I just got one for myself. These truly are the best out there. The clever little snap keeps it in place and makes all the difference in the world. A great product and a great value 
I spend a great deal of time traveling and a good travel pillow is priceless. This is the best one I have ever bought! It has a good firmness to it, and the contouring gives you a great 'nook' to put your head into. The memory foam is very resilient and bounces back into shape quickly. The removable cover it a terrycloth material, which is soft and easy to clean. My husband and I both have one, and even though there is a great difference in our sizes, we both find it very comfortable. At such a great price, I would recommend it to anyone. It is far superior to any inflatable or bead filled pillow which is all I can usually find at the airports 
This item is sturdy, fits securely into tub. is also comfortable to sit on 
This is a very sturdy and useful item. It is strong enough to support a heavy person, is adjustable in height over a wide range, fits well in a standard bathtub and cleans up easily afterward 
I'm a 46 year old, overweight, active woman who just suffered through my second ankle surgery in two years. Both surgeries have left me non-weight bearing for 6 weeks and at least 12 weeks on crutches. I'm an avid exerciser, but by no means am I in shape. I purchased this for my second surgery. I'd already experienced trying to precariously balance on one foot in the shower after my first surgery and I didn't want to do that again. Ther bench is comfortable with a curved grey seat. It has holes for drainage. The legs feel sturdy and are adjustable. I don't feel like I'm going to tip over in the shower even though I've moved it to the tallest position to aid me in standing. The seat has two handles formed on the narrow edges and sturdy rubber feet to keep it from slipping. It is lightweight and easy to move. You need to put it together. I seemed to need another washer to attach the seat to the legs, but other than that it was really quick. You will need a phillips head screwdriver. The shipping was free. The price was low. The quality is excellent. The seat is comfortable. It's very stable. It's durable. What more could I ask for? After my first surgery, I got around on crutches and used a bag taped on my leg with waterproof tape to keep the cast dry. This time I've planned much better. I'm using: XeroSox Pro-Pump to keep the cast dry - It's wonderful, heavy duty. No tape or mess. You can easily pump the air out and submerge. The pressure of pumping the air out on my ankle is painful so I can't pump the air out. The opening is tight enough that I can pull it high on my thigh and still remain perfectly dry in the shower. It has a skid proof durable sole. Crutch Mate Arm Pads - Pretty easy to put on. I could feel the front and back edges under my arms so I put it over the exsisting pads. Very nice. Walker - My husband got this for me because he knew how hard it was for me to hop on one foot on crutches while on morphin. I was reluctant, but it's wonderful. The stability is worth it, especially getting in and out of the shower. Roll-a-bout - I haven't used this much because I'm still housebound, but I've met a few people who love it. Its so much easier than crutches. Office chair on wheels - This is my life saver. We leave one in the kitchen and I scoot wherever I need to go. It offers easy mobility and comfort. A wheelchair wouldn't easily fit in my small home so this has been great.  I Want That Body - exercise, weight lifting dvd. There was no way I was going on crutches again without strengthening my arms. This is a wonderful, easily achieved tape for all ages. My 19 and 22 year-olds use it and so do I. It's easily modified for any fitness level. Read the reviews. I hope this is helpful! Good luck!  
I bought one of these at a local store. When my sister visited and used it, she liked it better than any she had used. She lives in Texas so I looked for an online source and found it at Amazon. The price was so good that even with shipping she didn't pay anymore than I had. It arrived there in 2 days and she is delighted. It's lightweight and rustproof; easy to assemble 
Lacks directions for assembly and I could not get them from the seller. Assembles reasonably well -- I assume I got it right -- and works fine 
This is a very well made bench, very sturdy and comfortable. Altho it is WAY too big for a standard bathtub, is great for a stall shower. I gave 4-stars instead of 5 because of its inappropriateness for a bathtub 
I originally purchased this for my mother, who has very dry, brittle, 35 years of dyeing, hair. It wasn't "strong" enough for her. I have 40ish hair with highlights, no gray, but coarse. It has softened my hair and makes it lie flat, not frizzy 
This is exactly what I expected and works very good. Worth the cost 
The smell is refreshing, different, pretty, and sensual. You can wear this fragrance for everyday wear. It has not set off allergies of those around me like some perfumes do. This bottle is a must have 
Green Tea by Elizabeth Arden is a light refreshing perfume that is good for both day time and night time 
Euphoria is one of the most beautiful fragrances I've tried in a long time. The scent is simliar to Chanel's Chance, which I absolutely love. It's soft yet somewhat sophisticated. So why only one star? It doesn't last. I sprayed on a generous amount and half an hour later could barely detect a hint of the fragrance, even when holding my wrist directly under my nose. I repeated this experiment (since I had bought the bottle) several days in a row, always with the same result. Bottom line is that Euphoria, while a great fragrance, has very poor staying quality and at its price is not a good value 
The name of this products fits it perfectly.. this perfume is absolutely awesome.. i LOVE it..and will certainly buy more of it!! 
I am very happy with this perfume and it is the best that I have ever had 
Calvin Klein Euphoria is a MUST have fragrance. It is very sensual and lasts all day, yet isn't overpowering. A perfect blend of black violet, pomegranate, black orchid, mahogany wood, persimmon, and lotus blossom. Not too sweet or spicy --Just right! I get many compliments on it throughout the day. Kudos to Calvin Klein. I just bought it for myself for Christmas, however, I paid $70 for the 3.4 ounce at the department store. I've added to my wish list and I'm sure future purchases will be made with Amazon at great savings. 
Between prime shipping and the savings in the grocery section, this is a great value for wipes. We don't have children yet, but we use it to clean up our puppy and ourselves, works well. 
Very dry In comparison to other brands that we have utilized. Based solely on price point we decided to give this product a try and are, and will be, disappointed since we opted for price over quality when we purchased 3 cases. We have found that we're using two to three times the amount of wipes as compared with other brands. I recommend avoiding this particular item 
I was on the fence in light of the reviews, but I decided to give them a try b/c of the price and I had a gift card. They were actually as good as the good reviews. I didn't have any problems with them. I thought they were about the same size and based on the weight and number, they may just be a smidge thinner/smaller. However, I didn't notice. They are just wet enough to handle most jobs with one. I found most Huggies wipes to be a little rough and Pampers wipes to be too wet and tore easily. Luvs was right in the middle. Definitely my favorite 
The bulk package of Luvs wipes was a good value for the money 
This is great product. I like it much more than huggies, and it is also cheaper 
The wipes are quite small and very thin. Not very helpful for those 'messy' ones, especially when you have to use twice as many 
We have been ordering these wipes for almost a year. After trying nearly every kind in the store, we saw this product on line and decided to give it a try. Now that our son is older, we use so many wipes, that it is silly and overwhelming if we don't buy them in bulk. Sometimes the web also offers coupons you can use online. These wipes are MUCH cheaper than the huggies, and of better quality. (Huggies- 4.8 cents ea. Luvs- 2.8 cents each) 
I got this for my wife last year for Christmas and she liked it so much she thought it would be a great thanks gift for family and friends, we've already given out 10 of them with rave reviews. The aromatherapy was a nice touch we didn't even know it had. Highly recommend. 
My chiropractor advised me to apply heat on my tense neck and shoulders, but until now the only heat that worked came from a hot shower. Since I bought this product I use it first thing in the morning while preparing lunch boxes (it is amazing how it stays perfectly in place when walking or bending) and at night while watching a TV program. I noticed a big difference after a few days. Also I put it sideways when I am sitting down since my problem is mainly on my left shoulder and even backwards to release the tension from the front muscles of my neck. 
This is a great tool for relaxation and pain relief. However be aware that as it heats it does get damp and it does from time to time have a 'burnt smell. The smell occurs even with just a few minutes. I tend to check and "fluff" it often while heating it and I still get the smell. The smell is not overly unpleasant and it does tend to quickly fade. Even with the smell I think it is a great product. 
This is absolutely the best one you could get! It sits easily on your neck,and doesn't fall off. It holds the heat for a very long time. The fragrance I love. I have even been taking it to bed to use as a heating pad for different areas, and fall asleep with its warmth. I have been telling others about it, and would not hesitate to give it as a gift to others. I LOVE it! Great value for your money 
This product is just what it says. My Mother has arthritis in her shoulder and this helps with the pain. I would recommend this to anyone that has arthritis pain for relief 
This neck wrap is great. The shape is what I like the most about it. It sits comfortably on the shoulders and actually provides warmth to those areas. I've used the long skinny heat wraps in the past and they aren't thick enough - they just dangle at the front. The "C" shape of this one is nearly perfect. I microwave mine for 2 1/2 minutes. I threw away the little scented pouch - it's overpowering and not my kind of scent. -1 star because some of the filling has come out of the interior pouch but it stays in the outer cover. I've only had it for a week. I'll repair it when I wash the cover. 'til then, it's no big deal. 
Neck pillows have long been a necessity for me when traveling - -if the heads lolls to the side interrupting sleep a chance for a total departure from consciousness may be lost! Now magical buckwheat comes to the rescue, swathed in the comforting softness of a removable chenille cover. In this "HAPPY WRAP" it combines with moist heat hints of scent, primarily lavender. Microwaves are usually available for a 2-minute heating-up and that guarantees a deliciously therapeutic tension-melt-down. The value increases greatly for someone like myself who is convalescing or must sleep sitting up. Reviewer mcHAIKU reminds readers that recovery can be contingent on sufficient sleep. One's health gains mightily from total relaxation and near-meditative surroundings. For me this "purple passion" has become a life-saver 
I love my Happy Wrap! I have neck arthritis from years of computer work. I heat the wrap for about 2 minutes in the microwave, BUT I advise to remove the scent pack before warming (to save it from burning). It stays warm for about an hour. Also to note is that it is a moist type of heat when warmed up - the best kind of heat for sore muscles. Enjoy 
It worked very well in my opinion, though I don't have back pain like the previous reviewer. Very good buy 
No offence to Homedics but this is a bad product. I have back pain on a daily basis and this massager didn't massage anything, it only aggravated the pain. The only thing this does is vibrate very lightly and if you have back spasms like I do, you know that unless someone is kneading your back (or simulating) your spasms will get worse if it's just vibrating. I got no relief from this 
I ordered the wrist monitor and found it very easy to use. It registers quickly and saves the information for comparisons. I would recommend this to product to anyone with hypertension 
unreliable! Abnormally high readings, when i crosschecked my BP with another BP machine it was normal, this happens ALWAYS! Not a goood product! I want to returnt it now 
It works fine. I now know my blood pressure without going to the doctor. I could do it directly in my house. Since I know now, I could better control my blood pressure and watch my health 
I never recieved this item...it was out of stock for 2 months with promises of delivery every other week. I purchased something else locally. If you have no intentions of restocking an item...you should say so from the beginning 
I bought this to use at work and it does fine so far, as long as you do not have a larger than average wrist. Readings are very inaccurate if you are a person with an oversized frame 
Hugo Boss is definitely an interesting and yummy cologne for men. I bought Gio Armani for husband in the past. However, the price for a small bottle turned us away from it. The size of the bottle and the price makes this a great value. One word of caution is to go easy with the amount that you spray on. It is potent. My husband normally squirts 3 sprays onto his neck. He started out with one spray and it is strong. The aroma lasts all day. It is sweet and spicey which makes it unique. While I was nervous to buy a cologne without testing it first, it was a no-brainer after reading reviews on other websites. You will not regret purchasing this cologne! 
this is a great product i will purchase it again, through my favority shopping site AMAZO 
My latest obsession is with colognes and I bought all 10 of the ones mentioned in "So you want to start wearing cologne" guide on amazon.com, plus a few others. They haven't all arrived yet, but I have to say that this cologne is awesome. It's a brighter and more cheery scent (if there is such a thing) than Cool Water which is also pretty dern good, and less citrusy than Tommy. The price is pretty mid-range for the designer colognes and both my wife and I love it. It is not pretentious, more fun-loving and great for all occasion wear and lasts a long time. The high notes last maybe 2-3 hours but the lingering scent is fine all on its own. I am going through this much quicker than the others with Candies being a close second. If you're willing to spend the money get this one, if you'd like to spend ten or fifteen bucks less for another great one get CANDIES which is more spicy but still awesome as well. I liked this one so much that I have HUGO DARK BLUE on its way and look forward to reviewing it for you. Hope this helps 
The chair is comfortable, easy to adjust and was easy to assemble. The massager is okay but it could be a little more forceful 
The other reviews are right: this is more of a "vibrating" chair than a massage chair. However, $80 is a pretty good price for a leather office chair, and I just see the "massaging" function as a bonus. The chair is fairly sturdy and looks good. 
Amazon should provide rating less than 1, like a 0 or -1. I would have rated this -1 or even lesser. Its not a massage chair, its a VIBRATOR Chair. As soon as I got the delivery, I started charging, but it only took 10 secs to know its vibrating instead of massaging. Immediately switched of , packed and returned. Its too good to be true that they're selling a massage chair for around $80 unless its a crap. I would go for one of those portable shiatsu massage 
For the price this is the greatest, it is comfortable and the massage feature is very tingly. The only problems I see with this chair is the width of the seat, if you have wide hips this might not be the chair for you. The other thing is the controls for the massage are bolted to the seat on the side so it's very awkward to ajust them with out bending clear over or having a tiny hiny. We really love our chair though 
I spent nearly 3 hours in trying to assemble the chair and found out in the end that there were 2 screws missing. So spent again 3 more hours disassembling it. Go to a physical shop and buy comfort products. Never buy online. You will suffer the pain i went throug 
Great chair for the money! My girlfriend (for whom it was a gift) finds it very comfortable even without the massage motors on, and the massage function itself works very well 
The quality of the actual chair is better than I expected. I wish that the massage motor unit(s) were more powerful. Overall, I would buy it again! T 
When I started to use it I felt tickles. The same day I started trying this sensation began to disappear and could use it just fine. Does the job just as expected and it even has a light that can come handy at certain times. Happy with this product 
Not that you can say much about rechargable batteries but this ones come with a good price for a 3-pack and besides you always need more than one just in case you run out of your current one 
I replaced standard alkaline 9V batteries with these, in some devices that draw pretty heavily. I'm impressed...when charged, these have more "oomph" to them than a regular battery 
These batteries charged just fine, but I have not had a chance to test their longivity. I would assume they would be fine 
WOW... I put these batteries in my Vintage 1975 Pocket Football game and they worked. Imagine that Batteries that actully power products. These batteries lasted a while too. They're also very good at powering anything that needs a battery. They also give off tiny electrical shocks if you touch the battery ends to your toungue. Hours of Football, Hours of protection, and tiny electric shocks. PRICELESS! 
I have this in my bedroom and I drift off to sleep every night to it. Its GREAT 
I never, ever thought I'd be writing a review of T.P., the white stuff kids use to wrap around trees on prank nights out on the town. (Do they still do that?) There was a time (many years ago) when I was too bashful to pick it up at the grocery store for my mother. But times have changed ... so on with my review: Scott tissue has long been a favorite of my family because it's tough enough to get the job done while still remaining soft and gentle. I like the fact that there's so many sheets on one roll which makes it last longer, meaniing fewer trips to the store. I can't see purchasing this through the mail, though, because it's too bulky. But it's a great product!!! 
I think the previous reviewer is dividing by 20 rather than 40 rolls (two 20 roll packs). I get a figure of approximately 80 cents per roll. With the $10.00 Amazon discount, the price drops to approximately 55 cents a roll 
While I DO love Scott Brand products...I don't think this package is such a great deal....this price works out to $1.60 per roll!! I thought buying in bulk was supposed to be cheaper?? You can buy a 4-pack for around $3.00, well, at least you can here in Florida! Total waste of money..unless it's necessary you buy in bulk. Maybe with the $20 off special it MAY be worth it? I'm in agreement with the fellow reviewers! Scott HAS changed (and don't you just hate when companies fix what isn't broke??) and their toilet paper now has a stiff,scratchy feel..guess that's why they came up with the Extra Soft version. And yes, it seems they WELD the start sheet to the roll now..I think they want you to use up half the roll just getting it started..to make you buy MORE and more frequently!! I think I'll pass on this "package deal"..I don't have money to FLUSH 
YES SCOTT'S IS THE MOST POPULAR BATHROOM TISSUE SINCE TIME BEGAN -- BUT  THE "BOUNTY" of Bathroom Tissue: BUT THIS STD. FORM IS A LITTLE ROUGH This "Scott Bathroom Tissue" is strong, very long lasting, and a terrific value. There is, however, one rub -- it is a little rough for this application, especially for frequent usage [which is why they recently introduced a "Scott's Extra Soft" product]. "Charmin Ultra" would be a better choice if you need extra softness and some store brands such as Kroger, Shop-Rite, and Wal-Mart's "Great Value" are comparable value-specific picks. Scott's has always been considered the "Gold Standard" for the bathroom, but its superiority has been challenged increasingly in recent years. If you still like this product, there is no reason to change. However if your needs now require a softer tissue, try "Scott's Extra Soft" or "Charmin Ultra". I have recently noticed as have other reviewers, that the glued end of the paper roll that must be pulled apart in order to start the roll seems very hard to detach. This seems to be a new phenomenon and leads me to believe that things have changed at Scott and not for the better. Maybe it is just a fluke. Maybe it is no big deal. And maybe the Scott Bathroom tissue isn't quite as good as it used to be. Maybe it is rougher and coarser than before. Just maybe. In the meantime, however, I am NOW using "Charmin Ultra" after 40 years of continuous Scott patronage. [I am not affiliated with any product or company.] 
This is not something I take pleasure in buying but it is important nonetheless. I have tried every brand out there. Scott, 1000 sheets has my vote. It has the necessary softness and is more than competitive in how long it lasts. The case pack is a convenient way to order. Now, I don't have to add bath tissue to my grocery list every week 
Hi I tried this product the taste was NOT TOO GOOD. But all the healthy stuff they crammed into such a little amount you have to drink is wonderful. Also on a positive note, my HAIR, after only a few days of drinking it, became INCREDIBLY soft!!! It was amazing. Good product, will buy again. WIsh they would come out with some new flavors though! Sa 
It would not taste good if you mix it just with water. I mix it with diluted apple or peach juice and it tastes O.K. The powder is loaded with lots of healthy supplements and I noticed it has a lot of B vitamines. I do not take it every day; I did not see noticable increase in energy. However, it makes it a light breakfast that still gives you good nutrients and protein 
I have been using this product regularly for a couple of years and am very pleased with it. I do notice a difference when I begin my healthy day with a Source of Life shake with fruit. Due to my job, I rarely get a lunch break on time (usually late) and a morning shake stabilizes my blood sugar and carries my through to lunch. Now several of my co-workers are using it as well. They were pleasantly surprised at the flavor compared to other health drinks. I mix it in a blender with bananas, sometimes mixed fruit, and lots of ice. I also add a good squirt of flaxseed oil. One co-worker likes it with banana, coconut milk, apricot nector and pineapple. I highly recommend it for a very broad spectrum of healthy nutrients in one good tasting drink 
This product is an excellent source of vitamins, minerals, soy protein, and whole foods concentrates. I take it in place of a daily megavitamin, mixing in fiber and whatever else I want to add. I try to drink this shake every day and I have for about the past 10 years. It's comparetively good tasting, too. 
I bought this product trying to get something that will complement my diet, give me energy the vitamins that I needed, and it ended up being great! The taste is very good it complements my smoothies giving them more body a great taste.I would recommend this to anybody looking for a good power shake that apart of tasting good is also good for your health. 
This is a great tasting protein powder. I usually put one to two scoops in some milk with ice, a banana, sometimes some blueberries, raspberries and mix it in the blender. The taste is fantastic! I like to drink this before I work out or right after. It does seem to give me a burst of energy. I highly recommend this product. 
I have been using the Source of Life energy shake for more than a decade. I can tell quite a difference in my energy levels. People accuse me of being hyperactive at work. This shake is delicious when mixed with a banana but still good on it's own. No chalky taste, no after taste. When I moved to Canada where it is not available, I gladly pay the shipping costs from America. Thank You Nature's Plus for a great product. 
Whether you are 25 or 55 this energy shake can make your day. My son was using the "Source" and about a year ago he got me using it. It's a great tasting shake that I make with orange juice, a banana and a couple scoops of the "Source" mixed with a hand blender. It is a finely granulated powder with a natural feel and look. No doubt, it has made a difference in my physical and mental performance. 
This is exactly what I wanted in my efforts to lose weight by portion control. It is lightweight, can fold up to the size of a medium-small-ish cutting board, and has an air temperature readout and clock. I found out this morning that I was short changing my husband in his protein amounts, and giving myself too much ounce weight in the "good" carbs. The platform is stable and the glass platform is detachable for washing. The action push buttons are a little flimsy but nothing to complain about = it works fine. Good value for the $$. 
Great digita scale... will give weights in grams or ounces and even has a temperature gauge and clock. Great item for the caorie counters 
Easy to use, space saving design. This scale is easy to calibrate. We use it everyday. 
My husband states: This cologne was very smooth when applying, and produced very little skin irritation, unlike other brands that I've used. The fragrance met my expectations of the Old Spice I've always known, AND the scent seemed to last longer than other colognes. I'd definitely recommend this to other family members and friends 
This stuff is an oldie but goody. I have cologne that has cost me a fortune. But this is still my favorite. Not bad for the price either 
Old Spice cologne smells great. I'll buy this cologne on a regular basis. It's very masculine and refreshing. The fragrance also blends well with my aftershave lotion. I like the fact that the bottle looks very different from other colognes. I'd certainly recommend it to my friends and family members 
My husband Test Drove this cologne. The cologne has a nice clean scent. Not really heavy, and according to my husband, ""manly."" The price is right. I like it much better than some of the overpriced designer colognes. My husband has sensitive skin and this cologne didn't cause any breakouts or irritation 
I remember this scent because my dad used to wear it when I was a little girl. I'm 43 years old -- so old that I remember when it was popular back then -- the first time! The cologne has a fresh, clean scent that I enjoy. My dad used it, my husband uses it, and I'm sure my boys will use it when they're old enough to shave. If it wasn't good, I don't think it would've been around all these years 
Works well, and its disposable batteries are a big plus. Tank is of adequate size. Nicely built and has held up well in extensive travel. Recommended 
I had this Panasonic portable irrigator for a little more than two months. The pump is failing and it is only a dribble now. Changed batteries but did not correct the problem. For the amount of money I paid, I could have walked into Longs Drug Store and bought an irrigator for the same amount or slightly more 
I purchased this Panasonic Oral Irrigator to take along when traveling. Since I have a prosthetic device in my lower jaw, I need to have a way of keeping the area clean. It was kind of hard lugging a regular sized water pik along when traveling. This portable unit worked great for me. It was easy to fill and handle, and the water pressure was sufficient to do the job. I would even consider using it at home daily. Very satisfied with this product. 
After the first use with the Panasonic Oral Irrigator my mouth felt refreshed! I used this before going to bed and my mouth still felt completely clean when I woke up. It is very powerfull, but the water doesn't last very long. The Panasonice Oral Irrigator can be compacted down and stored easily. Only downfall......this must be used in the shower or outside. It WILL MAKE A COMPLETE MESS. I will use mine in the shower from now on. My mirror got a nice bath afterwards 
I've been through 4 or 5 portable oral irrigators in the past ten years. The first ones I bought from Panasonic were quite weak and ceased to work within a year or so - changing the batteries didn't help! So I discarded them and went for a hand pump kind, but when that broke I went back to Panasonic - this model works better than their original model. The pulse is stronger, it's easy to fill, and hasn't died on me yet. So I'm hopeful it'll last more than a year! 
It works great, at home or on the road. Cleans well, no need for floss. It is better than floss because you don't dig into your gums 
The Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator works well in removing anything left behind after flossing, and seems it will clean any pockets in gums that flossing cannot reach. The only downside is that the two AA batteries do not seem to last long. Would recommend rechargables 
After 3 months of daily use, this nifty little device keeps on pumping! My wife wouldn't let me take over the tiny bathroom counter with a traditional counter-top style water irrigator. In addition to the space, the dangling cord would have been a pain. This portable Panasonic device tucks into my medicine cabinet. It takes 10 seconds to get ready and it works as well as the counter-top device. Yeah, okay, you have to change the batteries once a month. No big deal. It is small and portable and it works. Highly recommended! 
I like this oral irrigator. It doesn't hold much water (you have to fill it up at least two times during use), but it really does the job, it's easy to use and I can be quick about it. 
I believe I have a relatively healthy lifestyle so it is difficult to say that any one product made a difference. However, I take the Ultimate Defense along with their Ultimate Florazyme and the Ultimate Meal for 2 meals daily exactly per their directions; breakfast and lunch, and have been doing so for nearly a year now. I highly recommend them. This combination together is the best body fuel I have ever found. And, I have recommended these 3 products to a number of my friends and they too appreciate the quality and effectiveness of them 
I am very happy with the way these wipes perform. They seem gentle and they are very soft - almost like felt. The price was great and when you have babies in tow when shopping in physical stores you really appreciate having large/heavy things like this just appear at your door! The wipes container comes with an extra covering after you raise the hinged lid (presumably to help keep them from drying out) and My only complaint would be that when you pull a wipe through the little opening sometimes the "chain" of wipes fall back in and you have to take the whole top off to thread them back through the opening. 
Very gentle on my baby's skin and soft. They clean everything very efficiently. I love these wipes and don't understand why the other 2 reviews are so negative 
Beware: Pampers Sensitive Wipes are not the same as "Pampers Sensitive" -- the Pampers Sensitive Wipes contain citric acid, which can be an irritant, particularly for younger babies 
I have only used this a couple of times but works great. No problems. It maybe a little heavy for some and the numbers an the attatchments are a little hard to read but that aside it cuts great. It runs quiet and I found it easy to use having never done this myself before. Well worth the money. 
After using an old Wahl clipper for 10 years it was time to upgrade. This has been easy to use. We have already saved enough in the price of haircuts to cover the cost of the clipper set 
I bought this because I wanted to save money and found out along the way that I am able to do as good of a job cutting my own hair as the stylist and I save $15 each time. I also find that I keep it up more often because all it takes is 10 minutes and 5 minutes cleanup. Just to emphasize, I get great results cutting my OWN hair with no one else checking after me 
I like the Green Tea Diet pill for many reasons. First, it causes the bored eater (that'd be me) from eating aimlessly throughout the day. Secondly, since I've taken it for the 2 and half months that I have (actually this started happening within a few weeks and has continued), the capsules have helped shrink my stomach to probably half of what it used to be, so that when I do eat, I don't overdo it. Keep in mind that when I say stomach, I mean the one your food drops into, not your waistline. However, by no means am I saying that there's no weightless physically. There is! So far I've lost 15 pounds. Some of you might be thinking, "Well that's surely with exercise, and I'm not one to have time to do that, or I hate exercising." You know what? For those of you that DO exercise you'll lose even more weight than me at the 2.5 month mark, because I go about day to day doing general stuff, nothing like walking or jogging for miles or riding a bike. However, I've figured a few things are key to those that aren't too keen on exercise (the word alone makes me shudder). If you don't have time to exercise routinely or for very long, or you just hate the word "exercise" (I know it can cause terror within a few of us, don't lie) then keep these things in mind when you take this amazing pill: -Going to the grocery store? Don't go when you're hungry and don't park in the closest to the building spot (unless it's dark then it can be scary). For obvious reasons, don't go when you're hungry, you'll just end up popping everything into your cart (some stuff you don't even know what the heck it is when you get home to unpack). Instead, and I'm sure you know this, maybe go after dinner or after lunch. What to get? That's another few paragraphs down. -Going shopping? Does that word make you giddy with delight?...only until you realize you really don't have the money to be doing it? Alright, here's the solution. Go to the mall or outlet stores or wherever else it is you could spend hours looking around at stuff. Park in the furthest from the building spot, leave the tempting ways of payment either at home or in your car (hidden with stealth!), go in the building and window shop! Spend at least a half hour doing this to however long (though you'll get kicked out if you try to stay past closing time). If you think it's weird to exercise in the mall/store, it's really not. I know I've seen a few power walkers in my mall and it's totally obvious what they're doing, but the thing is you DON'T have to do that. Exercising this way is as easy as just browsing stores, circulating the mall, bypassing the food court (unless you need water) and checking out potential Christmas gifts while getting a regular workout! -Play with your kids for at least a half hour a day (outside)! Play hide and seek! Run after them! Shoot hoops (not only is it exercise, it's helping hand-eye coordination!), throw a few balls, kick a soccer ball, play on the swing set, walk around the park while your kids play! There's so many great activities and family bonding time you can do and get an easy workout, too! It's a win-win for both you and your kids. -No kids? Pets are the next best thing. I have three dogs and one cat. They're the sweetest, most evil things in the entire world! Not only do they make me take a run for my money (literally, cause they steal my shoes and anything else they can get and take outside) they also warm my heart and make me laugh and smile. 30 minutes playing with your pets is a another great way to help amplify the effects of this diet pill! -Have a good laugh. Find your funny friends, people, and laugh as much as you can! You lose loads of calories that way! There's definitely more small things that can help you lose weight, especially when taking this pill, but what about what food is right? Stay away from carbs. Period. They are not your friend all the time. Especially since they let lose all the things your fatty cells need to keep their greedy little lives prosperous in your thighs/stomach etc. Must have them? I know your pain. Instead start getting used to whole grain and wheat. Don't shrink in terror, it's not that bad! Eating habits, especially the bad ones need to be rethought when taking this pill for the best results! Well, that's my review, and a little of what I've done to help you get on your way to a better, happier, healthier you! I hope this has helped at least some people! This is how it worked for me, but keep in mind, every one's body is unique and special and has it's own way it likes losing weight, so just find that niche and you're good to go! GOOD LUCK!! 
I had a lingering cold / sore throat symptoms once a couple of years ago and I bought these in a healthy food store to try them out. Turns out they were just about the best lozenges I've ever tried. They work exceptionally, taste great and last a long time. Very soothing To be honest, I don't like the effervescent "Airborne". It's too inconvenient to use and too expensive. Too bad the store I went to stopped carrying these lozenges, because I won't buy the fizzy kind. Really glad I found them on Amazon, even with the shipping they're a good deal. Buy about 4 boxes, you'll need them and they last at least a year so no worries if you think they'll go bad. If you're a teacher or have kids trust me you'll need them even more. The only drawback I found to these is the foil packaging inside isn't resealable, though you can fold it over and they stay almost as fresh. And the lozenges are assorted fruit, but the packages I got were almost all 'grape' inside. I would prefer more cherry, orange, and lemon. But other than that, these rock. AND THEY DON'T SELL THESE AT TARGET, despite what you read in other reviews. Buy them 
Guess I did not realize the measurements where washcloth size, so I ended up ordering the mediums, perfect for a spin class at the gym! Other than that great product 
I ordered this product about a month ago, and since then have used it twice. So far, no complaints, can't ask for anything better for the price 
This product looks as good as it performs, which is great. I know and trust the Wahl name itself to make A high performance product and they acheive that here, the trimmer's are so light-weight you can use them anywhere with eas 
If it would be possible to give this product 0 or even below zero stars, I would. I tried to shorten my beard with the trimmer today and the only thing it did was to pluck out some hair and stop when more there were more than 4 hairs to cut at once. I did not even try the battery powered second option, because those are usually worse than the ones with an outlet. Anyway, I would never buy this product, because even $19 is too much for this 
Bought it because I'm traveling and I left my older Whal set at home. So far works perfectly fine, just like the other one I've got 
I can't complain about the quality or the features. For this price this is a steal. 
I have tried more expensives models of this brand, and they are better, but this looks and work pretty good for the price. the on/off switch its a little hard to move, but once you have practiced stop being a problem. So if you are not planning to spend a lot of money in a device like this, you should get this one 
Great price and does the job. Easy to use 
Well I don't think there is really much you can say about a clipper set, is there? I'm loyal to Wahls and this was a good deal. It shaves pretty well though I find I have to go back over areas a time or two to make sure I get it all the same length. I think it may have to do with the way the guard is and not a fault of the clipper itself. I've had it for maybe a month now and it has kept up well the four or so times I've shaved my head since. The little trimmer that comes with it is pretty nice and powerful for running on AA batteries. It trimmed down my facial hair and cleaned up my neck very fast when my old trimmer took some pressing and a few passes. I only have two minor complaints about the actual product itself. It gets really warm after 10-15 minutes. Normally this might not be a big deal but if you have a big head like I do and have to make sure you get it all done properly it can start to get too hot to want to use. The other thing is that it isn't too great for no guard shaving. Now granted I only tried it once but it wasn't catching everything when I did try. It could be that I was just holding it at the wrong angle to get it, which is easy to do in a mirror, but I thought it was worth noting just incase. I think it may need the guards to guide the hair in better. Also, something kind of odd and nasty, Amazon sent me an open used one. Now for $15 I wasn't going to bother returning it or complaining. I just cleaned it off with some alcohol wipes and got rid of the left over hair(Yuck!) and it was good to go but it really is worth stating because I think I would have got something else if I'd have known I would get a used one 
Having used Wahl's before I was looking at their product for my own set of clippers. My sister who cuts hair for a living suggested I purchase Wahl's as well. I got the clippers, and they already have paid for themselves double over I'm sure. Myself and a few buddies cut our hair on a weekly basis to stay proffesional looking. Clippers do a very good job on balding, as well as basic fades / high and tight cuts. The trimmer that is included is very nice as well, all though a little loud. But I certainly wouldn't think about getting a replacement for it unless it breaks. Over all I'm very happy with this purchase, and look forward to many haircuts with it 
I've had my 7850DLX toothbrush for about a month and I'm very happy with it. It cleans very well and is comfortable to use. When I used my manual brush I didn't spend the recommended time brushing. With this brush I know I'm doing it two minutes every time. It feels like a quality product and is a good balance of price and features. I like knowing I'm taking much better care of my teeth. With the price of dental care, this brush is a very good investment 
I've needed a new power toothbrush since my old one broke a couple months ago and knew I wanted another oral B. Loved my old one and I love my new one. The only thing I can do without is the 30 second beeps. My old one only beeped after 2 minutes which is sufficient 
I've hated the concept of using electronics to brush your teeth. I've always felt like it makes all of human-kind less capable of survival by needing a machine to brush teeth...I bought this for my wife, used it once and haven't been able to stop since 
This is the second Oral B electric brush I have owed. They do a good job of getting your teeth clean with very little effort. The first one I owned lasted almost 10 years. I prefer this type of electic brush over the inexpensive, battery operated ones you can purchase or the old manual way of brushing. It just gets your teeth cleaner. This one has the timer for each quadrant which is helpful 
This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever used, so I don't have any others to compare it to...but I love it! It is easy to use, nice looking and has a timing feature so that you can brush your teeth for the suggested 2 minutes. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good electric toothbrush 
This was one of the items included in a Baby Basket Outstanding for that New Mom and Baby!!!! 
This stuff does not work at all! I tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that didn't have negative feedback, save yourself money and do not buy this product. It looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lenses 
I wasn't too thrilled about spending this much money on a product I knew nothing about, but I'm glad I took the chance. Surprisingly, it works! And it doesn't leave a scar! It heats up the "spot" and in some cases, it's gone within 24hrs. I wish this was around when I was a teenager! It's easy to use and cute to carry in my purse. Try it for yourself 
I was skeptical of this product - especially at the price - however I am so pleased with its effectiveness. I rely on other reviewers remarks and so I am writing to tell you that it is definately worth the price. I can't believe how quickly it clears up a pimple. When I think of all the money I've spent on products over the years - and I'm in my 40s! I was tired of buying products that overdried my skin but left me with a red, angry looking spot. This product is truly amazing and works as effectively on mild acne. I only wish the Zeno was around when I was a teenager 
There are so many varied reviews for this product depending on which version you clicked on! Here's what I've found from mine: First, this is intended to work on adult acne, the occasional blemish. Sorry teens, this probably isn't the best choice for you unless you only have the occasional break-out. Second, this only works on NEW pimples so when you get it, don't expect the ones you currently have to suddenly disappear. It works best when you first notice a pimple appearing, especially in that just starting to get sore, slight red spot stage. That being sad, it does actually work, provided you keep the first two rules in mind! Two days after I received mine, I noticed that tell tale red spot beginning to form, I zapped it not only did it not get worse, by the next morning, it was completely gone! Plus, a portion of the pink version goes to Breast Cancer research if you buy it from the company (not sure about Amazon) there is a 30-Day Money Back Guarantee. All in all, a great product 
I had one of these food mills when my children were toddlers so I was very happy to find this for my grandchildren. It makes a great baby shower gift. 
I have used the mill with all 4 of my babies. I have found it to be a wonderful tool for feeding them fresh unprocessed and raw foods. It is wonderful. Pureed processed baby food is overrated and unnecessary. If you want to feed your little one the closest way to how God intended then get one of these! Well made, simple design and easy to clean (whats not to love?) Your baby really will be happy and so will you 
The food mill is very handy. I didn't bother using it with my first two kids (I'd received one as a hand-me-down from a friend). It seemed to be too much hassle. In fact, it's really simple. I use it daily with my third child and wish I'd experimented with it a few years ago. Our pediatrician encourages us to give our child what we eat, not to depend on Gerber or Beech Nut too much. The problem is that it's difficult to mash (with a spoon or fork) foods like banana, avocado, potato, small curd cottage cheese and other soft foods to the consistency that my child will eat (super smooth). This food grinder does that for you. It is really easy to clean and simple to tote around. I'll even mill several foods during one sitting, cleaning it between food types - it's that easy to take apart, clean and reassemble. In response to other reviews on this site, you can put cooked chicken into it, or crisp apple, but these won't become as smooth as yogurt. For that, you'd have to add water to the chicken, possibly add some other blending agent like potato, and use an electric blender. For apple or carrots, you'd need to cook it before you could put it into the mill and it would become smooth (like applesauce). Milling foods like corn and peas will probably result in some residual solid bits (the skin of the pea or kernel). To completely rid the food of that, you'd have to use a seive; even an electric blender would yield some solid bits. This product is probably most useful for children between the ages of 6 months and 1 year 
This works great at relieving anxiety. Whenever my husband feels nervous, he holds it to his head and it immediately calms him. It even stops his hands from trembling during an anxiety attack. He prefers the hair brush as it is portable, fitting in the glove compartment of the car, but both products work equally well 
If you've been battling acne all your life, this product will excite you as it clears your complexion. This simple device is portable and easy to use 
I really didn't think this thing was going to work...but when you have acne most of your life you will try anything at any cost. I have found that by using the Zeno in conjunction with Proactive Solution I have cleared my face significantly of acne. The Zeno product does take some time to use, as you have to hold it to the pimple for approx. two minutes. It causes redness on that area for about 10 minutes and is only mildly uncomfortable when you first put it on the pimple. After a day or two the acne is gone. It's weird, but it works! I only gave it 4 stars because of the two minutes you have to hold it on your face, the redness, and the mild discomfort from the heat. Other than that, it's quite easy to use and requires no clean up. You just have to charge it periodically and after 90 uses you have to replace the tip. Replacing it is so simple. You literally just pull the old one off and snap the new one on. This is a VERY simple device and it does the trick. It does not work very well at all on cystic ance, but for basic zits or pimples it takes care of them in a day or two. 
Item works great in conjuction with the Zeno. I love the Zeno, it has greatly reduced my blemishes better than any dermatologist prescribing medication to me could. The 90 tip may cost more but is a better value per tip. Easy to install. 
I bought this to curl my hair because it got great reviews on amazon. I tried it and it won't curl my hair AT ALL!! i can't even figure out how to pin the rollers to keep it rolled up. Either way i tried holding the round thing with my hair wrapped around it and nothing happens. Maybe i'm just not getting it lol. Got the chi iron instead and so worth it 
I always have trouble curling my hair, and when I do get my hair to curl it doesn't last very long. With these, the curls are soft, and lasted all day! Very easy to use, work well, a great buy 
These curlers are wonderful. Great for long hair. Fast. Takes out the frizz. I leave them in for 30 minutes with setting lotion and then when I remove them I use hair spray. I do not comb my hair. Only with a pick. Otherwise my curl would fall due to the length. After a few days, my hair straightens but the frizz does not come back 
I have tons of very fine wavy hair and smaller hot rollers make me look like an elderly poodle. I want them to smooth out the kinks, add some lift, and finish the ends, and these rollers do the trick. I've used this type of pin for years and so I didn't find them difficult to use - but they take a little practice. No pin marks, no fishhook ends, no frizz, no problem! Now I wish they made a set with even bigger rollers! How about 2", Conair 
Now I don't have to blow dry my hair and flat iron it. Works beautifully, however, there are not enough rollers. 
The product is great, but keep in mind that while some people complain that the rollers are too large, these are medium to me. I have long hair and would love some rollers that would allow me to add volume and curl under the ends without creating massive curls. I can't do that with these. They do add a sexy wave if I do it right, though 
I purchased this can to replace a "Simple Human" round 8 gallon trash can. The iTouchless had a slight problem upon arrival. The lid would only open half way when used in "automatic" mode. Went right to the returns section of Amazon.com and it was resolved with new can in hand by the NEXT day!!  This can works great, it holds a TON of stuff and it looks nice in a "country" kitchen. I find that the sensor is not overly sensitive. It is situated in a way that it faces up as opposed to down where it would pick up foot traffic and open. With two dogs, they do not set it off (medium sized dogs that are about 3 ft. tall).  Had some family over yesterday and they all admired it and had to try it out! Get one, you will not be sorry!  
I just received my iTouchless 22gal trashcan. There was a huge dent in the side above where the bottom shipping styrofoam ended. I was able to pop the dent back out and turn it so it faces the cabinet so hopefully nobody will see the two small dimples that remain. I tried a 33gallon trashbag which seems to have a nice fit - ample extra room. There is an inner ring which holds the trashbag in place so even if you put a small bag in that won't reach the bottom, it looks like you should be covered - at least up to like 10-20lbs probably. The auto-open mechanism works great, just put your trashcan in a spot away from passing traffic or you will probably wear your (4 D-type) batteries out quickly. It makes a bit of gear noise when it opens and closes but not too bad. I was surprised that it offered an AC adapter, that is great. I wish there had been an option when I ordered it to add one to my order, that would have even been better. I will probably head out to RadioShack and pick up one of those universal adapters - no problem. The other thing to think about would be using rechargeable batteries as well. Did I mention that it's huge? I guess I didn't really understand how big a 22gal trashcan was going to be. It's like as tall as the counters in the kitchen and probably about 12-15" in diameter. I think if you took a large pizza box and folded it in half, this thing would swallow it - no problem 
The Aquis hair turban very quickly dries medium length hair just the right amount to leave it damp enough for styling. I found that I prefer using this rather than the Aquis towels on my hair, as they tend to leave it too dry for my needs. The towels are great for drying off and drying wash and wear hair styles, but the hair turban is much better if you need your hair to be damp enough to set, blow out, or otherwise work with. 
This turban lives up to its promises! It absorbs moisture in seconds and hair is ready to style instantly. This is my second turban and I LOVE IT 
I love this turban. I used one every day for the last 7-8 years and it stayed in great shape. Unfortunately, I accidentally left it at a hotel, so now I'm ordering 2 more. The turban holds hair securely and dries it well, and is compact (takes almost no space in luggage -- convenient for frequent travelers) 
I wasn't so sure that this hair turban would work when I bought it, but after about 2 tries, I got really good at twisting the turban up and securing it with the button in back. This is great at absorbing the moisture in my(medium thick)hair. I will be buying another very soon 
Bought 12 of these several(9?) years ago for wife,daughter,sister,sisters-in-law,mother-in-law and nieces. I think 8 have survived. Everyone thinks I am Santa! and want new ones 
I love my Microfiber Bath Towel, so I thought that the hair turban would be a perfect compliment to it! I do like how it wraps up my long, thick hair (with room to spare), but I don't think it absorbs the moisture in my hair any more than a fluffy regular towel. Actually, it gets extremely soaked after just a few minutes in the towel. I wouldn't purchase this product again. Instead, I would buy another bath towel and use a hair clip to keep it up 
I think this product is alright for what it is advertised as and what the price you are paying for. I just wish you could get a one of these things that is as strong as the ones you find at amusement parks that really shake your feet up and give instant tingly sensations on your feet. With this you can get the tingly sensation on your feet but after you have your feet on it for a longer period of time 
This is just the miracle to give those achin' dogs a new lease on life! I should add that in spite of the "Ho" in "HoMedics," the AK-3 is strictly for feet 
We felt fortunate to find a product like the one we had been looking for, which we wanted to give as a gift to a friend but had not been able to find from local sources. We needed it for a certain date and were hoping that going to Amazon would get it for us in time. Not only did we find it and got it delivered in plenty of time, it was at a very good price and we were even more surprised and pleased with the "No charge shipping". All in all a very satisfying shopping experience. Thank you. 
After buying this, me and my partner started using it pretty regularily. It's a nice little machine that leaves you feeling it even after you've finished using it. Only downside is the amount of noise it makes while you have your feet on it 
I purchased this foot massager four years ago, when it was a slightly different looking machine. I placed it under my desk in my home office, and I've used it at least once weekly since then. I'm amazed it's still working, but it truly is! I've spilled a couple mochas on it, several cats have slept on it (one inadvertently turned it on mid-nap and got a big surprise), and I certainly haven't handled it with any sort of care. Yet, it continues to function beautifully, keeping my sore, arthritic, bunion-infested, little feet quite happy 
This is a good food bar. It has a green tint which I guess leads to the moniker "superfood." Not overly sweet but has a not so subtle hint of banana flavor. If you don't like bananas, I'd avoid this bar. Overall I like it and give it 5 stars 
excellent product. We built, with use in mind. As a health item, it fulfills its purpose of providing back massage 
I ordered this unit on February 7th. Every time I checked back on the status of the order, it read "not shipped" and the estimated shipping date got moved out. I really don't think this unit is avaialble from the company anytime soon. I cancelled the order. 
This site sucks, they do not have this product available and they still advertise it as if they are going to ship it. I ordered this Item in december and the ship date was Jan6 and now they are saying they will ship it in April this is really crazy who wants to wait that long, Amazon.com shud pull out this ad immediately its very much misleading dont even bother to order this item its waste of tim 
This thing smelled terrible. It worked fine, but it smelled like a skunk. It reeked so bad that it fouled up my whole living room. I had to eventually move it to another room and open the window and turn on a fan. Two days later it still smelled. I don't know if I got something from a bad batch or what. I even called Comfort Products to discuss the problem but they were unhelpful. I eventually returned this item to Amazon. If you have a keen sense of smell don't buy this product 
This multi-vitamin is different than all of the other multi-vitamins that I have ever used (even thoose purchased from GNC). This multi-vitamin doesn't give my stomach an ache, and seems to give me a nice "pick-me-up" in the morning. I take two of these a day even though the bottle says to only take one. I like Centrum's quality and i've never had any issues with this multi-vitamin like I have had to deal with in the past. The iron in this multi-vitamin doesn't seem to bother my system at all compared to similar vitamins that are somewhat unbearable to live with 
Was just as I expected it to be. Loads of fun for friends when they come home...It is quite relaxing too when u do it right. Cheer 
WHAT AN AWSOME EXPERIENCE. A TRUELY ECSTATIC EXPERIENCE FOR THE SCALP. A COMPLETE RELEASE OF TENSION. I LOVED IT AS WELL AS ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I PLAN ON GIVING MORE FOR CHRISTMAS 
I found exactly what I was looking for - a simple head massager. It doesn't break, and can be adjusted for any headsize. Glad I found it on amazon ;) Higly recommended 
I bought this for my wife, since she had mentioned a few times this year. It's wonderful. She loves it. I love it. We have no complaints about this scalp massager 
How can such a small massager do big things? The name, so appropriately given, creates goosebumps on your arms as it massages your head. We love to use the Tingler on our boys before they go to bed at night - it has a calming effect and helps go right off to La La Land. Who doesn't love to get their head massaged? To get the most out of it, definately have someone else use the Tingler on you vs. you doing it yourself. It's way more relaxing and you can focus on how incredible it feels. Try it, you'll like it 
Could not find this item locally so checked on line and was delighted to find it. Ordered several to give as gifts. Everyone loves them! 
I disagree with the earlier poster on this one... The tingler is *great*. My wife loves it! If it wasn't "tingly" then you probably need to invest a few minutes in adjusting the tines to be a bit looser. A definte "must buy" item in our book 
The Norelco Replacement Heads are great, but it was difficult to actually get them. After I placed my order I recieved some type of electronic cable/cord in an envelope with no paperwork whatsoever. The only tip off I had that it was a result of my amazon order was that the word "Norelco" was on the outer mailing label. I sent an email about this information, and they did reply, and I did get the Norelco blades, but again my order arrived with no paperwork whatsoever. Just the replacement heads in a bag. Great product and I like amazon.com, maybe there was just a problem with this particular vendor. 
I have been using Norelco Quadra action for over two years now. The replacement heads are even smoother than the original. 
I can't believe what a difference it makes to shop with Amazon. Here are exactly the same products that Norelco has for so much cheaper! They work great, too 
Great buy. Easy access. Didn't realize how much I needed these head until I tryied it. Excellent service 
The product came with clear instruction, which I followed easily. Based on the actual results the replacement heads perform far better not only those they replace but in my opinion also the original new heads. For the first time in over 35 years of shaving i can honestly admit that an electric shaver CAN shave as close as a blade 
I ordered this item as a gift. It was less expensive than other sites, and delivery was faster than I expected in spite of it being the holiday season 
I get a faster closer shave with the new razor replacemnt heads. Get some 
My husband says his Norelco shaver works like new with the HQ6 Quadra heads!! He is very happy with them! 
Almost bought another Norelco electric razor but decided to try the replacements heads first. Best decision, just like new and saved some money...... 
It's so easy to maintain my Norelco electric razor this way. The new heads made a definite difference in ease of shaving. However, after a few weeks, it mostly seems just the same old routine anyway 
The finer, softer bristles of badger hair do make a difference. The brush makes great lather, feels good on the face. I doubt a $50+ British brush is any better 
I use these types of brushes to clean my clipper and beard trimmer. They work much better than anything else I could find. I shave my head with a clipper and use this brush to clean it along with the hair around my ears and neck. I had an older plastic brush for like 10 years and it started to shed big time, so I needed a new one. As others have stated, a quality brush of this type is not cheap. I didn't do exhaustive research, but this does seem to be a really good deal. Anyway, I've used it a few times and it works well. The bristles are very soft when I use it to brush off hair around my ears and neck 
This brush is serviceable. I can soap it up and get the soap to my face with it. The quills are noticeably sharp which is a problem with less expensive brushes, but they don't fall out which is another problem with some less expensive ones. I had left my brush of many years behind at a hotel and was in a hurry to get a replacement -- it's the only way I've shaved for many years. Delivery on this one was fast, and I'm still using it. One can never be sure ordering another more expensive one online that it, too, won't have sharp quills *sigh 
For what it's worth, I also received NiMH 2500mAh batteries. They hold a charge very well and are working great in my Wii controller 
I can confirm, I ordered from this page and just received them in the mail today, and the batteries I received are 2500 mAh. 
these items arrived on time and as described. Rayovac rechargeabe batteries in the AA and AAA sizes have always worked great for me. They keep their first charge even longer than regular batteries so they sometimes outlast them before even needing a recharge. I wish the larger size rayovac rechargeables were as good performers as the AA and AAA. Don't forget to order the rayovac multi-size battery recharge 
I ordered these along with my rayovac battery rehcarger, They perform very well and are more affordable than other brands and they perform just as good. 
Ordered these last week - the product page said only 1800mAh but the price was good. The ones I received are marked 2500mAh though, so all the better 
pretty much I bought a charger for these batteries and ended up getting some batteries as well. overall they last long and the charger I have has a fast recharge time. 
I have no idea why other reviewers commented on the smell of the parts of this excerciser. It's made of steel except for the plastic pedals and rubber floor grippers (which work great by the way). The rubber grippers come in a seperate plastic bag, which, when opened, smelled a little bit like new rubber, but I don't think that's even a bad smell. Anyway, this thing is heavy enough and durable enough to replace an excercise bike. Let's face it, how many people buy excercise bikes and how many people don't use them after a short time. There is a tensioning knob that when tightened provides a harder pedal, but for now I'm using it more for the motion than the tension, so I think this thing is great 
I use this exerciser while watching movies on the couch at home with my hubby (Best not to do right after eating a big meal). I also have one at work under my desk for break times. It really helps get the circulation going in my legs - down to my toes - and has helped me lose weight and get my blood sugar down. Had cheaper ones, but they either moved around too much or broke at the soddering poin 
Recovering at home from a Stroke, I needed an exercise bike for both my arms and legs. Your exercise cycle fits the bill; it is strongly built, economical to purchase and provides the rehabilitation exercise I reguire 
The picture of this item as a plastic container labeled Lava Orange does not correspond to item offered for sale. A bar of Lava soap (solid) is offered for sale. A liquid form of Lava is not offered despite the picture implying otherwise. Lava as a soap or liquid is superior for its properties in cleaning off organic adhesives. So when you perform jobs where your hands or skin get dirty from adhesives involved in holding tiles in bathroom, grease from car, or adhesive applied to floor tiles, this product helps to clean it off whereas ordinary soap is not effective. Substances that are sticky, guey, greasy, and oily can be effectively cleaned through use of this product 
Lava has been known as the hand soap for men who got their hands dirty. It was a product originally marketed to coal miners and oil-rig workers since 1893. UNTIL RECENTLY. Ordinarily we use "Lava Heavy-Duty [pump-action] Hand Cleaner with Moisturizers, 7.5 fl oz", but when it runs out before we are going to the store, [we live 20 miles from any real shopping] we break out a bar of this stuff. The "Lava Heavy-Duty Hand Cleaner with Moisturizers" bar is much milder than the original bar product as the moisturizers really seem to lubricate our skin. We then avoid the abrasion we would be subjecting ourselves to had we just rubbed pumice soap against our faces. So we get the cleaning power of lava without the rough scraping, making this lava an excellent all-purpose soap. When we do get out to shop, we buy another lava pump with moisturizers and another bar or two of this stuff if we used our last and we are set for another month. 
I have thick curly hair that becomes a mess without a good product. I love bumble and bumble because it lets me work a small amount into damp hair after a shower and just forget about it. other products either weigh my hair down and make it look greasy, or don't do enough to tame the frizz. my local beauty supply shop doesn't carry it, so i didn't have time to go to a salon to pick some up when my last bottle ran out, and i tried some other well respected product lines as a replacement, and found that nothing works like the B curl creme! thank god for amazon, especially since the pricing is about $8-10 less than most salons that retail it! 
Best product I've ever found for taming my wavy/curly, fly-away hair, without having to straighten it. I can just put in a dollop after washing, blow-dry the roots and then let it be. Works in humid and dry conditions. For extra body, finger curl locks while wet 
I'm 32, and the only telling thing about my age are the serious wrinkles on my brow. I decided to try this as it wasn't too expensive (look at Strivectin - ouch!) and thought even a small improvement would be worth the price. I have to say, I'm shocked. After about two weeks, I saw noticeable changes, and it's now been about 6 weeks, and the improvement has been tremendous. The wrinkles on my forehead are almost gone. I'll definitely be purchasing more. Like some of the other reviews, there are areas this shouldn't go, like around the eyes. Be careful about that, as it created a little redness, not bad, but it really dried out my skin and caused flaking, which too about a week to clear up. Again, no problems anywhere else, but in sensitive areas like the eyes, it's potency was obvious, and these areas couldn't take it 
Looking good is more important to me than looking younger. As tempting as that sounds, I've always found it more exciting to be planning ahead for the future. For me, that means preparing today for tomorrow. I've always been a sun goddess, and when I read about RoC's 12 Week Challenge, I wanted to "fix my past". RoC Deep Wrinkle Night Cream is a light formula, so light in fact that I had my doubts. A little goes a long way, so one tube lasts a long time. I'm almost at the 6-week mark and have half a tube left. I don't know if I can claim that I look "10 Years Younger" but the change in my skin is noticeable. The texture of my skin is tighter. I didn't have many facial lines, but the ones I did have are much less pronounced. I'm a candy and sweet eater, and because I am really committed to improving my health and appearance, I've also cut back drastically on sugars and stepped up on exercise. But it's the RoC Cream that's really making the difference. It's something I do for myself. Try it - what have you go to lose? A few lines or wrinkles? Hmmmmm 
I must say that I was skeptical about this, but for the low price versus department store cosmetics, figured it was worth a try. Amazingly, it really works quite well and MY WIFE LOVES IT! After a few weeks, people were commenting that she looked less tired, asked if she had lost weight, been exercising or on vacation. Since it works gradually over a few weeks, you notice a bit of difference yourself, but the people who don't see you that often really notice a dramatic change. Smaller wrinkles are smoothed out and disappear completely, while large ones get smaller. It won't make a 69 year old look 20, but definitely takes off a decade of wear and tear 
I have had this hair dryer for at least two years, and I use it daily. I toss this dryer around and by no means baby it in any way. It has had no performance issues and has consistently done a great job quickly and effectively blow drying my hair. Previous to this dryer, I owned another Vidal Sassoon model. How much I loved that dryer is what led me to seek out the Vidal Sassoon brand again when I wanted to try an ionic dryer. I cannot speak to those who have had issues with defective ones, but my experience has been great with this dryer 
I have had an older model of this product for the last several years and loved it. It came time for a new one and I still love it. Can't say enough good things about it. 
I have been using this product for over tree years. Can't complain. Works excellent! Best choice for the price! 
I've had this hair dryer for two years and was pretty pleased with its performance. That is, I was pleased with it until yesterday. I was drying my hair as usual when it briefly stopped working and then huge sparks shot out of it! After flinging it across the room and unplugging it, I looked for the cause. The way the cord attaches to the unit is faulty and is easily damaged. This is poor design and could lead to some serious injuries. Please think twice before buying this dryer 
I use this in combination with the lavendar scented Seventh Generation laundry detergent and my clothes smell fantastically. I love all the Seventh Generation products I've tried and I love the price I get at amazon.com 
This Soy-based softener is a lovely alternative to most of the heavily scented products on the market. It is natural, softens your sheets and towels like a dream and makes you feel good and relaxed while folding the laundry. After using this product, you may find you need to use it much less than other fabric softeners. My sheets just don't wrinkle as much in the dryer anymore. I find myself using this product only when absolutely needed so it saves me money. It does make my towels super fluffy and I feel good about using a natural product. If you are in the mood, you could also add your own essential oils for a custom scent. ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
This fabric softener is totally adaquate. Clothes are not over soft and no static. However, the lavender scent does not transfer to the dried clothes - which is what I was hoping for. Overall, performance is better than if not equal to regular store bought brands and better for the environment 
I've had problems with deodorants--especially the anti-perspirants. They burned my poor underarms. I experimented and found that anything with aluminum chlorhydrate was a 'burner'. Non antiperspirants were OK. I started using those and I found out that the yellow pit stains on my shirts were undesirable by-products of anti-perspirant use, too. I switched back and forth between deodorants, until Old Spice came out with the High Endurance line. I scanned the list of ingredients and was happy to see no burning chemicals in the ingredient list. Ever since then, my pits have been happy and I smell like a civilized human. What more can you ask of a deodorant? 
This monitor was purchased as a replacement for a Mark of Fitness MF77 unit. The Mark of Fitness was, at best, an inferior product. If you didn't like the reading you could just re-test until you got the reading you wanted! Test varied from 105/50 to 145/80 at the same siting. The Prevention WS-820PV is consistant, accurate (compaired with a commercial cuff monitor) and of high quality. Highly reccomended 
I got two of these, 1 for myself and 1 for my 90 year old grandma, who hates things that are electronic or "technologically advanced". Both of us find it easy to set up, easy to use. Readings are accurate and display is easy to read. 
Easy to use. Quality construction. The position of the device on the wrist and relative to the heart is critical. Once the proper positioning is established and used consistently, this unit performs well 
I like the convenience of the wrist monitor. It allows me to monitor my blood pressure whenever I want to check / feel tense/ or in general, my blood pressure. I had it checked with my Dr.'s monitor and it was very accurate. 
I've been looking for a wrist blood pressure monitior for a while. I intended to buy the cheapest one but decided to go mid-range. The device is easy to use, and compact to store with its own case. Memory storage allows two people to store data, and also gives you an average. Data can easily be deleted if wanted and the price is reasonable. I like the convenience of monitoring my own blood pressure on a regular basis, as compared with getting it checked occasionally by a health care provider 
I would buy from this seller again and highly recommend! I received the wrist blood pressure monitor quicky and it was exactly as described. While wrist monitors are generally not considered as reliable as arm monitors, this one seems to be relatively reliable. I have used it frequently for more than a month and feel it is as good as an arm monitor and so far, reliable...It is easy to use, also; it keeps up to 30 readings and also measures pulse each time. So far, so good. 
Like all wrist monitors, it must be used carefully to get an accurate reading. It also tends to read a few points below an arm cuff when used as directed. Like all wrist cuffs, it is supposed to be held at heart, or armpit level. However, with me, that gives a consistently lower reading than an arm cuff... by a few points. To compensate I have to hold it lower down, by 8 to 12 inches. Then it is consistent with the arm cuffs I also use. It also tends to deflate a bit more quickly than I think is good for best accuracy. The big flaw, and one it shares with the Prevention DS-1902PV Arm cuff, is that while it claims to detect irreglar heartbeat, and does, it DOES NOT STORE that info in memory along with the BP pulse, time and date. If that info is useful to detect then it should be useful to record, and that is what I assumed it would do. I think that is a bit of misrepresentation of the product. I am also not happy with the way the information must be displayed for copying. It is a cumbersome system, and if you are not quick enough the display defaults and then that record, say number 24, must be found again, requiring another 24 button presses. Otherwise it does what it claims, and is a very handy portable unit 
I've had a monitor for a number of years that I strap on my upper arm. It's getting old, and I didn't trust it. My wife wouldn't use it because it required so much pressure on the arm that she didn't want to endure the pain. I haven't studied accuracy, etc., much. But, I've learned to use this one correctly and it is pain-free, QUICK!!!, and I get information I trust. Not bad for the GREAT price 
We gave this as a gift to friend of ours having a new baby. They had put it on their registry, and have told us they are very happy with the tools in the kit, and find the implements to be safe and effective for grooming their little one 
I love this set and it's a great price! My only problem is that I bought it for my 2 year old daughter who has long hair and the comb isn't strong enough for long thick hair. So I ended up getting her a new comb and giving this one to my baby 
If you buy them individually, they are less than $1. I know it seems silly, but I absolutely loe these nail clippers. They fit in my hand well, they stayed sharp enought to cut and not pull for a long time, and they are tiny enought for the littlest of nails. Even if you don't get this whole kit, buy Safest 1st nail clippers 
I didn't think too much of the matching nursery care kit, but this kit isn't too bad. Still, you could purchase all of these items seperately, although I doubt you'd save much money. The nail clippers are pretty good, but I've never used the scissors. It's just going to be personal preference which you're most comfortable with. At first, I thought the tiny emery boards were ridiculous, but now I find them indispensable. We'll see about the rest once we've got hair teeth to worry about. 
Excellent! Item arrived when it was promised. I am a very happy custome 
I have used everything in this so far, except for the tooth brush and my son is only two months old. After I use the nail clippers I file his nails so he wil not get this face. Sug, clip the babies nails while he is sleeping 
Have only used it for weight checking at this time. Seems to be accurate 
After I saw this scale advertised in Runner's World magazine, I set about finding one. I could not find it in the stores that the HoMedics website listed. Instead, I purchased it through Amazon. It arrived with the start button trapped in its slot and I was unable to even get it started. I was very disappointed with the marketing and the quality of this product. (Thanks to Amazon for letting me return it with a full refund and shipping costs. 
These scales work good unless you take a diurectic regularly. If so, it won't be able to give you the fat and water content 
I got this for my daughter as a surprise, she was so excited UNTIL she actually used it. It showed her at one weight, she stepped off of it and back on, and it showed another weight. Better yet, she lives in the dorms and took it upstairs and weighed up there and it showed an even different weight! Good grief. It also showed her at an acceptable weight, next then underweight, then the next overweight. So, needless to say after others trying it and getting the same errors, I returned it for my money back. Boo, hiss...can I give it a zero 
i love this scale. though it took a little time to program and figure out how the display worked, it has proved well worth the investment. it weighed a little off one day, but that is the only issue i've had with it, and could have somehow been user error. i'm not sure how accurate the body fat % is, but it is very precise 
I have never owned a scale that reads the same when you step on, off and back on again! Talk about accurate! It is very easy to program, too. This scale has helped motivate me to lose 15 lbs in 2 1/2 months! Sometimes I can see that I haven't lost weight, but have lost body fat and this is a huge motivation to keep going! 
This is the most consistent scale our family has used, down to the tenth of a pound. Using the body fat feature is a little complicated. Nice appearance 
Bought these for my hubby who loses glasses regularly. Although they sometimes catch on jacket collars, etc., the permanent tether has kept them safe from being sat on or left somewhere. And he likes their fit and look a lot 
put these glasses on and you'll wear them all day and not even be aware of it UNTIL you need them. Just separate them at the nose piece, pull them up to rest on the top of your ears and connect the nose piece again. Voila - you now have your glasses on. At the end of the day, just take them off and set them aside 
These glass are fantastic! When you are doing close work using both hands, you never have to re-position the glasses because they've moved or started to slide off your nose. I wear Tri-Focals and I need to use the very lower part of my glasses for close work. There is never enough "close magnification" or is the "focal position" raised high enough for me to look straight or upward through these lenses to adequately see. The CliC solved my problem! They are adjustable, durable, comfortable, VERY COOL looking, and everyone calls them my "CSI" glasses, and they all want them. Definitely a great purchase all the way around. I highly recommend them and plan to purchase additional CliCs 
My wife and I have five pair between us! I've given some to friends. They are so easy to ware you barely know they are there. Such a better idea than glasses on a sting. My dog kept getting caught in my glasses on a string and ruining the glasses. With the Clics theres no problem. I also took a pair by Vision for Less an they said they could put a perscription in the Clics if you need a special perscription. There the best an funny enough a great conversation piece 
Absolutely a fabulous invention that changed my outdoors life. Now whenever I travel my Clic Readers accompany me all the time. Light, resistant and extremely practical I grant its inventor the 5 start award for the most useful discovery in recent times 
These readers opened a new world for me.......a real conversation piece. As previous reviews have stated, you don't lose your glasses. My glasses arrived in time to take with me on vacation. But I was disappointed with the pictures taken of me.....hair around and above my ears stuck out. Consequently, I have ceased using them until I have my hair trimmed again. Otherwise, I have very pleased with them. 
My wife was always looking for a way to hang her reading glasses around her neck but does not like the croakies mostly because they cause the glasses to hang too low (and they tend to bump into things). I purchased the red "CliC" and she thinks they're great. They are also a conversation piece 
Perfect tips to get under the gumline. Finally, a product that does what it is supposed too 
This scale provides interesting information about your body fat. But, it is an estimate and a number of factors can alter the readings. Be realistic, it will provide good weight readings and body fat estimates. Just don't expect it to replace much more accurate pinch tests 
Being able to follow your body fat percentage over time while you're training and/or dieting is really useful; as they say: "what gets measured, gets managed." This is my second Tanita scale, and it's worth the extra money to have a model that saves your information. Unlike my first Tanita scale, I use this scale most every day, I think because it's so much more convenient when you don't have to re-input the values every time you use it. Interestingly, my two Tanita scales give exactly the same readings as one another, so there is some consistency between products. Also, Tanita customer service was very friendly, and sent me a replacement part for free when I had cracked the plastic cover on my old scale during a move 
The product was good. The only thing I don't like about it is there is no light behind the led readout. The black numbers are hard to read without a bright light. I was told my delivery date would be 5-7 business days, with a date of 1/27/6 noted on my invoice. I finally received the scale on 2/7/6. Checking on the reviews for Online Components there were several people who noted late delivery or not receiving their product at all from them 
These are great scales. They have been very helpful with our family of four tracking our weight and body fat. The hydration is nice too. I would definitely recommend these to anyone! Unlike many scales, you can get on this twice in a row and get the exact same reading. Very accurate!It's nice to see how many calories you can eat each day to maintain your weight. 
For a great shave and smooth skin, The Art of Shaving offers a superior product. This shaving cream is as good as Truefitt Hill, which is the only other shaving cream I have used, and is supposed to be the cream of the crop(pun intended.) If you look at the ingredients (formula) both companies use, they are basically the same, and listed in the same order. Of course, as with any of these shaving creams, to get the best shave possible you should use a quality brush. I use a premium grade badger brush. I initially used a silver tip badger brush that a friend lent me before I purchased mine, and found no noticeable difference. Regardless of whether or not you use a brush, I believe you will be very satisfied using this product 
This was a great price on this cologne. I paid half of what I would have paid at a local department store. I received it in a timely matter due to Amazon Prime. Great purchase 
Amazon has excellent customer service - I was really impressed by their returns system. Had a slight problem with my original order - Amazon rectified the situation promptly, and I am very pleased with the outcome. I won't hesitate to purchase items from them again. thank you Amazon Also the colonge smells awesome, I love it!!! and a great deal, too 
An excellent choice for office use. I would suggest this pen to everyone who is looking to buy a quality writing device for office use 
I love my HoMedic diffuser, esp. the gurgling brooke sounds, but after trying each of the four "aromatherapy" beads, I much prefer to use a round cosmetic cotton pad with a few drops of pure essential oils. The beads are kind of stinky, and though they claim to contain essential oils, any experienced nose will tell you that they definitely include synthetic fragrance oils, as well. If you want to fragrance your room, you'll do better with a candle or spray, but I would never use those things personally. Aromatherapy isn't based on fragrance. It's based on specific traits of specific plants and flowers, which are incredibly concentrated and potent in their distilled form. If the substance you're smelling isn't a pure essential oil, or is adulterated with synthetic perfumes, it's not therapy. It's just aroma. A good, inexpensive alternative is to pick up 2 or 3 pure EOs from your local health store. A good start- Lavender, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Lemon. Learn about the qualities of these oils, from a basic book or Google search, and experiment with a drop or two on a cotton pad in your diffuser. You'll enjoy the pure aroma and it will indeed be therapeutic 
My work demands a lot of interpersonal contact, face-to-face, over-the-phone, and written. Recently I have moved the more intimate of these communications off the electronic impersonality of email and onto quality stationery. At the same time, I've bought two fountain pens, my first ever, combining this polished chrome Cross Century II with its black-and-gold twin. One stays at the office and one by my writing desk here at home. In the mix, I find that I'm discovering a new art form and means of personal expression. Always an illegible writer, the stationery and the fine pen slow me down just enough to realize that I actually *can* write. It is difficult to overestimate the potency of a hand-written note in the Age of Email. It is a bit of chosen retro-referencing upon which the recipients of my letters comment with appreciation. And it doesn't take *that* much time. The Cross Century II can be considered near the top of the entry-level pens. I chose them because of good experience with Cross ballpoints, not wanting to spend too much until I figured out whether this was going to work, and my routinely bad experience with base-entry-level products. I believe this pen is likely to serve me for years to come. As I learn the beauty of a fine or solid stroke, however, I also widen my peripheral vision and discover there's a high-end pen store at my local shopping center. Uh-oh 
I surveyed the prices and felt this was a good price for a quality product. 
Ok...I hate to floss...........I was getting bad and worse reviews by my dentist..........pockets getting deeper, and warnings of expensive repairs ahead........dentist informed me he used Waterpik and his gums really responded.........Tried it.............INCREDIBLE improvement......a little messy with the water, but after a really good brushing, watching those impacted little food particles floating into the sink with the water spray keeps me using it......and no more worry about bleeding gums........so I use it about every other day 
This is a good product but it's ridiculous that you only receive one Jet Head! The one we had previously had came with three of them 
I purchased this unit to replace a 12 year old WaterPic. This unit is much quieter and it's design makes it much easier to clean and store. the rounded surfaces of the reservoir dry easier and protects the whole unit from dust when stored 
This has worked wonders for my dental care. Have to be careful what setting you use it on and the direction. It lifted my cap off. :-) Only problem is the need to make frequent solutions 
It broke shortly after a month or so. I called the manufacturer after six months. All they asked was the serial number and sent me a brand new one right away. It's a grat product to deep clean your gum. My dentist used to complain about my gum at every visit but stopped since I started to use this product everyday. I bought serval of this product. The first one worked for two years. This was my second. I bought another professional model for my son around the same time and it works well without a problem so far 
i have had horrible scales,but so many are sayin this one do not work, well i am here to say they are wrong. at least for me anyhow, it works VERY EFFICIENTLY, gives EVERY TIME I AM ON IT ACCURATE CLEAR READINGS OF MY WEIGHT LOSS, ETC. AND I AM GOIN TO CLEARLY RECOMMEND THIS GREAT SCALE, at this reasonably low price i say GO BUY IT! i even called customer service on the back on this conair ww scale,they are/were so friendly and helpful with how to use and how to set it etc. love it, have ABSOLUTELY NO COMPLAINTS!!! FIVE(5)Stars for sure! adios! [...] 
This thing is terrible and I am surprised that Weight Watchers put their name on it. Every time we step on it, the number changes. We have shown a gain of three pounds in a day, lost two pounds in a day, added three more pounds the next day and a gain of 7 in two days. All of this was by people who did not show these same results on other scales (including those at the local fitness club). 
This scale is pretty light but the reading has been very consistent and accurate, at least in my case. The reading is shown with big numbers that I don't have to bend down to read it. I also like the handle at the top which makes it easy for me to carry it around. 
Good scale nothing bad to say about it. Lite weight which is nice 
Purchased November 20th. Stopped working December 21st. Was used once a day. This is the last digital scale I will purchase; my next purchase will be mechanical. LATER: Replaced the battery and now it is working again. Two successive weighings will differ by as much as a pound 
EVERY time I stand on this scale, it gives a different reading. Today I'm looking for a new scale. I do NOT recommend this scale if you really want to know how much you weigh. It can be off by up to 5 lbs! 
I think the scale is great, except that depending on where you put your feet the weight could be off by a pound or two. FOr some people that might be their entire week of weightloss. So I suggest placing your feet in the same exact place each time you weight yourself. (Maybe make feet marks?? 
This scales works pretty good. As for the accuracy of the scale I couldn??t tell you, but I??m sure it is close enough, besides if you want an accurate weight of yourself go put yourself in water and measure the displacement. ?? It??s a good produc 
This scale is extremely accurate, easy to read, light weight and slim so it fits easily in a bathroom, bedroom, or kitchen. This is the best scale I have seen or bought for personal use 
I use this ink for daily work. It does not clog any pens I have used it in including Pelikan and Bexley 
It's ink. What more is there to say? It's just a lot of ink for a reasonable price, and if you like black ink, I highly recommend that you use this ink in your fountain pen. This package contains four glass bottles in individual boxes, each bottle being capped with a stout plastic lid with seal. And for those who may wonder if Cross ink will work with a Mont Blanc pen (hey, don't laugh, I can see it as a legitimate question if someone isn't familiar with fountain pens,) the answer--unless Mont Blanc pens are somehow special--is yes, since all fountain pens are just reservoirs with finely tuned leaks. A quality ink from a quality company will work in any of them. One thing to be aware of: if you've never used a fountain pen before, be aware that unlike other types of ink, fountain pen ink is not at all waterproof. At least, I've never seen waterproof fountain pen ink; I can imagine it clogging pens very effectively. Not that you should be taking your notebook to the swimming pool, but be aware that the ink will run if water touches the page it's written on 
This is the same as Pelikan 4001 Black or Brilliant Black ink. It is popular with fountain pen enthusiasts. It feels good during writing. It dries to a truly opaque, black color. It is not very water-resistant. It is not safe for writing checks 
Very well pleased! everything it stated is true. Would not go back to the old kitchen stink can again. So nice not to have to touch the lid,and go back to washing your hands to finish a project,because you forgot to use the foot peddle. The 17 gal.fits just as nicely in the same amount of space as our 10 gal. because of its designing the trash is easy to remove.And it is also a great novelty with people 
Overall, I'm very happy with this product. It adds an attractive, modern look to my kitchen and the larger capacity of the can adds the convenience of not needing to change the bag every other day. The automatic opener mechanism is a bit too sensitive -- the can often opens just by walking nearby -- but it pretty much works as described. I would recommend this product to others considering an automated trashcan 
If you don't want to spend an arm and a leg on the original, this is a great alternative. Works like a charm, stainless body. The lid is not silent when opening or closing and you need to use largeer bags with the 18 gal. but well worth it. Also does not come with the base or optional plug, (Not sure if the ones from the original will work - I didn't think they were worth the investment.)but the batteries last as stated!! great with kids and pets 
Loaded trash bag is easy to remove from can. Love the automatic lid...but the lid sensor is sensitive so don't walk to close cause the lid will open 
After purchasing the first one, we bought a second. Works as advertised and provides plenty of space for a lot of trash. No more emptying the trash can every other day to replace the bag 
Remington has made a great product. It does exactly what it advertises: trims beards and mustaches. The 10 adjustable settings can keep your beard looking long or short. And it effectively defines contours for beards. This is my first beard trimmer and I did not want to mess up all those weeks of beard growing by getting an inferior beard trimmer. The battery life is pretty good as far as I can tell. I haven't had to recharge it since I got it a couple of months ago. I think it is also a little more affordable than the other beard trimmers of its kind. Definitely recommen 
My beard is like a wire brush and shaving is like... well shaving a wire brush. Thus far I couldn't be happier I will buy these again 
I bought this trimmer after reading many favorable reviews about it. Previously I had been using a Remington PG-200 which was alright, but the attachments that it came with left much to be desired. The plastic pins that secured them to the timmer broke off and left them virtually useless. I am very happy with the MB-200, it's easy to use and clean. It does a good job of trimming my beard and doesn't give a choppy uneven cut like I was getting with the other trimmer. I highly recommend this trimmer. 
My old Remington MB-10 lasted a very long time. Must be something like 10-15 years. The motor finally died, so I needed a replacement. Found something from another brand at a discount department store for ten bucks. What a piece of junk that was. I returned that that day after I bought it. Just ordered the Remington MB-200 on Amazon. If the quality is as good as my old Remington beard trimmer, I expect to be very satisfied. 
A great product, I have nothing more then great words to say about this product 
the machine is sturdy, the battery life is incredible. excellent quality 
I was looking for a cheap trimmer for my beard, which I usually keep pretty short. I bought this without seeing it in a store. I think I had seen that it had good reviews here, and it was under thirty bucks, which I figured was a good limit for something that is only going to last so long. I didn't need anything fancy. I got exactly what I was looking for, but I'm surprised how well it works. There aren't any parts that seem like they'll fall apart, and it's got a great feel in the hand. I like the action on it a lot. My first trim was immediately better and much quicker then the previous trimmer I had (which had died on me). I think this is a great deal for someone who needs an occasional shave of a beard. I really like it. Nothing fancy but it gets the job done very well. I can't think of how it would be better 
The 5 blades are better than the Sensor 3 - but I do go back to the Sensor 3 blades when I run out of the Fusion 5 blades. It is worth it if you can get a good deal on the blades 
I've been very happy with the Mach III for the past few years --but then a Fusion razor and cartridge came in the mail and I figured I'd give it a try. I'm probably a good one to test razors... see my photograph--not only do I shave my face, (though I typically have a goatee), but I also shave my entire head as well. I've been using the same Fusion blade now --daily on my face, and just about every third day on my head-- and despite some claims to the contrary, it's still going strong... after almost three weeks!! Why has my blade lasted this long, despite my pretty heavy usage? EVERY time I shave, after thoroughly rinsing the blade, I GIVE IT A QUICK SPRAY WITH SHOWER CLEANER. (Such as "Clean Shower" or any of the no-wipe cleaners that you spray after using the shower.) Then I set the razor so it's standing with the cartridge end down. This does two things. The shower cleaner ensures that no film of water remains to dry on the edges of the blades, leaving spots for microscopic rusty areas to form,) and standing the razor blade-side-down makes sure that gravity takes any debris or water that MIGHT be left on the blade, DOWN and AWAY from the blade edge, since the edge of the blades face UP when you have the cartridge down. Prior to doing this on the Mach III blades, I'd also get about 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade... but once I tried it, I got as many as 30. It makes a HUGE difference! I should also point out that I almost never get nicks and cuts. (I've been shaving my head for about 4 years, and I think I've nicked it shaving ONCE... .part of the reason is because I'm very careful about using my blade-cleaning technique.) Note to Gillette... Send me a lifetime supply of Fusion cartridges and I'll consider removing the blade-life extending tip from this review! ;-) - Jonathan Sabi 
Like others have said, the cartridges are way too expensive and wear out much faster than they should. But for the first time since I started shaving almost 20 years ago, I can finally say I've found a comfortable shave. I've been using Gillette products for several years now, always switching to the latest product. Each one improved on the comfort over the prior, with the possible exception of the "power" versions over their "manual" counterparts. But until now, I was never completely satisfied. Now I just have to wait for the next product so they'll hopefully lower the prices on the Fusion replacement cartridges 
A Work of Art and the best shave I've ever had! I laughed when I heard Gillette was coming out with a razor with 5 blades but it didn't surprise me. This is the best shave I have ever had. The 5 blades glide across the face without friction or burn and the shave feels effortless. The 6th single blade is gimmicky but good for what it is for...under the nose and sideburns. I cringed when I saw the cost of replacement blades but buy your blades on EBAY and save lots of money. I bought 64 Gillette Fusion blades on Ebay for about $85. 
If you suffer from folliculitis, this may just be the razor you were waiting for! I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating. Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion! Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven't noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion's blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the "hinge" farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved! Also, before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren't ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don't hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it. In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor 
This item is not worth the money spent on it. You can not use boiling water and the steam does not last any time at all. You do better heating water in a cup in the microwave and breathing that steam. You can put the Vicks strips or whatever in your cup of water. This is not a good product in my books. Thanks 
This is not as big as it looks in the picture. It is tiny! You have to heat up the water yourself separately and then pour it into this piece of junk. There is no electric heating. Stay away from this 
I would have given it a negative star. This is not an electronic device and it cannot use boiling water. I agree with the previous comment that by putting boiling water in a cup will produce more steam than this device 
How worthless? Let me count the ways, unless you are a child, the fit does not fit. This is not an electrical device and you are only allowed to use hot tap water, about a cup's worth, so there is no steam. Save yourself a bit of money and have a hot cup of tea, it will surely produce more steam than this ill-conceived gizmo 
I purchased this item for my Mom, who suffers from chronic bronchitis; it seems to have had the desired effect of loosening chest congestion. I should add that I purchased this Vicks product after it was heartily recommended by a friend who owns one - and who happens to be a nurse 
ws delevered as promised and pillow was ok but doesnt keep its shape to long but what can you say could be made to keep shape bette 
The price of this product is a lot better than what you can find at the store or salon. Very happy with my purchase 
This was a gift for my husband who suffers from sinus headaches. It really has helped and he is very happy with it 
The fragrance is very fresh and light. It has a floral base with a light overtone of cucumber or melon which make it airy and refreshing without making the wearer smell like a "fruit salad." It seems to me, however, a perfume that speaks more of a younger person than I am; or perhaps a more youthful fragrance than I usually wear. I tend to prefer deeper sents with overtones of sandlewood or other woody scents. Would make an especially nice gift for a teen or 20-something 
Terrific product for a great price! The shipping was outstanding and very prompt. It sure beat fighting the crowds and the traffic 
Cool Water is the perfect fragrance to wear in the summer heat. The scent is clean and refreshing, not overpowering. I've used it for years 
The product arrived here fast and in perfect condition. Not to mention how wonderful it smells 
Fantastic BACK BRUSH - along with the Loofa Brush, I now have the most beautifully clean back in the USA!! Needs to be somewhat more STIFFER..... Otherwise - just marvelous! 
When dry, it feels like it'd be rough on your skin - pretty much like a regular loofah does. Once wet though, it's great, just abrasive enough to clean but not harsh enough to be uncomfortable. I love it 
I just touched this brush with my fingers and thought "how could anyone use this to bathe with?" 
ed600 said "This shaver may last you a few months - a year, 2 to 3 years will be a stretch." Well, I disagree. I've been using nothing but my Remington ms3 2700 every day for SEVEN years. I clean the unit very quickly after every use and purchase replacement foils when necessary (about every 2 years). I just bought my second Remington ms3 2700 after an internal plastic part broke due to rigorous cleaning. This unit isn't perfect, but nothing is. (And by "clean very quickly" I mean that I open the top and let the little hairs fall out. 
I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas, by the end of February the screen had visible holes in it and drew blood. The shaving took forever. But for the price I expect it to last more than 2 months 
I've had Remington's before and I must say this is not their best product. It can be found cheaper if you must have it but I also have used Braun's before and is a superior product although much more expensive. I have tried many different methods of shaving but this razor still burns my face everyday no matter what i do. I have not had any problem with battery charge as some have talked about 
Arrived on time. Met all my expectations -- it's a great shaver. Price was very reasonable 
I'll keep it short to the point: this is the best shaver I've ever used. I have a thick, heavy beard that grows long quickly AND I have sensitive skin. I am recovering from surgery and needed a shaver that gave me a decent shave without a long adjustment period (because I am unable to manipulate a blade-type razor). This thing absolutely blew me away the FIRST TIME and every time I've used it since. I am 42 yrs. old and couldn't imagine getting a shave like this. It could be the era I grew up in and it HAS been a long time since I've tried an electric razor, but this thing is GREAT. Make sure you follow the instructions and I'm pretty sure you'll have good results.  1. Keep the shaver clean and lubricated (it doesn't hurt to do the same with your face and neck). 2. Use the trimmer for longer beard hairs (face neck); pull your skin flat and use a semi-circular stroke. DO NOT press down harder to get hairs that prove difficult to trim or shave; rather, use the method stated previously. And, oh yeah: I haven't had a problem with the indicator light. I haven't noticed it and it doesn't affect functioality. In my opinion, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread 
I have used Remmington shavers for over 30 years and this one is the best. It has an annoying characteristic, however, of showing the red charge light being on even when there are 4-5 more shaves left. Otherwise, it is as advertised and an excellent product 
and I don't own the company!!:) I use it a number of times a week, and it does wonders for my posture. I spend the overwhelming majority of my time at the computer, and this undoes the damage to a great extent 
I had a herniated disc in my L4 and L5 about 2 1/2 years ago. Im my laziness, I never stayed with my exercises, and I opted not to get back surgery. Fast Forward to today, and I still have back pain. I wanted to try some products to get me started towards a healthy back again, and this really works. It works by stretching your back. Thats it. Nothing fancy, no instant pain relief, it just stretches the tight back. Over a few days, my back pain started to get better. If I laxed in my using, the pain would start to get worse, so I would start stretching again, and my pain got better. That's it, but it works. I love it for the relief I get 
I have been using this product daily for a month now and it does help my back. It loosens up the fixations in my back and allows more freedom of motion without pain. I see a chiropractor once a week and even he has noticed a positive difference. In addition, working out at the gym and using this Lumbar Extender has helped me feel years younger. It is expensive for two pieces of plastic but you can't put a price on your health 
Rather pricey for what I got. i think I could do the same thing with towels 
If you sit at a desk for all day at work you spine takes a toll on you upper and lower back. I use it everyday when I get home from work. It is very realaxing feeling have all the muscles in your back stretch. It think it may also be helping with my bad posture from sitting at a desk all day. Fantastic Product 
A lot of bucks for a piece of plastic but if you use it it works and is worth the price. Like all exercise devices its too easy to set and forget and wish you had saved the money (for what? expensive therapy or chiropractors? 
from the photos it looks like it has sharp edges or something...it doesnt, and it is effective at what its meant to do. However, once in a while a hair will be to thick, or it'll grab too many, so go slow or you can accidentally pull hairs out from the root 
Seems to do a pretty good job. Gives more control than with the battery operated clippers. Also, less likely to pull hairs than some battery operated numbers. 
You dont have any options when buying heads for your Norelco. None the less, the heads work great, the price is fair, and as often as you may have to replace them, $20 or so isnt that much for a good shave 
I order these yearly for my husband. This is the best price I have found, and they were free shipping eligible. Can't beat that 
This is the best razor heads, especially for hot and humid climates, such we have in Brazil. 
Maybe some people got a bad batch of this laundry detergent- I ordered a case, and every bottle has been fine. They all have the no-drip cap and the consistency is just like any liquid detergent. This product has worked great for my family, which, by the way, includes three teenaged boys who really know how to make clothes dirty. I would definitely buy this product again 
My local kroger is selling this item at $3.88 per bottle (if you use your reward card - which is free to anyone who wants it) - do the math. The amazon price is a rip off. 
We have a high efficiency washer so we use half a cap of this product and our wash comes out great. I also love the fragrance free of the free clear. This is my 2nd purchace of 9 bottles 
This stuff is AWFUL - it goops up inside the bottle and won't pour out. I had to mix water with it just to get it out of the bottle! I only do a few washes a week, but STILL, it shouldn't have gelled up like that so fast. In fact, it should never gel up at all. I'll never buy any of the ALL Small Mighty products again! What a waste!!! Rated 1 star because there is no ZERO star rating 
These things are great! I carry one all the time and my friends often count on it 
I love this product. I find it takes out almost any fresh food stain. It's already saved several favorite items of clothing from the trash bin. It does take a bit of rubbing with the absorbent tip to remove tomato based stains, but remove them it does. I think those folks who have been disatisfied don't get that the tip is the key 
I first used a Tide pen (aka Tide to Go) when I spilt soda pop on my white (of course!) shirt. My best friend gave me her pen to use, several hours later, and the stains disappeared. I just used it on bbq sauce on my shirt, no sauce left! BEST YET: I used it on a well set-in, multi-laundered stain on a sweater. The stain is barely noticeable. This is on my VERY short list of products I cannot live without 
I am a skeptic by nature. As someone with a degree in business I expect marketers to stretch the truth, at a minimum. I purchased this product thinking if it didn't work it was only few dollars. The guys at work were as skeptical as I was until the first coffee spill. This little pen even removed a coffee stain that was 4 hours old. We were all absolutely amazed! I have used this product on the following stains and it removed them completely: 1. fresh coffee stain 2. 4 hour old coffee stain 3. balsamic vinegar 4. make up (foundation) 5. marinara sauce 6. olive oil 7. soy sauce If you or your significant other are spill prone, pick one of these up right away. I have one in desk and another one in my purse. I knew Tide had a winner when the guys at work began purchasing their own Tide to go pens after using mine. I can not recommend this product highly enough. It is actually one of those products that does everything that it claims. 
Everyone elses' rave reviews on this product were quite impressive, so I decided to give it a try. I would not have believed it unless I tried, and IT WORKED! But don't take my word for it - try it and SEE for yourself! Remember, works wonders on "FRESH" stains. Don't let the stain sit on clothes too long 
we used the product for the first time at dinner - spilled some food on myself, and since I carry the product in my handbag, I used it and it worked immediately. So far my experience with Tide to Go has been very positive 
I have used the Chocolate PowerBar from a grocery and think it is a great product: highly recommended. The carton of them I got through the mail are basically OK, but seem to be slightly stale, a problem not encountered with the grocery-store purchases 
This is a reasonably good enough power bar for those times when you can't eat a real meal. Good texture and satisfying 
I've tried many protein bars but this is the only one that i like for extra energy and sometimes as my cookie/sweet. The downfall of this bar is that it gets really sweet and having too many in one day or in one week can really get you sick of the bar and you wouldn't want to eat it anymore. Other than that this is the only bar that doesn't just have chocolate or peanut butter flavoring, which makes it unique at the same time not taste like a protein bar 
Very addictive. I'm surprised at how much I love this one. And yes, the previous reviewer is right, it gives you the full sensation, which is great so I can skip a meal or two after I eat it 
Protein Bar, Vanilla Yogurt is my favourite energy bar. I eat it after a workout or a run. It tastes good, it takes time to eat (which is good!) and gives a fullness sensation. I particularly like the high protein concentration as opposed to other bars that have more of a carbohyrates emphasis. The pack of 12 lasts me two to four weeks and is a good bang for the buck 
These energy bars are excellent. They taste great and really give me a boost when I am cycling and are a great protein snack after a good workout. The Cookies and Cream flavor is my favorite so far. I would recommend that you drink plenty of water when eating one of these bars 
I eat a power bar protein plus every morning before I row. I've got a 20 minute commute to the boathouse and the power bar along with a jug of water and I am ready for an intense work out. Additionally, I eat these as an alternative to a cookie or some other high fat, high carb snack during the day. These bars taste good, are packed with the right stuff and get you over those cravings and down points that we all experience from time to time. Grab a box and keep them on hand, you'll be happy you've got them nearby when your hungry. Highly recommend this product 
I am a power bar addict and I absolutely LOVE this one... However, the vanilla flavor adds to (rather than takes away from...) the typically "cardboard" flavor of a Power Bar. Oddly enough, this doesn't bother me! The vanilla is so sweet (and I am an admitted sugar addict) that it really does control that need for snacking. I usually split the bar... one half before my workout and one half after. I do agree that you MUST have water with one of these bars. It will sit like a ton of bricks in your stomach without the water. All in all, this bar is great. I can easily get through a long day or a tough workout with one of these 
These are great reading glasses. I'll be down to a couple of pairs of these from the current 8 pairs of regular reading glasses. Here's my list of positives and negatives. Plusses: (1) Freak out all your friends when you pull them apart for the first time. (2) Very convenient - I always have them when I want them. (3) Fit comfortably, easy to adjust. (4) No more "hair grease" on the inside of the lenses. I don't have to clean them all the time. (5) No more glasses falling on the ground (from the top of my head) when I bend over. (6) Great geek glasses! Negatives (all minor): (1) If your hair is slightly over you ears, you might need to "tweak" them occasionally when putting them on your face (I'm thinking I need a haircut). (2) When reading in a kicked-back recliner, they have a tendency to be pushed out from your nose a bit (I don't read in the recliner that much anyway). (3) You may get annoyed at first trying to find them - when they're hanging around your neck! (4) Don't get the clear frames if you're going to use them in a bright fluorescent light setting - too much glare. (5) Great geek glasses! Thanks CliC 
This product is wonderful. I could have sold at least 100 pairs when I went out this evening. Everyone I met had never seen these before. They are a great hit. I tutor three days a week - in a boy's prison, an elementary school, and a private child; they all thought that these glasses were the most amazing, awesome invention. Thank you CliC. Sincerely, Karen Guria 
These are terrific ! This is my 2nd pair and their design is excellent. No more losing your reading glasses. No more buying cheap glasses and having to keep them all over the house or leaving them somewhere. Anyone who needs reading glasses needs a pair of CLICS! An added benefit is just watching your people gawk in amazement as you raise your CLICs to your eyes when you need them and they see how they are magnetized together !!! HAH 
.... which is every 10 or 15 minutes right. I've tried chains, they tangle in everything. I tried prescription bifocals, I could not get used to them, particularly walking down stairs. I tried another prescription pair, framless, light weight, pushed down the nose and meant to be worn all the time. Didn't work for me, I'm just not comfortable in glasses unless I'm reading. "Don't put them on a chair they'll get bent" -- he was right, now they need to go back for repairs. But they won't because I'm finding these I wear all the time. They're around my neck when I need them. Adjustable, so if I'm leaning back relaxing against a pillow they don't pop out and off my nose. I really am in love with these glasses, short of having my youthful eyes back this is the next best solution 
First rate optics in a frame that is tolerant of crushing accidents by virtue of design. Then again, since you can hang it on your neck, it is always handy and out of harms way 
[...]I have a big head, I can never wear baseball caps, but they fit fine, both ways. I have easily gotten in the habit of clicking them together and the dropping them down to my neck. It freaks people out all the time, which is pretty funny! I only wear them at work, because the size makes them not very portable, you can't keep them in your purse. The only thing that really bothers me about them, is that they get smudged easily because I touch them all the time to open and close. Also, admitedly, they are a little dorky and and hard to wear with a pony tail. I usually slide them under my hair, it is more comfortable. But, all in all, I love Clics. The very best thing about them is that I don't put my glasses on top of my head anymore. I hate the way they would always get tangled in my hair and I had to rip them out! Ouch! 
I had ordered these for me previously, they're really confortable, these I ordered for my sister in law and she liked them also, thanks for the great service and product 
My husband had fifteen pairs of reading glasses all over our house, our cars, and around his computer. Now, he can wear the ones I purchased and not lose them but still look manly without the lovely chains offered in the past. Great product 
I want more. I want sunglasses (I've checked; they have them) and sunglasses with the reading magnification included (if they do). They're not perfect, a little crooked, and given the plastic one-piece construction no molding to the individual head is possible, but that is a minor gripe and overall I love them. Have caught myself slipping a pair of the OLD reading specs on when the CliCs are around my neck. Proof that they are v. comfortable and can be forgotten! I'll be picking some up as gifts for eye-weary friends 
One of the best sprays in recent times. Can be used both when dressed Foraml or Casual 
I had one Satinelle Epilator with a massager and I loved it, but the batery died, and I decide to look for a new one, with more tecnology. I found Satinelle Ice Epilator and it's better than my old one! It's faster, painless and takes off even the really small hair! I always love it, now more 
I HATE HATE shaving my legs, seems I was doing this everyday!!!! By the end of the same day I was "prickly". I originally saw this item on QVC and wanted it (thought the Ice idea was a good one), but was fearful of the PAIN I had heard it caused. The first time I used it, it was a bit rough but now several times later I don't even blink.And I have not used the Ice part since the first use. The hair grows back thinner and I have even recently attempted to slowly introduce the bikini line! Great purchase 
I bought it as a present and it works fine. The only down note is that it does NOT work on a battery, only pluged-in 
I like this product. The hair has started growing back much slower, although I still shave sometimes after I epilate. Good product. 
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL WOMEN!!! I'VE HAD PROBLEMS EVER SINCE I STARTED SHAVING, EACH TIME I WOULD SHAVE I'D END UP WITH PORCUPINE LEGS A FEW HOURS LATER....I DIDN'T EVEN WANT MY HUSBAND TO GET CLOSE TO ME ~ MY LEGS WERE ALWAYS ITCHY AND IT WAS TOO THE POINT THAT I COULDN'T STAND IT ANYMORE. LASER HAIR REMOVAL IS NOT AN OPTION RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! I BOUGHT THIS AND THOUGHT WHAT DO I HAVE TO LOSE? WELL, WOMEN I AM TELLING YOU ITS THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME. I RECIEVED IT 2 WEEKS AGO AND STARTED TO USE IT RIGHT AWAY, IT DID HURT THE FIRST TIME, BUT TODAY (THE SECOND TIME)I'VE USED IT FELT MUCH BETTER AND THE HAIRS WERE A LOT THINNER, THIS IS AMAZING! DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT IT NOW!!!! 
It is a very good product but the ice does not decreases the pain. So you can buy the model less expensive. It is very nice for the legs and underarms, but not for the bikini. 
I am using an epilator for the first time . Did not feel any discomfort and the ice cooler works excellent. Does quick work and if you keep the skin tight, there is hardly any pain. This is a value for money product. 
I had a previous Satinelle Epilator for many years and have been very satisfied with the results. When I broke mine, I showed my loyalty by purchasing another. This model is a little different from the original, but the results are still great. As I have used an epilator for years, I don't feel the need for the cold pack, but I'm sure it would benefit a new user 
I am extremely pleased with this product. Understand two things: that I am moving up to an electric epilator from sugaring, and I don't have overly heavy hair growth. It works very well, even on underarms which sugaring was useless for. I do agree with one reviewer that folds can be tricky, but stretching the skin helps. I didn't find the ice feature all that important, but then I had sugared before so I was familiar with the stinging (yes it does sting). I definitely have used the product for much more than 15 minutes and have had no motor problem, but I have only owned it for a couple of weeks so I can not speak about long-term durability. I would hope that the person with motor trouble trimmed any really long hair(such as in the bikini area and beyond if you are a first time user) before using because several machines recommend this however the directions for using the satinelle ice are a six panel wordless cartoon that left me scratching my head wondering "is this a joke?" Especially when the warnings and cleaning instructions are a multi-page, mult-language extremely clear instruction booklet: one quibble for an otherwise great product. There may be better a better epilator out there so read the other reviews. I thought the ice would be a better thing than it was, but then I was used to the stinging from sugaring - if you have never epilated, waxed or sugared - you may find it very important. I liked the narrowness of it for the bikini line and handling. I do wish it had a light like some other models have. Still, I am very pleased with my purchase 
Shaver does an excellent job, considering it is battery operated and made for travel. I keep one in the car and one in the overnight bag. I like the fact that the blade and foil are replacable 
Alka-seltzer morning relief is a God-send on Saturday and Sunday mornings 
My dad actually introduced me to this stuff when I was in college, and I am really happy for that. This stuff is incredible in getting rid of headaches and a little boost of energy when you are hungover. The only downfall for some people is whether or not they can stomach it, because you have to drink it pretty quickly. But if you don't mind that, then you are in luck. It works INSTANTLY too!! My only problem now is that I am possibly taking it for granted in that I take it if I even have a slight hangover, when in the past I probably wouldn't use it. But that just shows how well it works. ***ALERT*** It appears this product may not be sold in stores anymore. I've seen it pulled off shelves at many drugstores and supermarkets, so you may only find it online now. I don't know why, it probably wasn't selling that well. Maybe it isn't that well known yet. My advice....GET IT WHILE YOU CAN!!! It should be a fixture in your medicine cabinet 
Alka-Seltzer Morning Relief is great! If you have a hangover it does the job or even if you just need a pick me up from lack of sleep 
This is a staple that I cannot recommend enough. It is amazing for morning hangovers...it's also a very nice upper before an evening begins. I was recently sick with the flu and had to go out for a dinner: the aspirin numbed the throat pain while the caffiene gave me the boost I needed to be attentive during dinner. For anyone that parties heavy or simply has the occasional rough morning, this is a great product that is near IMPOSSIBLE to find in local drugstores. You have to plan ahead. And in regards to the taste: I think the taste is much better than the regular alka-seltzer and find it refreshing in that 'this is going to make me feel much better' way 
It really smooths over your hangover so you can get on with your day. The caffiene is the added twist to this Alka Seltzer product, plus it tastes better, and easier to go down... I highly recommend it 
NOTHING WORKS AS GOOD AS MORNING RELIEF.....It is as crucial as aspirin or bandaids, everyone should have some... 
After a night out drinking (a red-eye flight or a never-ending business meeting), Alka Seltzer's Morning Relief is a MUST-have. Whenever I wake up with a heavy head, achey muscles, and hollow "I can't believe I polished off a bottle of red wine" feeling, I turn to this stuff for immediate relief. Within minutes of taking a dose of this fizzly, citrusy goodness, I'm back on my feet ready to go! AND it's not just good for hangovers! I bring this stuff with me on business trips when I find myself on a trade-show floor for long hours and having to get up at 5 am after a business meeting that got out only a couple hours before... To stay alert and ready to face another long day, I reach for my Morning Relief! Booze bags and workaholics rejoice! This stuff is great 
This stuff tastes vile, but you absolutely can't argue with its effectiveness. The best hangover cure in the entire world! Drink down a glass on your way out the door in the morning and you'll feel close to 100% by the time you get to work 
Brand name batteries at the best price I could find. A total 16 batteries were delivered 
My husband recently bought me the Chi Bling iron for Christmas and this spray came with it free. It is a nice light product to use and it doesn't seem to weigh my hair down like some of the cheaper drugstore products do. It is definitely worth the money. You get what you pay for 
This product did not cut any nose hair at all. I am not exaggerating to say NONE. I also bought a conair one and it was equally useless. I gave it one star instead of zero because it offers a 30 day money back guarentee and can be returned to the point of purchase. Also you can not use rechargable batteries in this unit only alkaline. There are no directions to this unit. Under directions it only gives information on how to install a battery 
The attachement is little delicate and flimsy. FItting might be an issue once in a while but overall I am satisfied with the product 
This item does what I wanted it to and was received as promised in very good condition. I give this product a good recommendation 
Have been very pleased with this product and use it every morning as part of my shaving and preparation for the da 
Well i think it funny to review this type of product for sure. Simple put this is a good solidly designed product. Its very attractive for what it is, and the value seemed like a great deal to me. My only minor objection is that one of the heads it comes with is a little short if you know what i mean ;) so those of us with deep removal issues can still sorta have a farm going on. However changing the head solves that problem. Comes with a rotary head which i use most of the time, and a saw head like most i have seen. 
I used a battery powered nose hair over 20 years ago and hated it! But this was so inexpensive that it made no sense not to try it. The reviews here were terrible! The unit switches from linear to rotary in a nano-second! And the battery cover was just as easy to open and close. I think maybe because it is SOOOO simple, people make it more difficult than it is. Just pay attention to the little markings on the side and read the instructions first. The real test was my gigantic hairy nostrils! WOW! Clean as a whistle in seconds! No pain, no pulling. And then I trimmed my mustache -- just as easy. The only thing I didn't like was that I bought it at K-Mart for twice the price I could have gotten it here for! But it was worth it! 
I found this tensiometer is very accurate, the mistake range is never over 5 mmHg up or down when you use it the right way, but you have to be clear that this is just for home use, electronic tensiometer can never replace a manual one. Sorry for grammar mistakes but I`m from latinamerica and english is not my natal leguaje 
its more than 2 years since i bot this. works great. would have been nice had it had an OFF button, but iam happ 
I bought this for my dad and he loves it. It's easy to set up and use. It's compact enough to take anywhere 
Samsung's monitor is great. Its easy to use, the numbers are large and it keeps track of your blook pressure for a considerable amount of time. I would definitely recommend this monitor to all 
When I first blew up the pillow, I was a bit skeptical of the odd bulges on the sides and back. As it turns out, though, someone was really thinking when they designed this puppy. The extra support helps to keep the pillow in place and to support your head whether you're sitting straight up, or laying semi-reclined on an overnight bus or plane. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 just because it is somewhat difficult to get it completely deflated and inflated, even when following the instructions about sqeezing the valve to keep it open. 
I didn't expect this pillow to feel like my home pillow...so given these expectations I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It supported my neck and head really well and was exactly what I needed for a long flight. It is perfect for travel and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to sleep on flights. It also comes with a little pouch, which is useful. 
If you are stuck in coach like a sardine for 8 hours, you'll love this. It supports your head and gives you different options of support. Deflates and stores in it's own pouch, really loved this 
My husband loves this great product and great price through Amazon 
These kinds of products are so hard to judge. So, trial and error has been my main form of selection over the years. Stumbled on this one and came out very well. It's an opaque, almost colorless pomade, nice and thick and a little goes a very long way! I have short hair, with lots of tecture cut into it and American Crew Pomade for Men( LOL, it's great for the ladies too!) is NOT heavy to your hair despite its thick appearance. Just use a small, dime sized amount at first. If you need more, i advise a little at a time. Applied right, your hair will take on any shape or direction you want and oh, the shine!! Beautiful, lustrous shine will help bring out your natural hair color and even heighten the effects of colored hair. Washes out very easy when time for that comes. Has a very masculine scent, but don't let that deter you, ladies! I'm telling you--this one has them all beat and I've used many brands. Price wise, I might hold off on it if I don't absolutely have to have it, but then, Amazon seems to be offering it at some very good prices 
I love this stuff. My skin feels amazing after I use it and it it gentle and non toxic. Also the jar lasts a long time so it's a great investment!! 
I took a huge gamble when I ordered this perfume. First, I had never smelled it before. Second, it's not exactly cheap. So when I received it in the mail, I was completely surprised--and amazed. This is quite possibly the best perfume I have ever smelled, and definitely the best I have ever owned. It's completely unique and sophisticated, without smelling too mature. I just can't get enough 
As a collector of fragrances, I have perfumes mainly in the floral family, from L'Occitane to Stella to Parfums del Rae. I always used the fragrance that suited my mood, or my clothing style. However, I took a chance based on the description of this parfum and it's discounted price and ordered a bottle. I am so happy I did! The drydown scent is so light and so unique, I put away most of my other fragrances and now wear only Lolita Lempicka for Women. It is almost addictive. And my husband actually loves this parfum on my skin, so I ordered the body lotion to layer the scent. I wish I were better at describing the scent, not being expert all I can say is that if you like florals, orientals, or woody fragrances, give this a try - it is the best of all possible worlds. I have now ordered Lolita Lempicka Midnight so that I can wear this day AND night for awhile. I wonder if the eau de cologne after shave for men smells as intoxicating 
The product arrived sooner than was told, which was great as it was a gift for Christmas. It is a very nice scent and is very much appreciated by my daughter 
This perfume is very soft and feminine:)Beautiful bottle and a great size that will last a while. I absolutely love it!This perfume prices everywhere for $80.00 or more.... so, to find it for $40 with free shipping and handling was almost unbelievable...What a great deal! 
Got these as a Christmas gift. They work great. I agree with the other reviews, these are not slippers that you want to walk on. I recommend wearing socks with these because I find that it tends to be too warm on my bare feet. The drawstrings are nice because it really keeps the heat inside the slipper 
The slippers are soft, warm and when you follow the directions smell great. The microwaveable packets keep feet warm for about an hour. The only downside is you cannot walk in the slippers with the aroma packets inserted. They also don't seem to be sturdy enough for regular wear around the house. Even the package states that they are not walking slippers. That would have been nice to know before purchasing 
I have extremely wavy, thick dark hair that frizzes very easily (read: hard-to-manage and annoying). I was so fed up with my hair style that when I went to the salon a few months ago, my stylist recommended this flat iron to me. I had tried in the past to straighten my hair at home with various other flat irons (with harsh metal plates) and round-brush-hairdryer combinations, but to no avail. I'm happy to say that the Vidal Sassoon Professional High-Heat Hair Straightener has lived up to its reputation by straightening my hair, changing my style, making my hair more managable, and continuing to demonstrate high quality in its design. The highlight of this straightener is its 2 1/4-inch ceramic plates coated in gold. The plates heat my hair from the inside to the out, creating smooth hair void of frizzies. The straightener also boasts a 60-second heat up feature and has 25 heat settings to accomodate any hair type. All you simply do is plug the unit in, turn the switch to on, set the heat level, and that's it! The 170 watts pack enough punch to cut down on styling time, as well. The unit's cord is short enough that it doesn't wrap up in a gigantic knot, but is long enough to move around my bathroom while I work on my hair. The flat iron is also extremely compact: when finished, and after it has cooled off, I simply wrap the cord around it and store in a bathroom drawer. It also fits easily into my suitcase when traveling. Finally, maintenance of this flat iron is very easy. Whenever the plates or outside handles become sticky with gel or hairspray, I simply wipe it off with a wet cloth. Overall, I am very pleased with this straightener. I have not had any problems with the gold coating flaking off or the unit burning up. I like how the flat iron doesn't dry out my hair and that my style stays straight throughout the day and into the evening (rarely any frizzies). In all honesty, the iron works so well that it only takes me about 20 minutes to style my hair in the morning. I highly recommend this flat iron: it's the secret to straight, stylish hair 
i actually saw this on the shelf at the store, and i just thought "hey why not try this". it's a lot cheaper than proactiv and it claims that it's been compared to proactiv. i do have a mild acne problem, but there are days when my face just tends to break out. i think this product irritated my face rather than helping. it just completely dried my face out. after 4-5 days, my face started hurting because it was so dry. but i thought i would wait a little bit longer. after a month or two, i couldnt take it anymore. 
I started using this product almost a year ago. I have been very happy. My skin is smoother, black heads and white heads are gone and I seldom have pimples ... something I used to get monthly 
I have had pretty bad acne since I was 14 (Im now 20). I never thought I would even make it just a little better. I tried this stuff and after 2 or 3 weeks I noticed a huge difference. I have acne, acne scars and huge pores that are really visible. This stuff made all 3 of those things go away. My skin is starting to look smooth instead of like it has holes. A bit of advice for people who have just started using it: *At first this stuff dried out my lips and made them chap, that went away after a few days. *I noticed that the next morning after using the 3-step stuff, I would get the white-head pimples, then by the end of the day they would go away. So if you get white heads after using this, don't think it is making it worse, the pimple is probably trying to fight the product 
I've had adult acne forever. I used proactiv for at least 5-7 years and do think it's a great product. However, after a while I found the fragrance was a bit too strong, and began irritating my eyes tremendously. I found acne free, and thought I'd give it a try since it was cheaper and easier to find locally too. I've been using it ever since, and have found even better results. The cost savings and convenience of finding locally, makes it a better choice for me. Plus I can buy a big bottle of cleanser separately. I always used to stack up on the toner and lotion since you never use as much as the cleanser. I love the product and would highly recommend 
I have had a consistent case of acne for years. While my skin wasn't always terrible, the acne was always THERE. I tried everything-- including Proactiv-- with no results whatsoever. Almost immediately after trying Acne Free, my skin cleared up. Completely. And it stays clear. The only problem is that if I get lazy or if I forget to do all of the steps, the acne comes back-- which is, of course, understandable. In order for this product to work, you need to do EXACTLY as it says. Some people have complained that it made their face red, but I haven't had any problems with it, perhaps because my skin by now is fairly used to harsh treatments. Just take it slowly and start off by using it once a day. This is a terrific product, and I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who has had no results with other treatments! Hopefully others will be as lucky to have the results that I did 
It either pulls your hair into it, or if you have thin hair it wont stay on at all. Then you find the gems on the floor (because they fall out) after you've stepped on it! OUCH 
This is a really fun product for girls. It works great and the jewels look so cute in their hair. It's easy to use as well. 
I think it is cute. It pulls a little when taking the gems out of your hair, but my daughter loves it 
I bought this for my 8 year old as a Christmas gift. She loves it. It seems easy to use, the gems stay in her hair, and they come out with little fuss 
my niece loved it. she used it on my hair once and it worked great, stayed put and the gems were reusable. Fun 
I bought 2 Conair Ouick Gems Hair Jewelers for 2 granddaughters. They absolutely love them. I have no regrets. They are worth the money and the jewels look great in their hair 
You have to make sure that you have a very specific amount of hair to put these on--if it's too small, they fall off; if it's too big, they fall off. We're getting the hang of it the more we use it, though. My daughter was so pleased to get this 
I received it pretty quickly, even though I ordered it over the xmas holidays, I did not get it by xmas, but I also did not expect too becuz I ordered it so late. It did come right after xmas, which was sooner than I expected. It worked great, my granddaughter saw the ad on t.v. and said she wanted it, which is why I ordered it. She loved it, it worked just like it said it would on the advertisement 
I ordered two sets of BraBABY Bra Washing Holders. When they arrived, there was no statement/invoice/receipt inside the box. I used them today to wash three bras. It was tricky to get the straps in the ball. When the washing machine was on, I can hear the balls bouncing around in it. When the wash was finished, and the bra straps were sticking out of the balls. My bras have some satin on the edge. The satin were all scratched up, probably from all that bouncing around. I am very disappointed 
The first monitor didnt work, but returning it was very easy. I got a new one within a few days. My mother who is 85 and not technically savy is able to use this without a problem. It comes with a nice storage case and batteries 
works well, I use it in my medical office and it is a fast and usefull tool 
Do not buy this item.It gives you error message no matter what you do 
I was in the hospital when this arrived. I had been off my arthritis meds by Dr.'s orders, husband brought this to me and I couldn't believe how much it relieved the pain in my knee. I used it without the gel pack at the hospital and the magnets really helped 
My Husband says they are a great help for his knees-He is in construction 
My knee on occasion "goes out" to the point that walking is uncomfortable. I was at Disney when it happened most recently and I got this knee pad. The cold therapy was excelent for reducing inflamation after all day walking and I was able to keep up with everyone. I was so worried my trip was ruined. I do not know if the magnets had anything to do with it, but the cold pack and size were perfect for comfort 
I like this product because its large enough to fit me. I am a big guy and most knee braces would not even come close to fitting. I get a good fit and great relief from wearing this brace. Im not sure how the magnets work, but the wrap keeps my knee warm even in cold weather. I would recomend this product to every one 
It is a superb eau de cologne with a long-lasting scent. I first tried it when by brother bought DG EDT as a gift 2 years ago and that made me an addict to this sophisticated smell. It is not uncommon to see people (both women and men) ask what brand I wear. I strongly suggest D EDT. The only downside is the price. If you like a stronger aroma you might like Kenzo EDT. 
This cologne has become an icon among male colognes. I guess it will never be out of fashion to wear this cologne every once in a while. The smell even gets better as it mixes with your body perspiration. Trust me, ladies will ask you 
I was originally nervous to buy such a distinctive product online, but I did and it was great! Thanks 
I have been very satisfied with this fragrance which I believe has a very distinctive scent that always intrigues others and ask for its name. The 4.2 oz. size is very manageable 
I've been holding out on buying a new set of hot rollers for about three years, because I couldn't find a set I liked: flocked (that means they have the fuzzy coating to grab your hair) multi-sized, and with those metal U-shaped clips that everyone else seems to hate. This set had all of that and then some! It's got 8 of the jumbo-sized rollers, which I was having a hard time finding, plus six 1-1/4 inch rollers and six 1-inch size. I have fine but thick straight hair that varies from just below the shoulders to bra-strap length, and with this set I can either do all-large rollers for body and a little wave, or use multiple small rollers for lots of curl. Plus, it came with both types of clips--the plastic "jaws" kind, and the U-shaped metal clips. I should say, I bought my set from a beauty supply store in my city, and I bought it on clearance for less than it retails here. Nevertheless I feel lucky to have found it and I would have paid more. The rollers heat very fast and hold the heat for quite a while, so I can get a good tight curl if I let them heat for 15 minutes and cool for 30. On the other hand you can just get some good body and smoothing in about ten minutes, if you're in a rush. Oh, and it has an On/Off switch, so you can cut the power without unplugging it. This is useful if your outlet is in a hard-to-reach place, as mine is 
I recently bought this set at a beauty supply for about the same price offered here. What is really great about them is that they heat up in about two minutes and when you put the clips in... you don't get that horrible line in your hair that you would if you used other clips or used a curling iron. I have extremely thick hair that is about shoulder length, and this set had the perfect amount and size of rollers. I am addicted to using this because it is so easy, and I get so many compliments on my hair. (I was having to dry my hair on velcro rollers, which takes over an hour with the dryer on high because my hair is so thick, to get anywhere near the body that I get with just a few minutes and this set. 
Twice Amazon sent me the WRONG item. I ordered a heating pad with massage and received heating pad only, so returned it; the SAME item was again shipped and returned. I NEVER received the item that I ordered--heating pad with massage unit. Very disappointed in your service 
I have used this almost every day since I bought it and I have found it to be sturdy (does not wad up like my old one did) soft and comfortable against my sore back with gently warm heat that relaxes some very sore muscles. Out of all the heating pads I have tried this is the best of the newer ones 
I'm pleased with the pillow. I purchased the pillow to help relieve neck pain and shoulder pain. I'm pleased that the pain is much reduced in both areas. The pillow is firm but not as firm as a memory foam pillow I was using. The pillow was delivered on the estimated date. I've been real pleased with shopping on Amazon.com. I've added some background noise of the ocean to sleep by that has been real nice as well 
This is a great product even for adults. My wife and I are older than we'd like to be and there are no kids in the house, but we prefer these wipes over all others due to the low price, pleasant, gentle scent and perfect packaging 
For many years I have used Bic's disposable single blade razors. They do the job but I never got a really close shave after the first one with the same razor. I also got at least one nick or cut every 3 or 4 shaves. I bought a Mach 3 Turbo, March 9, and have been pleasantly surprised at the ease of use, the lack of nicks and cuts, and the very close shave I get. I regret waiting until now to try this razor. The only negative I give it is the uncertainty of placement when I trim my sideburns. That could be because the razor's head flexes or bends so much. Still, I will not go back to disposable razors 
I've gone back and forth over the last 3-4 weeks with these razors and in the end, I like the way that they Quatro feels in my hand, but I think that the Turbo gives a closer shave with less drag and irritation. Also, when shaving against the grain for really close shaves, it is easier to get around my beard with the smaller head of the Turbo and there is far less irritation than with the Quatro 
I hope to never use a cheap can of shaving cream again. This is the best stuff. I've never used the high end English creams, but I cannot imagine them being much better than Proraso. The eucalyptus is a great smell and really helps give a great shave. The extra money this costs is well worth it. Do apply with a shaving brush instead of using your fingers to create the lather, it will only make it that much better 
I was hooked on Mennen Menthol Lather which is no longer made. My son introduced me to Proraso knowing that I was desparate (my 10 year supply of Mennen was used up). I'm now convinced that Proraso is better than any others I have ever used. It goes further and the lead-zinc tube allows you to get the last little bit. A truly superior product 
This stuff is real nice. While not as good as the Truefitt Hill Trafalger, it still have many of its own attributes that help make this stuff my shave cream of choice on the road. It has a nice eucalyptus scent (not at all like the Hall's lozenges we remember from being a kid) that has a nice tingle to it. You must use a real badger hair brush to get the most of this stuff, and using a Merkur Futur razor is also important. Since it comes in a tube, not a tub, this product is well suited for the road. Try the wet shave and learn to enjoy shaving for the first time in your life 
As a graduate student I have not gotten enough rest for years and have developed very dark circles under my eyes. With my fair skin, the dark cirles were very pronounced. This reasonably priced product worked quickly and has deminished the dark color under my eyes. I'm buying a two pack next 
I have been using this now for 4 weeks. I have seen no difference now then when I started and it stings like the devil when I use it! It makes my eyes burn terribly. I'm glad to see it has worked for some but it hasn't done anything for my dark circles 
This product is so amazing that I can hardly believe it! Within days of using it, my dark circles started going away and I could even tell where I missed areas because there was purple only where I missed putting the gel!!!! I barely even need concealer any more. Truly amazing 
I haven't seen the slightest change with the dark circles under my eyes yet. Grant it I've only been using it two weeks, but I definitely am not one of the lucky ones that can say I see any immediate changes at all. Unlike others who don't like this product underneath their makeup, I don't have a problem with it. I put it on, then some eye hydrate and then my concealor that I so badly need. Doctors said for yeeeeeeeeeears my problem was allergy related, then last year they said it was birth control related, and now they say it appears my blood vessels seem to be damaged. Whatever the case, NOTHING is helping, not Hylexin, no Hydroxatone, not Lemon Eye gel, not hydroquinone a bleaching cream and NOT VITA-K SOLUTION SUPER VITAMIN K. Just isn't working for me 
I found that this product produced little results and it mainly just stung the undereye area. 
I have used my venus razor since they 1st came on the market and I have always loved it, so when the breeze came out I was so excited to have the gel included. Well the 1st use was great, not problems except a lil slippery. The 2nd and 3rd use, gave me the worst razor burn I have ever had!!! THis razor is aweful and painful. I have written the company to tell them this too!! Do not waste your money and the health of your legs 
I participated in the marketing trials for this razor a year ago and have been diligently searching for it, waiting for it to hit the stores ever since. It was without a doubt the best razor I have ever used. It has a great shave gel built right in and it makes shaving super easy. Love it, love it, love it. If you're a lazy shaver like me (always in a hurry, grabbing the nearest bar of soap to make lather so you can hurry up and get out the door) you will love it too 
I bought this hotbrush with the hopes that it would shorten the time it takes to dry my hair straight. Well it does do that but you are left with a frizzy mess if your hair is naturally curly. The results are like using your hairdryer with a wide toothed comb and you still have to use your flat iron to smooth and straighten it out. All in all this product is definately not worth the money. Keep your blow dryer and round brush and save yourself $50 
My hair is course thick w/ some natural curl. I have never had any kind of styler that has made my hair so shiny and sleek. My hair would always have a frizzed dull look before this dryer. This dryer has replaced my hair dryer, flat iron, brush. I only use this Hot Air Styler and a pick comb. I can have my hair dried and styled in record time! It has a 3 year warranty but if it broke tomorrow, I would immediately order another! 
I have fine medium length hair and I use this brush for quick touchups and in a few minutes I got the straight look I want, with shine! It is light-weighted and so easy to use. It also comes with a great three-year warranty. A word of warning is: you cannot expect it dries your hair as quick as a powerful hair dryer. I would suggest you use your dryer first so your hair gets medium wet then use the hot brush. 
I am a busy architect and this is the 2nd pair of Clics I own. If you are active and need reading glasses they are perfect. Their only drawback is that they take two hands to put on! I'd look at slimming down the frames to make them less heavy and trimmer. Lastly ~ I've found these readers to be really rugged and good for outdoor use 
CliC Eyewear is a thoroughly convenient way to wear reading glasses. I keep them with me hung around my neck all the time. The glasses are made well. Almost every person who sees me click them together wants to know where I got them 
So far, these fit the bill. Just used them for the first time--find that they are easy to put on, and comfortable--and better yet, don't interfere with jewelry as they would if they hung off a chain/rope/string 
Very convenient to use. However, since the neck band is rigid and does not fold, it is difficult to carry 
Tired of juggling your reading glasses and sunglasses, of getting entangled in the chains, strings and other paraphernalia that prevent you from losing your precious seeing utensils. Click Readers will bring your freedom back. Whether hiking, biking, swimming or enjoying any other activity - your glasses are always there, ready for action! By far the best invention for people over 40 (ie needing reading glasses) I have seen. 
My husband bought three pairs of these glasses, and they are the only pair that he hasn't lost yet. He absolutely loves them. Just keep them around his neck all day and clips them together for quick use. I think they look funny; but who cares- they are convenient and a great product 
The only sunglass reading glasses I could find, plus because they can hang around the neck I don't forget where they are 
These are great for those days you just want to sit in the sun and read without sun glare. Great product 
Im only 28 and due to overwhelming stress my hair starting falling out- I didnt know what to do-i saw the add for this prodcut in a beauty magazine and decided to give it a try- Well my hair did start growing back and faster and thicker too! I like that its natural products not chemicals: 
I've always had long hair needed a new set of hot rollers. After considerable research, I bought the Babyliss am very happy with the results. My hair has better sheen after the rollers have been in the curls are lovely. The ceramic part of the curler really makes a difference. I'll be ordering more often from Babyliss 
The finishing touch pro is a geat little compact trimmer, i paid only $4.99 for mine and liked it so much I bought an extra one and wouldn't take $20.00 for them. They work really great and just keep on working, and it's kinda fun too. Its compact, you can carry it with you and cute too, mine has the jewel cap on it, which is just so attractive. I carry one in my purse for emergency situations and one in my bathroom for regular use. The only thing that would make it better is if it had a small mirror with it, otherwise, you can't really improve on perfection 
I can't say anything about the frequency with which this product is bought and doesn't work. However, I have had my Finishing Touch for almost a year, and I am happy with it. I am now getting to the point where I turn it on and it takes a while, with my fiddling around with it, for it to turn on (it might be the battery). But as far as hair, it seems like it can handle most anything, even a lot of hair. I have used it on several parts of my body to remove hair from my face and eyebrows, to my arms and legs, to more delicate parts. Most everywhere, it will remove all the hair you need removed. However, the hair does grow back quicker than with anything else out there you could use. Also, I have a hard time pulling it apart to change the battery. On the other hand, it's quick, it's cheap, it doesn't smell bad like Nair, it doesn't leave cuts like a razor and it doesn't hurt like waxing. All in all, it's the best thing I have found to remove hair 
I've had one of these little shavers for about a year and I think it peforms very well. I didn't expect to get razor smooth skin, that's not what I wanted anyway...I use it on my face and feet, whereever there may be extra hair that's not wanted and it works very well, cropping the hairs close without getting a burn or irritation. I guess if you have dark hair (I have blond), it might still show, but still, for what it's advertised for, I think it delivers...I'm buying a 2nd one for travel 
I use it whenever I need to shape my eyebrows and I don't feel like tweezing or waxing. Its very fast and simple to use 
I changed many batteries and fiddled and fiddled, but it won't work. It was a gift and cannot be returned. They offer no support or replacement options 
the item description says it "erases the hair" with its special "micro-technology." Basically, it is just a tiny electric shaver that works on batteries. They say it works great on facial hair, but seriously, I would NOT use it on my face. It would be a decent product if they didn't falsely advertise 
After only a few uses, my trimmer simply stopped working! No, it wasn't the batteries. And I was not within the allotted time frame for returning the defective item, so I am simply "out" my money and I am not happy about it! I should be able to receive some kind of compensation for my time and money 
After trying Love's, Huggies, Pampers Baby Dry, Parent's Choice, and these, my husband and I have concluded that Pampers Swaddlers are the most comfortable and leak-free diapers for our baby. These are the ones the hospital used as well. They are a little more expensive, but in the long run better because other diapers leaked out stool (I am nursing so my baby's stool can be runny) and these rarely do. They are also much softer than the Baby Dry and our baby seems to like them better. 
These diapers are great for little boys... They're the only diapers I found that didn't leak 
Works better than Huggies for my twin boys. One twin was a preemie and has thinner than average legs, and the other brand leaked. These don't and yet are still forgiving enough for my other son's larger legs. I'm a fan 
I switch over to warehouse brand after our babies outgrow these but these are great for the first few weeks. They got rid of the umbilical cord cut out and I miss that but they are still great early on. 
I didn't buy them online from here. But these are the best diapers. I used them with both my kids and never had any leaks. Plus they are soo soft. highly recommended 
I've only had a few leaks with these diapers. They never irritate my babies skin and she's never had a diaper rash 
Same experience as the last reviewer...I ordered on June 20th and haven't received the item yet. I kept receiving the emails from Amazon which asked for approval the updated shipping date. On the product URL site, Amazon still claims that this item is in stock and can be shipped in 24 hours. It is all BS. I called the customer service number many times and got told their fullfillment center has difficulty to ship the item out. This is a good product...however 1 star review for Amazon 
Before I bought this product I was given a sample pack featuring The Art of Shaving's pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and after-shave balm. They called it "One Perfect Shave" and they weren't kidding, really. This is by far the best shaving cream I have ever used. Though I highly suggest using a brush, the cream still lathers beautifully with or without one. It bonds to each hair like a rubber glove and protects my skin like no other. I never have any irritation, none. As for the scent, my girlfriend wouldn't want me to use any other kind. The sandalwood screams "male" and lasts a long time. I will never buy any other shaving cream 
My daughter uses this set regularly at home and at work. She was very pleased. This is a high quality item. Thank You 
Works great, puts out plenty of humidity, very quiet, has an automatic shut of 
Trimspa works great if you take it consistantly. I have to take about 4 to 6 tablets every day. I start with a few more per day initially and then after a few days I can cut it back a couple. If I take it as directed, I discover that after about 2 days I cannot eat nearly as much food without feeling pretty darn full. It isn't that I don't ever get hungry its just that when I do sit down to eat, the amount I feel full after eating is cut about in half. Then I don't feel the need to eat until the next meal. It helps kill snacking and overeating for me, which makes it great in conjunction with any type of modified eating program that you are trying to stick to. It does not make me feel jittery or weird. The biggest issue is just remember to take the pills 3 times a day and it does tend to work a little better if you can take it about an hour before each meal. I have discovered that I cannot lose more than about 12 pounds through just dietary changes so I have starting adding exercise to my program and the trimspa is helping tremendously, because usually when I start working out my appetite goes right up. I believe these are a great assist to any weight loss program you are trying to stick with 
I went out and got TrimSpa X32 yesterday, and so far I am very pleased. In the past, I have use other weight loss supplements and TrimSpa X32 as well. I haven't used any for quite a while and when I started yesterday, I was quickly reminded how well TrimSpa X32 had worked in the past. I took the first 2 tablets, and if you are sensitive to supplements I suggest taking 1 to start until you know how you feel. I had half of a chocolate milk for breakfast as that was all I could fit in my stomach. When lunch rolled around I ordered chicken fingers and halfway through them I was stuffed to a point where I had felt I had thanksgiving dinner. (This is why I suggest starting with 1 pill) By the time dinner rolled around I was so pleased with my day. I finished my chicken fingers and had low fat chips. Each time I ate, I felt I could only eat so much. I counted my calories and realized that this product is going to be a huge help. Counting calories and exercise is very important, there is no miracle pill, but I am happy so far with the assistance that I received from TrimSpa X32 
First what I do like about it: It helps suppress my appetite, and when I do eat I feel full faster. I take 3 a day, not the proposed 5 a day. I have been taking it for about a month and a half now, and have legitimatly lost 5 pounds (this isn't just fluctuation, I accounted for that). I didn't increase or decrease my work out activities. I swim 3 nights a week for half an hour. I did that before taking the pills, and didn't swim any extra days after taking the pills. And what I don't like so much: The bottle says to take 2 in the morning, 1 an lunch, and 2 at dinner. That seems so excsessive, and the pills are huge and kind of hard to swallow. At this rate the bottle only lasts 18 days (the 90-count bottle). Also after taking it for a month and a half straight, 3 a day, no skipping... I went out of town for a weekend and forgot the pills. Well let me tell you, when I got hungry I felt like I hadn't eaten in DAYS, I was starving. The hunger came back like times 10. So beware of that! All around I would, and will buy it again. Maybe a month and a half is too soon to judge, we'll see 
This product gave me a weightloss boost. Me being 18, and 240lbs at 6'2" I was overweight. It curved my appetite and made me feel full fast when I ate. It also gave me energy to exersize. I lost over 60lbs in 8 months while taking Trimspa and I could have my once a week "cheat" days. Check out [...] for more info 
it seems like an okay product and i want to try it but i am a little bit careful of that ...if anna lost i probably coul 
I had a terrible head cold and needed a humidifier asap. Picked this up and it did the trick. Now I'm glad I have it for when I run the heater in the winter and it gets so dry. I used to wake up congested when I ran the heater all night, but not anymore when I run this. One tank lasts at least 2-3 nights of use. It is kind of precarious to refill - you have to be very careful carrying it to avoid spilling the water that collects on top - but other than that it's SO easy to use. VERY quiet, too. Every so often it will "gurgle" but other than that it runs silently. It doesn't take up a lot of space, and it's cute too 
This little guy does his job pretty well, but is a pain to refill. It's pretty much every day or two, and it drips quite a bit when you lift it out to take to the sink. I would probably buy it again, but that has been a bit of a drag. 
It is a very good little humidifier. Easy to add water. Easy to clean. 1 gallon water is plenty for about 10-15 hours for maximum vapour. Any way I am happy having it in the Utah desert. 
I just got one of this humidifiers (panda shape). It is very cute and work fine. Easy to clean, you don't need filters. Humidifier came in secure package and was in a great condition. It's very simple to use! Just put water inside, plug it in and thats it! It starts produse cool mist right away!:) It is quiet! I am going to buy one more. I want to say about delivery. I ordered it from Target.com. Standart Shipping. Well... I got my himidifier in 2 days!!! Super fast! Great service! Highly reccomend this seller 
this was my first humidifier ever, so i'm not sure how it compares to others, but after reading many reviews on other humidifiers, it seems like many humidifiers can be hit or miss. this one does the job. it's super quiet when it's running. the only sounds it makes is the drippity drop of the water. my only complaint is the "glug glug glug" sound of the water it makes maybe every 5 minutes, but it's really not that loud and is very tolerable. it's great that it doesn't have any filters to change and that there's a control dial to let you adjust the mist. it's advertised as having low power consumption, so that's a definite plus too. i bought the bear shaped one and it's great that it's cute, so it's not just some random plastic box in your room that blows off mist. i recommended my friend to get one too and she loves it as well. 
This humidifier is indeed very adorable and whisper quiet. It doesn't have any filter to change so very low maintainance. We love it. 
Best Protein Bar I've found. Tastes good... no funky aftertaste and the crisps satisfiy the need for something crunchy! Love 'em! Only wish they had fewer calories. 
Not much to say other than this is a great product. It is similar to the Myoplex Lite (peanut butter crisp too) bars, but has much lower sugar content 
Of all the low carb bars I've eaten, these are one of the best. A little sweet but not too rich. They are crispy and not as dense as many others but they are still filling. If you are not familiar with low carb bars, they all seem to leave you needing a bottle of water when finished. These do that too but not as bad as most 
The towel warmer itself heats up just fine. But the towel never gets very warm. I thought it would feel like I had just taken the towel out of the drier. Maybe my expectations were too high. But if I had it to do over, I would not purchase this product 
My initial impression after using it for two days now is favorable. My gums have bled a lot, but that might be because I've never brushed my teeth this insanely till now. I believe the manufacturer claim that you 'can brush in 40 seconds' is fairly accurate, here's why: Because it uses 6 brush surfaces at a time (instead of 1 in a regular toothbrush), it truly IS a time saver in that respect. You certainly feel like you are geting more out of your typical 1 minute brushing that you ever did before. Someone was really thinking outside the box when they designed this thing. The big advantage to this product (to me), is that you still only spend 40 second to 1 minute per brushing ... vs. 3 minutes+ for a product like the sonicare. I just didn't see myself making the commitment and keeping to it over the long haul (just being realistic). Also, this product requires very little skill to properly position (just bit down, hold hydrabrush with two fingers, so it can self-pivot ... whereas sonicare and other electric brushes require 30 seconds per quadrant and you must be skilled enough to aim it and angle it ... sure, not hard, but if your using bad technique, then yours also not doing a good job. I did accidently run it on high the first time, before I realized that low was the second click over, not the first click over, which seems kind of counter-intuitive to me. I should have looked at the unit closer, as it shows "2 dots" (for fast) and shows "1 dot" (for slow) ... they tried, but I still got it wrong somehow. As a result of my first use and the high setting, my rear gums bled a lot. This was documented in the instruction and seem normal (to bleed the first few days). I think the fast speed will ultimately be what I want to use, but slow is nearly as effective and still quite a workout for the teeth and gums. Clearly, slow is best for newbies like myself. As I write this, I can still feel my gums and they feel like they got quite a workout. The brush unit itself is quite big, but the brushes were smaller than expected, which was a good thing. The pictures online made these brushes appear to be quite huge and I wondered how I'd have room for it all in my mouth. Some people with small mouths might potentially have an issue using the hydrabrush. Some people with small hands might potentially find holding it a bit cumbersome. It works fine for me, despite the large size. My kids saw me using it today after work and they were like "wow dad, thats cool" ... "it looks like it does a REALLY good job!". I had read that the brushes were not easy to put on and take off -- but it seems fairly easy, not really hard. I wouldn't want to share an electric toothbrush with anyone in the first place! I took them off to clean off the brushes a little better, so I removed the brushes by pressing in a small metal pin on each brush head (there are two brush heads totaland pull) and pulling each one out -- not hard to do if you ask me. Putting them back on was simply: push on, click ... its on, then repeat for second head. I worry a litle about the dual motors holding up over time. It seems like the motors almost bog down at times on my rear molars, esp. on the low speed ... but it DOES keep going. You can bite down a little less and it seems to relieve the motor strain somewhat. I've noticed this is mainly only observed after a week of use. Fully charged, it's a powerhouse. I'm trying to see how many days it'll last on a single charge. So far, two days and still going strong. Its doing a lot of work, so I perhaps worry that the batteries won't last long. I will say that it "feels" like I just got out of a dental cleaning, for the most part. You know, its a good, clean feeling -- but also one where you feel a bit abused. My teeth and gums feels pretty beaten up in just 1 minute. I will say that I perceive the 1 minute brush time to be VERY effective, based on how clean it feels after such a short period of brushing. It feels like a brushed a LOT longer than I did. I hope my gums get used to this and stop bleeding in a few more days. The bleeding never lasts long, which I think is a good sign. I read somewhere that this toothbrush is not waterproof, and that appears to be true, as it came with a 'water shield' to go around the brush unit, just below where the brushes attach. This seems to work pretty well and it doesn't seem to come loose. So far, the unit is staying dry with little to no extra effort on my part. I don't really use the included holder or case, I just set the unit on the side of the sink (on a small washcloth) so it can drip dry into the sink. Thats just me. The unit charges overnight and they tell you not to overcharge it beyond that. It blinks while charging and then stops after its charged. THey says its good for something like 40 uses, which I'll be surprised if thats true. I'd be happy if it lasted for 20 1 minutes sessions. I've used it 5 times thus far. Using the hydrabrush consists of holding the unit with two fingers (loosely) and then biting down somewhat on the brushes and letting it glide down your teeth somewhat on its own. You do push and pull it along somewhat, but you don't have to angle or work on brushing technique at all. This is truly a gadget which could turn us all into brushing idiots. This is quite strange, but seems to be pretty easy to do and it's hard to imagine people having a hard time using it, after adjusting to its strangeness. The small amount of toothpaste I put into each brush seems to get stuck and does take a little extra cleaning to remove after brushing. Maybe I'm not putting in on right. The owners manual makes it sound like toothpaste is 'optional' -- strange. The feeling I get after using the hydrabrush is -- "wow, my teeth feel really clean". I don't think my back molars have ever been brushed with this much vigor before. I guess the real test will be (the comments I get) at my next dentist appointment. Update: bleeding of gums has long since stopped and the hydrabrush is still going strong on the original (first) charge. I'm very impressed with the brush, as it appears to be doing a good job with my teeth. I'm hoping for a good comment from my dental hygienist on my next visit. I've also been using the Waterpik ... and its also a very good product. No, I haven't tried the extra reach brushes. Since my teeth were badly worn down by childhood grinding, I fugured my teeth were too short to require those brush heads. I think I'm getting plenty of coverage with the basic heads, but I could see how people with better teeth (taller teeth) could require the extra reach heads. The hydrabrush did finally run out of power from the initial charge -- and I would say I got a good 2 weeks on the charge, if not more. One minor concern that has come up after using the hydrabrush, is the amount of noise it makes, esp. when using at bedtime, when others might already be asleep. It gets louder the more drained the batteries get, so it might be more of a motor strain noise than anything. I've noticed fully charged batteries are more quiet. I'm still impressed with how good this makes my teeth feel after only 1 minute of brushing. I believe its about time I write a review for amazon, not that I've had some time to use this product. I would add that the hydrabrush would probably not be so great for little kids, since the brush itself is quite big and might be too much for a little pallete, with little teeth. Probably ages 10+ would be appropriate. Update: I have since switched to the high speed setting. I would also say that (for me) this product, like a water pik, can be a tad messy and requires you brush over the sink, so that water and toothpaste can drop into it while brushing. It's not a major amount, but I do find that a controlled 'drool' while brushing is almost necessary, unless you stop in the middle. I just drool and complete it in 1 minutes or less. I do advise using the included rubber (waterproof sheath) that is included, as it keeps the water from running down onto the handle while in use. Since the unit is not fully waterproof, using this is mandatory in my mind. I had to buy this to see if this device was "for real", or just another infomercial gimmick ... but I'll say, it's for real ... and if you go into it with an open mind and some flexibility for a little noise and mess ... this will really do a nice job on your teeth. The replacement heads are cheaper than sonicare as well. A four pack is really two complete replacement sets. A two pack is a single replacement set 
I've had other electric toothbrushes before quite liked them, but this HydraBrush is by far superior to any I've ever used before! I started, as suggested in the literature, with the extra soft set of brushes, and after I got the knack of using this new method, brushed for a shorter period the first few times. As was explained, gums did some bleeding the first few times,( I bleed very easily) but they were not painful bleeding was of short duration. Obviously massaging of the gums is a healthy way since so many people develop gum disease this will help head off such a potentially serious problem. I also like the HydraBrush because once it's charged, it is unplugged and placed in the holder which can be put ANYPLACE (one isn't tethered to the recharge cord). So it can be stored in a cupboard or any other spot away from the sink area, just wherever it's convenient for YOU. I've used it at least 30 times on this same first charge...just have to turn the dial on the brush it starts right up. I purchased this toothbrush because of the great feedback when Amazon had a great Friday sale, so now that I'm a complete believer, I'm hoping for a repeat of that sale as I want to get one for each of my family this time 
This is a really cool way of getting your teeth clean in a short amount of time. The 2 speeds allow you to start slow until your gums get used to the brush. I started with the faster speed and love the way my teeth feel after 30 or 40 seconds of brushing. What is really awesome is you are brushung upper and lower, inside and out at one time. I recommend this to all of my patients and they too really like how clean their teeth feel 
This is a radically different toothbrush, but it didn't take me long to get the hang of using it properly, and my teeth feel cleaner then they ever have before. I really am glad that I bought it 
Technique for using takes a little practice but its a great toothbrush allowing one to do the job in half the time.. 
This is not an ordinary toothbrush. It took me a few times to adjust how to angle it, however it was worth the initial ackwardness. My teeth have never looked or felt cleaner! And in half the time. What a creative concept of brushing the top, bottom, front, and insides of the teeth at the same time! Pure genius...worth every penny and more. D.Landis www.gelwithme.co 
This is the first trimmer I have owned that cuts my nose hair rather than ripping it out. I have tried 2 other trimmers from other companies, and this is the first time I ever used a trimmer that didn't make my eyes water. This alone makes it a 5 in my book. I'm an average sized guy. The trimmer has a comfortable grip and fits in my hand really well. I don't make much use of the other attachments, but the nose hair trimmer made this product a very good deal for me 
Without having to spend a great deal for professional whitening systems, these Crest WhiteStrips do a pretty decent job. I personally would not recomment do the whole 20 day program though, because after just 3 or 4 uses you will see some noticeable results without stripping too much of the enamel off your teeth 
These things work. Once you figure out how to use them. All you do is carefully hold each end with finger tips, using the nuckle of each finger to raise or lower lip, center and lay strip across teeth. Use your finger nail to tuck into spaces between each tooth, making sure to keep fingernail in the space of the tooth you just tucked before you move onto the next space or tucking it into that one will pull the last one out. Once you do it a couple of times, it is smooth sailing from then on. I do not think that you will find another whitener that is this easy to use and this reasonably priced, that actually works very, very well. I'm smiling for you right now so that you can see what I mean. ;], Impressed aren't you? I know I was and I will definetely buy this product again. I also recommend it to all of my friends who are not as bright smiled as I now am. Do your self a favor--Get this! Kim Schil 
Well, I won't reveal my age here, and I don't know if my teeth were yellowed enough to NEED 20 years taken off them, but I will say I - and others around me - am seeing results after only 3 days with this system. I received a free sample package through BzzAgent, a company that creates "buzz" about products through word of mouth. However, I am a natural skeptic... I guess I believed these products were just out there to prey on vulnerable smokers who are self-conscious from all us non-smokers picking on them. As a non-smoker who nevertheless loves dark-coloured drinks (coke, root beer, tea, coffee), I've never used any kind of whitening product, except toothpastes which didn't work. From the Crest Whitestrips commercials, I thought the strips would be something almost invisible that you could wear while at work, on the subway or wherever. Not quite! For what it's worth, they sort of look and feel like bandaids on your teeth; slippery bandaids that wiggle around if you try to do anything more stressful than write Amazon reviews. :-) BUT let's put this into perspective: you use them twice a day (1/2 hr each time) for ten days and you're DONE for a good long while (how long depends on your personal eating/drinking/smoking habits). You can even use one strip for 1/2 an hour, then start your second strip right away afterwards... to get it all over with even faster. The first evening I tried Whitestrips Renewal, I put them in to watch TV, and I don't think I had them in quite right because they kept slipping around. Also, I didn't rinse my fingers and the peroxide made my fingertips turn white and sting. However, a quick rinse took care of that. DO NOT get this stuff in your eyes, on your clothing or any other delicate surface. It's powerful stuff! Anyway, I was cursing the strips until I realized that I would just have to not speak for half an hour while I had them in. Maybe other people can manage it, but talking doesn't work for me with the strips in. Since then, it's been a breeze each time. SO... I guess the caveats are that you should set aside time to do this, during TV-watching or web-surfing downtime (as a bonus, you may lose weight from not snacking for that half-hour!), and not expect to be out doing errands with the strips on like the people in commercials seem to be able to do. Anyway, if you want to turn back the clock by a few years and turn up the compliments, the Whitestrips Renewal system seems like a great way to go - at a fraction of the cost of professional dental whitening 
I'm an ex-dental hygienist who delved into the depths of people's mouths for about 20 years, so healthy teeth mean a lot to me--especially my own. When the in-office dental bleaching first came around, I wasn't interested in trying it because, at that time, I felt I really didn't need it. The cost to patients then was close to $500. Ten years later and no longer practicing dental hygiene, I was ready to try some of the home products that were on the market. I regularly used, and continue to use, a whitening toothpaste (which basically just removes superficial surface stains from coffee, etc.) Then I tried the Night Effects "paint on" liquid. Besides being gooey and sort of a pain to use (not to mention looking like Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel when I went to bed--not an attractive look, ladies) I really didn't see a noticeable whitening. It's been a couple of years since that attempt, so I was ready to try this product. But I have to tell you that I found it for about half the going price from a seller on that well-known online auction site (which shall remain nameless, but you know the one.) You can also go on the Crest website right now (May 2006) and get a coupon for $7.00 off if you want to buy it at a drugstore or supermarket. I found these strips easy to apply, but someone with large hands or not a lot of dexterity might have a bit of difficulty. That could be overcome with a little practice. They do "stick" quite well to your teeth, but you can also maneuver them around easily if you need to reposition them during the treatment. I haven't experienced much sensitivity after using them, and I do back-to-back treatments, which is okay if you don't want to space them out over the course of the day. You can even skip a day if your teeth are especially sensitive. I did the upper strips alone first; that way you can lighten the lowers gradually to match the upper better. Most people aren't as concerned about the whiteness of their lower teeth because the uppers are more visible when smiling. I don't think you'll get "blue-white" teeth like Ed McMahon, but who wants that anyway? Especially if you're over 50, because let's face facts--there are a lot of other things that give away your age faster than less-than-white teeth! (Now if they came out with Age Defying Face Strips--the face lift in a box--I'll take one!) Seriously, the Renewal Whitestrips did lighten up my teeth quite nicely and got rid of the grayish look they had taken on over the years and also some yellowish areas where the enamel had become thinned. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the product and would use them again when my teeth, inevitably, begin to look dull. (Oh, and I'm going to turn 60 next year, so I guess I can be an official "baby boomer" spokesperson for this product! 
This towel is excellent. I wish it came in more colors or even white and I still don't know how to use the snap that is attached but I love the absorbency of the towel. It cuts my hair-drying time in half 
Intially this product worked excellently. Gradually, pieces started to fail. Button control failed. Returned unit and received a replacement. New unit power stream control failed after warrentee period out. Buy it as a throwaway if you can afford it. 
A decent nail brush. I purchased it to clean out the assorted grime that accumulates after a day of construction, and it does fairly well. I wish it had stiffer bristles, and also have had some problems with grimy water getting inside the body of the brush, as it is constructed of two pieces popped together. This is not an issue for anything but aesthetics, however, as it does not effect the function of the brush. 
Good customer service and quick delivery. Would use this vendor again. Thanks 
I ordered 6 of these from J R Music/Computers (went directly to them because I could only order 1 or 2 from the Amazon website at the time) to save on shipping because my last nail brush w/a single row for nails was purchased from Avon 32 years before. I found that if you use the same brush over and over the single row of bristles seems to splay (spread out) and not able to get under the nails as when new. Since we have them placed in the kitchen and 2 bathrooms I found that the less used ones seem to stay in better shape. I ended up purchasing 6 more when Amazon.com had them for sale recently (with free shipping this time) and hope that alternating use of more than one will cause a better lifespan 
We bought rechargeable batteries of all sizes to use in the wide array of baby gear for our son. We have these particular batteries in his swing and crib light and music toy, and they last for weeks on a charge. These will definitely save us money in the long run and are less wasteful than single-use batteries 
This thing is hard as a rock. Like walking on pebbles. I received no effect from it whatsoever. 
While I am by no means a foot massage specialist, I can definitely say that this feels better than a few similar products that I have tried. And for the price you really can't go wrong giving it a try. As a side note -- I think this is a really good product for people who normally have very ticklish feet. My girlfriend is one of those people and she was actually able to use and enjoy it without spazzing out like she normally does. : 
This Wooden Foot Roller Massager is an excellent product. It's lightweight, inexpensive, and provides an easy way to simultaneosuly relax and rejunvenate tired, achy feet. It's wide enough to roll both feet on it, and let the acupressure balls work their magic. 
.. WOW .. this product is truly great! I have tried other foot rollers, but they werent as effective as this one is. The spikes give each foot a deep and pleasurable massage. After a long day's work, I use this roller to soothe the pain in my feet. Cons: Just wish it was a bit wider 
I bought this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas and she was thrilled with it. She loved all of the attachments and giving herself and her friends a "professional" manicure - perfect for sleepover parties. All of the attachments fit snugly into the unit so you don't have to worry about pieces getting lost. The perfect gift for a girly-girl 
I bought one for my boyfriend because he grows hair faster than any other human being I know. He didn't think that he was going to like it because it is a AA battery foil shaver, but he did and he loves it! He doesn't use it all the time even though I wish he would but before he needs to go to work he runs it over his face and it's done. And it didn't cost me an arm and a leg to buy it for him. Bonus, it's washable and I thought that that was only what really expencive shavers would do. Think again 
Bought this razor for my husband for Christmas. I had been looking for something to replace a battery-operated Aramis that he had used for years and was very disappointed when it finally stopped working. He loves this new Braun Pocket Go; has used it almost exclusively since he got it. It not only does an excellent job - which you might not normally expect from a battery-operated razor - but it's the perfect size. Thanks, Braun 
Bought this as a emergency back-up shaver and like it so much that I use it regularily! Good quick clean shave for a great price. Have used it for 3 weeks on the 1st set of batteries and it is still going!!! Due to it I have purchased the Braun 1775, which got very high ratings from Consumer Reports! 
For any one who loses their reading glasses or doesn't know where to put them these glasses work great. The magnet is strong and the glasses comfortable. This is especially true on the beach. They are what they claimed to be 
I am a busy architect and this is the 2nd pair of Clics I own. If you are active and need reading glasses they are perfect. Their only drawback is that they take two hands to put on! I'd look at slimming down the frames to make them less heavy and trimmer. Lastly ~ I've found these readers to be really rugged and good for outdoor use 
CliC Eyewear is a thoroughly convenient way to wear reading glasses. I keep them with me hung around my neck all the time. The glasses are made well. Almost every person who sees me click them together wants to know where I got them 
So far, these fit the bill. Just used them for the first time--find that they are easy to put on, and comfortable--and better yet, don't interfere with jewelry as they would if they hung off a chain/rope/string 
Very convenient to use. However, since the neck band is rigid and does not fold, it is difficult to carry 
Tired of juggling your reading glasses and sunglasses, of getting entangled in the chains, strings and other paraphernalia that prevent you from losing your precious seeing utensils. Click Readers will bring your freedom back. Whether hiking, biking, swimming or enjoying any other activity - your glasses are always there, ready for action! By far the best invention for people over 40 (ie needing reading glasses) I have seen. 
My husband bought three pairs of these glasses, and they are the only pair that he hasn't lost yet. He absolutely loves them. Just keep them around his neck all day and clips them together for quick use. I think they look funny; but who cares- they are convenient and a great product 
The only sunglass reading glasses I could find, plus because they can hang around the neck I don't forget where they are 
I've used it for the past 7 years and I still get compliments about the way I smell... so, I keep buying it.. 
My mother is in the cosmetics/hair products industry, so I have gotten to try many different expensive leave-on hair treatments. Nothing comes close to Silk Infusion. I have long hair, a bit on the dry side, but everytime I use this product, just a quarter, the comb slides effortlessly through. In addition, when the hair dries, I don't have "sticky", "solidified", or heavy hair sections to deal with. Worth every penny 
My hairstylist referred this product to me after she noticed alot of frizziness and breakage in my hair. This serum has worked beautifully to restore my hair back to health! It makes my hair very shiny and gives it a nice smell! After I shower I put a dime size of this in my hair and massage it through. After I comb my hair out I use "Chi's" Straight Guard. It acts like a gel or mouse. Its great too! After my hair has dried and I have used the straightening iron I finish my hair off with "Chi's" Shine Infusion. The shine infusion acts like a polisher. Its terric too! I recommend all of Chi's products to anyone!! 
I am African American and this is an absolutely wonderful product for our hair. It has made my hair very soft, frizz free and there is less damage from my flat iron and curling iron. 
I waited a couple of weeks to write this review so I could let my face get used to a new razor. Background: I have used Norelco rotary shavers since I began to shave as a teen. My skin has always been sensitive and any time I tried a non-rotary shaver my face would become red and irritated. I also felt I was getting the closest electric shave possible with a rotary shaver. Sometimes I will go several days without shaving and as much as I liked rotaries, they do not do well on a heavy beard growth. The switch: Whenever the blades needed replacing on my rotary shavers I would buy a whole new razor. The price of replacement blades is almost as much as the shaver itself. My most recent Norelco served me well but in recent months shaving became a dreaded experience. Norelco uses a motor rather than a vibrator like most other shavers and it can tend to slow down when the blades are dull and the beard is thick. The decision: Although I have never had luck with non-rotary shavers I tried a friend's Braun once and was surprised how much closer it shaved and how my face felt good afterward. His was the cheap $29 model and I would have been happy with it, but I liked the style of the Model 5775. Anything more expensive seemed to be just more gimmicks. I simply cannot see what would justify over $100 for an electric razor. The review: This is the closest shaving razor I have ever owned and it actually makes shaving a pleasure. The wider head and the way the various slots are arranged lets me shave by gliding the razor over my face. No pressure needed. The bad: It feels big and heavy (which can be taken as a positive ... is feels remarkably well built). The swivel head is pure gimmick. It doesn't swivel during normal shaving and seems to be useless. Braun could have made the shaver smaller, lighter and with fewer parts prone to break if they left that "feature" off. Highly recommended - excellent value. 
I can put it this way it, Does a great job of shaving and cleans super easy. This might not annoy others but the motor vibrates very hard and its not the most comfortable thing to hold when you shave. Overall this is a GREAT shaver for the price. I have never tried the 150 dollar shavers so who knows I might be missing out!!!!!!!!!! 
I used this shaver for about two months and it was a great disappointment and waste of time. The shaver would only cut close if I went against the direction of the hair. This leads to extreme irritation - I had sores that would last weeks. Unless you want your face to look like that of an acne infested teenager stick to Gillette. I acknowledge that people's skin is different and some (maybe most?) will experience no irritation. But those with sensitive skin and/or whose beards' hairs change direction should beware. 
One of the best shavers Braun has made in a long time and has many options for use. You can use it just like it is,brush it out and then rinse with hot water. Another option is you can purchase a clean and charge stand.Also you can purchase a 12 renewal pack which comes with a cutter block and foil,and 12 cartridges for your clean and charge stand.Also they make two cases for the 5775,one is a square soft case and they also make a hard case. You can buy a protective cap for the foil,and clean out brushes.I have been using Braun shavers for over 50 years.I presently own a 5775 model Braun and I highly recommend it to anyone. 
The shaver works very well, feels comfortable in the hand and does clean beautifully when held under water. Excellent purchase if you want an economical yet sturdy shaver. 
got this for my daughter and her family. I don't care for it, too soft to even stay together but they all love it so 5 stars for them 
Pro: Shave as close as blades. It may take a while, but it will get the job done. (Based on just my person experience, comparing to Braun 1000, 4000. 500, and 8000, the new Norelco SpeedXL, and Panasoic Linear). Con: Poor build quality in all area, look and feel, fits and noise level (loud), shake, power connector, and so on. (The new Norelcos have the similar problems - look and feel cheap. Far less solid than my old faithful Quadra. Braun and Panasoic feel better build. Brauns are pleasure to my eyes and hands. But unfortunately, no one shaves as close as Remington) And it's a shaver after all and it supposes to shave. If this Remington doesn't last (I have my reasons to be a bit worried), I will have to get another one of the same. Only hope Remington will at least keep their technology intact over time. (Side note, among all the auto cleaning systems, the one comes with the Braun 8000 series really works: fast, clean, easy to get the shaver in and out of the station, and does charge and wash separately. Too bad Remington doesn't come close in the washer technology, and Braun doesn't cut as close!) P.S. I have no beard or mustache, but lots of whiskers in all directions around and under chin. All other shavers I've tried simply won't go there. The difference is loud and clear, literally: when the whiskers got cut down, you can hear it. All shavers work great in the initial cutting phase. But Only Remington continues on after that, while all others just do empty runs, and my fingers clearly tell me there're more to be cut. Bottom line: Try it. Don't get scared away by the bad raps on the web. I tried Remington as my last resort. And I never regret that I did 
I purchased this to use on the desk chair in my office at work. I was basically interested in the heat feature. The heat and massage turn off after 15 minutes. This is described as a safety precaution but it is highly annoying to have to re-set everything every 15 minutes. j 
I used this Conair Styler for six weeks this fall throughout a six week trip to Asia. The Conair fully lived up to its promises, and quickly did a great job in the most humid conditions in widely varying temperatures. Easy to pack, user friendly, and great results, and it did work fine with international electical transformers 
I own a large bulky Remington hot curler set (which I liked accept for the "clip-on" marks left in my hair). I purchased the Conair curler set specifically for travel purposes and I have to say, the Remington set went back into its box and up in the closet. I use the Conair set for everyday use now and I love them. The Remington set left my hair kind of "fly awayish" from static or something. The Conair set, while giving great volume and curl, eliminates the static, giving a much healthier look and shine to my hair. And the final advantage, there are no clip marks left from use. I am really pleased with this product 
Needed a compact size for traveling and so far, these seem to work well. The curlers are not heavy and the clips pack well in the case. I also like that you heat them up in the case. I have medium shoulder length hair and the 12 curlers are plenty. Only drawback, it would have been a nice feature if the curlers indicated when they are ready but not a big deal. They don't get super hot but the curl was just as i get with my regular hot rollers 
I recently purchased these curlers after seeing them in a magazine. I was impressed by the compact size, the weight of the curlers (not heavy), and the clips included to hold the curlers. The clips hold the curlers in place, and the curlers are effective in producing a nice curl. Due to the limited number of curlers in the set, this product may not work well with really long hair. I have shoulder length hair, and the 12 curlers included were just enough. These curlers would be perfect for camping and traveling! P.S. I have tried other compact curlers, and these by far are the best available 
DECENT JOB FOR THE MONEY. EASY TO USE,CHARGE,CLEAN,ETC.REASONABLY GOOD SHAVE, BETTER WHEN USING A SMALL AMONUT OF FOAM SHAVING CREAN THAN DRY, BUT IT WILL DO A DECENT JOB DRY . I LIKE IT. 
got this shaver for 2 days....used it twice and now it's in my trash can. the thing is that i dropped it and it broke...however, i have dropped my last shaver numerous time and it was still intact. this shave is just too fragile....all the parts are made out of weak plastic. 
It is a nice shaver. I like how it is usable wet and dry. The only problem is that the trimming razor is a little weak 
The shaver is great for the price. It provides a very close comfortable shave. No problems. I have not checked the battery life yet, but will soon 
Ever get sticker shock when you go to replace those foils and cutter blocks on electric shavers? Yep . . . "ben air dun gnat" as the old country boys say. As long as Panasonic makes little inexpensive shavers like this one .... I'll never go through that again. I'll just buy a whole new razor. I picked this little gem up for $[...] on Amazon.com It cuts really good! You can shave wet or dry. It has a double foil. The foil does not cover as large an area as some shavers so it takes a couple of minutes longer to shave, but it does a really nice job and I have a pretty thick beard. The ability to shave wet and with shaving cream reduces neck irritation. Comes with a small, unique charger base that plugs into an outlet and the shaver sits nice and tidy out of the way. Want to save some money? Pick up one of these today. Panasonic is the best in the world at electric shavers 
Solid purchase for the price. Not spectacular in any respect, but gets the job done. No glaring deficiencies or problems that I've run across yet 
Strengths: Cheap; sleek design; wet shave; retains charge for a long time Weaknesses: Does not come with international voltage charger; not very good for hair along neckline Summary: At its price its a really neat thing. As Braun points out, shaving a wet skin does not give a close shave because the skin swells when wet. So I dont prefer the wet shave. Yet the feature is good for those who suffer from a rash or itch with a dry shave. It does take a bit of getting-used-to for a dry shave. Normally within 2-3 weeks most people can adapt to it. This one like most straight-head shavers is not the best around the neckline and you may need to learn a few tricks on ur own to get a close shave around that area. It retains its charge for upto 5/6 shaves provided you shave at least once in 2 days and of course depending on the rate of ur beard growth. It doesnt come with any fancy accessories like a stand and brush like Braun does. But hey... u r paying half the price 
Having used a variety of shavers from Remmington, Norelco and Braun, the Panasonic ES4025SC is by far the best yet. The most obvious improvement is how quiet the unit operates. Others sound like a buzz-saw, but you barely hear this one. It is especially effective on the body hair, but also works well on facial and head hair thicknesses. The Panasonic also never bites, as often occurs with other shavers. Unless they discontinue this model, I will never buy a different shaver again 
My boyfriend had his eye on one of those expensive shavers with the cleaning system, and ended up getting this from a family member for Christmas. He was doubtful but gave it a try anyway. The shave isn't as baby-smooth as with a fresh razor, but he doesn't get any nicks or cuts. He also likes the trimmer for getting the moustache/goatee looking neat and tidy. I didn't give this a 5 because I feel like it should last longer between recharges. We don't have power outlets in the bathroom and it's a pain to have to stop mid-shower when the battery runs out to throw it back on the charger and hope it has enough juice before the hot water runs out. I also have to admit that I've stolen it on a regular basis to do my legs. It's more time-consuming than a regular razor, but I don't have as many missed spots in those hard-to-reach places and I like not accidentally peeling the skin off of my ankle and knee. One thing that I noticed is that if you go over the area with the trimmer first (to get any longer-than-stubble hairs) and then put a little bit of shower gel directly on the head of the shaver, and run it under the shower water, it works much better. Again, a time consuming process but the sleek, smooth result is worth it 
After 30 years of shaving with a blade, I have finally found an electric razor that works good enough to abandon the blade. I have been using this for over two years now and I am very pleased with the results (so is my wife!) As long as I use it everyday, or maybe skip one day once in a while, it works great. After a vacation from shaving, I need to get out the blade again or go to a barbershop 
I brought this shaver as a gift for my father. His old one was well...old. It didn't shave closely and he looked kinda unshaven even when he did. We just thought that was normal, but after he started using this shaver boy did he look different. His cheeks were softer too. My mom was happy too, so I've said all that to say, he seemed really pleased with this one. The cleaner is a great part of it too. Just don't go yanking the thing around, it doesn't work the way you would think it does. Think of the cleaner like a dishwasher, you wouldn't open the dishwasher while it was on so don't take the shaver out of the cleaner while it's cleaning. One last thing: The cleaner is loud. So if you want to scare someone silly don't tell them about it and watch them jump out of their skin 
The shaver is fantastic, as most of the reviewers agree. However, after two months of gentle use, the cleaning stand stopped working. Braun is telling me to send it to a repair shop but, as luck would have it, I can't find my receipt so I can't get it repaired under warrantee. Even if I could find the receipt, I would have to send the stand in at my expense. I bought this shaver because I felt I would be buying quality. I am a product designer by profession and I feel that this product is not worth the money, especially in light of their repair policy. If they were to stand behind their products, I would be fine with this failure, but, as it stands, I regret buying this shaver and I doubt I will purchase anything else from Braun 
Cleans, and shaves great. It travel's well. It is a great shaving system 
Your product was ordered for my aging parents and they love the remote. It fits very well and the large buttons are great. Thanks for the excellent product!!! Richard Roja 
I got two of these shower heads and they were both defective. I returned the first one, got another, and it was defective too. I would not recommend this product at all 
Easy installation, great selection of jets, ....my husband says to tell you that "the jets can get into every nook and cranny." Enough said! We both like this product and are pleased with the style and quality 
This product works great, I can use it while being pregnant. It does not contain DEA which studies are showing may cause cancer and interfere with fetal brain development. I love the smell too!! 
My friend Mary-Anne has given away many of these razors because she thinks they are so great. I was the recipient of one from Mar and then I went out and bought an extra for travel and have been recommending it all over the place. No cuts on your knees, convenient storage case with sealed extra blades (no rusting while waiting) and a solid grip handle so it is easy to hold under running water. I know people think it is pricy, but it comes with extra blades and lasts much longer than regular disposables. Give it a try 
I bought this razor and was amazingly impressed with the results! The tilting head makes it easy because it conforms to your different body shapes. The triple blade works great even when I don't put any shaving cream on my legs. Awesome razor! I'd recommend it to anyone! : 
I didn't want a fountain pen I could flaunt, I wanted one that works. This one is great. I'm very pleased 
The fountain pen is well balanced and has an elegant look to it that is both modern and yet timeless. The only drawback is I would have preferred a finer Nib - the Med Nib flows nicely and is very even and never skips but would have liked a finer line. Too bad it was not offered as an option 
Recently purchased this pen and I am absolutely loving it. Starts smoothly every time, writes amazingly well. It looks every bit as beautiful as it does in the pictures. The medium nib lays a fairly heavy line, at least with the Cross/Pelikan black ink. I prefer my pens this way. One comment...This is a thin pen, at least by fountain pen standards. Some people complain that thinner pens cause hand fatigue/cramping more quickly, but this is strictly a personal opinion. I like the slimmer body. The Cross ATX is a comparable pen with a slightly wider body -- also a great pen 
I am traveling from china for training. I purchase this pen for may Mother-in-law. She is a teacher. The stuff looks very beatiful. I like it. 
Reviewed using the Cross converter and Waterman Florida Blue ink: On inexpensive copier paper, this pen's medium point writes smoothly and wet, and has never skipped. It starts instantly after days capped, and is weighted and sized perfectly for an adult man, with an excellent grip. The converter is screw-in, a safety deal all converters should use. The section and barrel threads are metallic finished - if not all metal - with the threads not too loose or fine. The very slight closed-cap looseness doesn't effect performance. Posted, it looks much more expensive than it is, at current Amazon prices! Lifetime warrantee. 
I was a little hesitant to order a colonge without smelling it but I generally like any fragrance by Calvin Klein. I was very happy with Contradiction it has a very pleasant scent that is not overwhelming 
This curling iron is perfect. It heats quickly and has a sturdy design that does not pull hair out. Delivered within two days of order. Highly recommended 
This curling iron is the best on the market with its Teflon coating. It glides over your hair,leaving it with shiny and smooth curls. It never catches or tangles your hair and is super easy to clean 
I really like this dryer. It dries faster than most and does leave my hair softer than my previous blowdryer. It takes a moment or two for it to heat up, but never gets so hot that it would burn me. I love the two attachments and being able to complete 3 types of styles without a problem. The only negative is (as others have mentioned) the "cool" button. It is not uncommon for fingers to rest on it while styling and then all my heat is gone. It does need better usability testing 
This dryer is a bit heavy but it works quickly. I use the attachment to blow dry my hair without blowing it all over my face. It is one of the best and fastest dryers we have used. I would reorder the same dryer if needed. 
This hair dryer never feels hot, even on the high setting and my hair never feels dry...which means frizz will appear later. The switches are impossible to operate if you have even the slightest amount of hair product on your fingers. Instead of taking half the time to dry, it takes much longer than my previous $19 blow dryer - with or without the ionic switch on. Also it's awkward to hold because the "cool" button is located right where your thumb should naturally go so you have to cramp your hand unless you want to be blown cool. Not a good product. I plan to return mine and try something else 
wow i had no idea id be saying this but after reading the reviews when i purchased this item, and after i received and used it for more than 2 weeks now... they werent kidding! this thing dries ur hair really well and fast without leaving it dry!!! my hair looks healthy and soft throughout the whole day. a must-buy if ur looking for a hair-dryer 
I'm very happy with this hairdryer. It's much quieter than my old Conair hairdryer that's about 5 years old. Also, it dries my hair much faster and tames the frizzies. I have thick wavy hair that takes forever to dry. I live in a humid climate, so trying to keep the frizzies under control is very important. I've noticed that my hair is much smoother using this dryer versus the non-ion hair dryers. My only complaint is the weight...it's a bit heaver than my old drier...good thing it dries my hair quickly 
I really like this hairdryer. As others have said, it's quite powerful and it makes my hair less frizzy that others I have used. With my old dryer, it would take at least 10 minutes to dry my short hair. With this one, I have knocked off at least 3 minutes. I know it doesn't sounds like a huge difference, but trust me, when you are in a hurry, it matters! They only thing I don't like about this dryer is the weight. My arm gets tired before I am finished drying me hair. Maybe I just need to work out more 
I brought this dryer for my wife and she really likes it. It dries the hair quickly. The thing that I like about it is the low noise level compared to her previous dryer, which sounded like a jet plane about to take off. Highly recommended 
Amazon asked me to review it because I ordered it. However, I never received it since it seems to be permanently out of stock. So I ended up canceling my order. NOTE. I have a 5 year old almost identical OxyJet irrigator which is excellent although I had to repair its leaking plastic tube. I also have the same toothbrush which is excellent too. NOTE. I also had about half a dozen other oral irrigators. OxyJet is by far the best. NOTE. Ultrasonex is a better toothbrush. It's hard to find these days 
I have used many different oral irrigators and a couple of electric toothbrushes. I wasn't to particular at this point. Then my boyfriend was told he had to have "scaling and planing" to correct his gum disease and we both freaked. We knew that we had to improve our program. We did the research. After reviewing and reading and asking around, we come up with the Oral B 8900. The battery operated brush seems very much like the Sonicare unit in its effectiveness. The selling point of this particular unit is the water jet. It is awesome and I recommend it to anyone. The settings of pressure are from 1 to 5...I have always maxed out oral irrigators in the past and never found much to get excited about. With this unit I have yet to go over a 3 and may in time work up to a 4 or 5 level, but only with consultation with my hygenist. The unit also come with a tongue cleaner that is attached to the battery unit. Much easier to use that manual cleaners. All in all, my boyfriend just spent over 4K and some VERY unpleasant days in periodontal agony. I am sure this little unit will keep me out of the surgeons chair and my boyfriend wants to be sure never to end up with gum disease again. "an once of prevention......" 
I've had about a half dozen Oral B irrigation/toothbrush devices over the years and this one is the best yet. The spray diffusion and force are powerful, while the toothbrush appears very effective. I'm very happy with it. 
I have used various oral irrigation products for over twenty years and the Oral B OxyJet DLX 8900 is by far the best 
Makes a nice at home unit. Too large as a travel monitor. Easy to use and read 
I was looking for a blood pressure monitor for my parents, who are both 85. This model has large, easy-to-read numbers and is fairly easy to use. It is fast and accurate. I would recommend it, especially if two people are going to be using the same monitor. It's also helpful that it records the heart rate and any irregularity 
This is the best arm monitor I have used. I check my pressure often, and sometimes it can actually be uncomfortable to take a reading. This monitor came with clear instructions, took a quick reading, and was not uncomfortable at all. The armband fits well and it is east to take the whole case around with me. I plan to bring it to my next doctor's appointment so I can compare the readings, but I have not had anything out of the ordinary for me using this monitor. I definitely give this product an A 
I am younger, and needed a good monitor to keep tabs on my blood pressure. I don't need the large digits, but they make it much easier to read and they are pretty handy. I use it on a weekly basis and have been impressed with the readings, and it is easy to use. I have a lot of experience with blood pressure machines, so I know how to use them, but the instructions would be helpful for someone who has no idea how to get started. A great purchase 
I got this as a gift for Father's Day, and it is great so far. It is easy to use, and even easier to read. I am getting old, so the larger numbers make it much easier to see on the screen. I have been using it everyday and the readings seem accurate, plus it has a memory so it records my measurements so I can keep track of them. I think this is a great machine. 
I have severe arthritic deterioration in my thumb joint, and the heavier models are too stiff for me. I like this model, and I've bought quite a few of them. My main complaint with this model is that the edges on the fabric aren't finished, and it gets funky looking pretty fast 
I've been using this for years. You only need the smallest amount, and it never fails to deliver an incredible sheen that makes my hair look alive, without making it stiff or sticky. I also find the scent great, something very important to me. If the scent was unpleasant, I couldn't use it, no matter how good it was 
this product fits my lifestyle perfect. i think it does a wonderful job, but definitely for face, bikini and other small areas. if you are not use to waxing or tweezing the area you plan to use it on, then of course that area will be sensitive, and may be a bit painful, but if you already tweeze and wax, then it is not painful what so ever. 
This product works great on the face, and any other small area. Also great for traveling and little touch ups... Totally recomend it, but if you can't take some pain then this is not for you. It does hurt a little bit in the begining but after a while you get used to it. 
I have been using an old Braun epilator for years, and recently lost it. Thank goodnes, or I would have never tried the Emjoi AP-9LC Epi Slim Compact Epilator. I absolutely love this this thing. I use it on my upper lip and chin and it leaves your skin so soft. Can't wait to try it on my underarms. 
A few years ago I spent over $1500.00 to have the hair on my chin lasered. Less than a year later all of the hairs were back (I have about 30). I am of latin decent so the hair is dark and thick (each individual hair).I have been plucking for years and I hate because the hairs grow at different times; hence I am always frustrated with the ones that are too short to pluck. The tweeze was wonderful, it did not hurt, it was fast and it did pull all the hairs from the root. My face is so smooth! Hurray!!! I have only had it 4 days and so far no hair regrowth. Usually I would be able to feel new growth by now. Thanks Tweeze for solving an embarrassing problem 
I've been having waxing for removal of facial hair and this is much better and I can do it myself. The directions are easy to follow and it's easy to clean. It will pay for itself as I no longer have to pay for waxing. The older I get, the less hair I have on my legs and more on my face. This helps me to feel more confident without wondering if someone can see the ugly facial hairs. Thanks 
I think I'm addicted to Burberry fragrances! I got a sample sprayer of this with an order from a beauty supplier, and not having worn perfume for over 10 years, I was like a kid at the candy counter with this. I ordered this for myself for my birthday, and could hardly contain myself from opening it early. It's soft enough to wear on the job, and sexy enough to wear to bed. I got a mini set of 5 Burberry fragrances, and frankly, I'm on a quest to obtain all of the full sizes! Great price here and free shipping is always a bonus! Thanks Amazon 
I really like this scent. It's light and feminine. Also, I like the price. You get a pretty big bottle for the price. 
Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker? Okay. Think "Carrie" on TV's enormously successful "Sex and the City." She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, "Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker." It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in, and enjoy wearing. The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine. Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion. - Gail Cooke 
This scent is one of my all time favorites. It's very light with a musk undertone that is very feminine. I haven't met one person who doesn't like the scent, although one of my friends said it gives her a headache when she wears it. I highly recommend this to any woman who likes clean, fresh fragrances that can be worn day or night 
Aside from the lightening fast shipping, I must rave over this scent! Initially, I knew I loved this perfume (before my Amazon purchase) from a sample ad in a magazine. In December, while walking through a department store with my boyfriend, I decided to test the fragrance and gather his opinion. He didn't seem interested at the time, so I delayed making a purchase. A few weeks ago I finally broke down and ordered it through Amazon. I have already run through 1/4 of the bottle, as my boyfriend LOVES it! Yea 
Lovely is subtle, yet memorable. It doesn't smell like all the other scents out there,either. It lasts all day. LOVE this. 
Exactly as discribed, wonderful aroma, my wife loved it. Shipping quicker than expecte 
This is a well-blended, complex, layered fragrance. It is quite heady going on, and you only need to use a very light spritz. It lasted all day without changing character. This is probably because its a parfum spray, not eau de toilette. This sized bottle should last a long time. Perfumes are very subjective, but I really liked the scent. You can still smell a lingering fragrance on your skin after having a shower. Its definitely a classic style rather than contemporary - think Chanel rather than J Lo or Brittney. Overall, I think its one of the best new perfumes out. I bought this direct from Amazon - great price, and buying direct from Amazon I know I will get the real thing, not a knock-off. I don't have the same confidence in other online stores, whether they sell through Amazon or not. I have bought from some well-known online perfume stores in the past and been sent imitations or old stock - ugh. It has made me very cautious about where I shop. Some fakes are obvious but other ones are very clever and you can only detect the imitation if you are already familiar with the product 
Five Stars doesn't do this fragrance justice. It is the most amazing scent, fresh, light, and clean.( In my opinion everything a fragrance should be) It is truly Lovely... 
This is a classic fragrance, not your overpowering J-Lo, B'Spears, etc. I wish I could explain the scent...but it is tough to describe. It isn't fruity or flowery. Perhaps a bit of lavendar though? Basically, you don't overpower a room with it. It has a bit of an "old-world"-ness to it...but as far as I am concerned, that is a wonderful thing. I am a 31 year old professional, I wear it daily and out at night, and I just love it. 
Just got it but am very impressed. I love the timer, and I love how clean my teeth feel! Keep in mind that I've never used an electric toothbrush, though, so I'm not sure how it compares to more expensive models 
Best deal around. Have paid much more for a similar product. As advertised 
This item seems to work every bit as well as the much more expensive Oral B power brushes. I see no reason to spend $50 -$90. The even more expensive sonic brushes may be worth it, but this one does a great job 
Leaves your teeth feeling smooth, just like after a dentist's cleaning. Makes brushing your teeth easier and fun. Gets into the difficult to reach places, like behind your upper last molars near your throat. I'll never go back to manual brushing. 
This is a great brush for the price. I really like the timer. It keeps me brushing for a full two minutes. 
It's great to not have a tired arm after brushing my teeth. And in less than a quarter of the time it gets off the sticky film that i have when i'm lazy about brushing my teeth. It's so good that i don't feel bad when i don't floss daily. I'm saying way too much about my dental habits aren't i? It also has a useful feature that signals when you are done brushing (at around 2 minutes it jumps on and off a couple times) which helps make sure that i get my whole two minutes in. The charge lasts enough not to be annoying. But every couple of days you have to test it out and listen for whether it's rotating as fast as the day before. 
I bought this power toothbrush mainly because of its price, less that $20. It's the first power toothbrush that I've had since I was a kid, now 30 something. Basic in operation and cleaning the 2 minute timer is also a nice feature 
I have tried it all and this is the only product that has worked for me. I came across Acnefree while traveling through the U.S. last November and I have to say it is the best investment I ever made for my skin. I normally don't have the patience for a beauty regime that involves more than a couple of products so when I saw 4 items in the package I was skepticle whether I would stick to following the routine. It really is very simple to use and doesn't take more than a few minutes to apply after the skin has been cleansed. I would say within a couple of days after commencing use of the products my breakouts were reduced to almost nil and shortly thereafter the problem was completely cleared. My skin is still somewhat oily by the end of the day but my pores no longer get blocked. Thank you University Medical for making a product that actually delivers on its promise, is very reasonably priced and has given me the beautiful complexion I have tried for years to attain. 
ok, i must warn you that i may sound like an infomercial, but i am hooked on this product for my acne problems. i have tried proactiv, murad, another acne kit that i can't think of the name in addition to separate topicals (e.g. noxzema, clearasil, etc.) and none have given me the results that this product gives. i have even tried the milder version of the acne free system and didn't have as good results as i get with the severe acne free system. i wouldn't recommend this product for those with dry or sensitive skin and acne. this is a very drying formula that works on my very oily face. i never thought of my acne as severe, but i would always have a big zit in one place or another on my face that would leave big scars after the zit went away. now, i have not had a breakout since using this product (3 months). i hope it works for you! 
First off I want to explain that I have had terrible acne off and on (mostly on though) for the past 8 years. I had to be put on Accutane my sophmore year for 6 months in high school and then again my freshman year of college for another 3 months. I have been struggling ever since then and needed an alternative to dermatoligist bills and prescriptions for acne treatment. I was having extremely painful and frequent breakouts in the later half of last year and in early November I happened to stumble upon this product. I had my doubts because I had already given Proactiv a couple of tries in the past. The first week of using the 4 products in the package my face became EXTREMELY dry! At first I was worried because it would always be a little red and irritated for the first hour or two after going through the routine. However, within 4 days ALL of my blemishes (big and small) had cleared up! Within a couple of weeks my skin even became smoother, softer, and more even-toned. Trust me, if you have problem skin and want to try something new, this product is definitely worth a shot! Also, I love that you can buy this in pretty much any Walgreens and Walmart so it's very convenient...no waiting for it to be delivered. I purhased mine at Walmart for $20-something in November 2006 and still have more than half remaining of each product in the pack. Thank you University Medical for making an affordable product that actually works! Best of luck to all of you who are struggling with acne...and don't mark this one off your list 
I ordered to two pack bundle and in each pack, two of the batteries were dead. I am even using the Juice Family Charger, so it isn't a brand problem. The packaging was a little beat up as well as if they were sitting around for a long time. Sort of dirty. Also purchased D batteries as well and that packaging was worse. Hard to knock the fact they are made in China because let's admit it, pretty much everything you buy is made in China. The problem is the poor quality control from the company Juice Battery themselves. These are actually ok batteries if they work, but not worth the price especially when taking the chance on whether they will arrive beat up or DOA. Even though still most likely made in China, stick to the main well-known brands instead of this junk 
The charge time was quick and the charged batteries sustained their charge well for reasonable period of time 
Hefty Gripper Bags do just what they are designed to do and they do it very well. We own a bullet-style trashcan that is smooth and these are the only bags that do not slide down inside it. That holds true even when you lift the lid off of the can. Great product 
I hated how the bags edges would fall into the trash can when you put the first few items in the trash. I hated digging the trash bag out of the trash can. With the gripper, no longer a problem! 
They are garbage bags, so how worked up can you get 
These trash bags fit my trash can perfectly. They arrived promptly after placement of my order 
Naturally, "best garbage bag" is a title that is completely debatable. Because a 45 gallon garbage bag may be the best for contractors and this bag worthless for them. But if you are looking for a 13 gallon kitchen-type garbage bag, this one seems to fit my garbage can bill to a T. The drawstring is flexible and holds the bag right in place. It also is sturdy when tying the bag off to dispose of the kitchenly mess. The bag itself is also very sturdy. I buy these in bulk in case Hefty ever decides to discontinue the model 
I find these trash bags to be extremely useful. They really do "grip" well; I no longer have any trouble with the bag falling into the can when I add something heavy. As long as you use a standard tall kitchen trash can with a lip, it should work just fine. The only beef I have with this bag is that when I tie it with the cinched-up ties, it doesn't completely seal up. There is always a small opening in the center 
That "gripper" feature basically just means the bags will be hard to fit onto your garbage can. The bags seem to tear pretty easily, too 
I love each scent in this box. I change them each time I use humidifier, and I do not need to use any scented candles in my bedroom any more 
This is a nice variety of oils, my favorite is the jasmine though, not sure how much I will use some of the 
I am new to using oils but these have been very interesting. Just a couple of drops do the trick. I especially like the Lavendar. There is enough in the bottles to last a long time. With 6 fragrances there is plenty of variety. Recomend 
I received a set of these oils along with a mister for Christmas. Every one has a unique smell that lasts and lasts. I can't choose a favorite because I really like every one of them. I'm ordering a second set while they are on sale, because I sure don't want to run out! I know you'll love them also 
These oils seem to be higher priced, but when you consider they last SO long, especially when using a mister or with water in a potpourri pot, they will last you a good long while. The scents are all the aromatherapy types. My favorite is Green Tea, it has a clean smell to it. Also,the scents linger long after the mister or pot is turned off. I am always getting compliments on how nice my house smells. When you consider Glade and/or candles cost so much and last such a short time, these oils are an even better bargain. I will order more when mine are gone (in about 4-6 months!) 
I have used this product for a while and find it useful , no hassle of changing filters .Wish they made one with a bigger capacity so it lasts for atleast 12 hours 
I'm so happy with the output. My roommate returned his "bigger one", and bouhgt this one after me. He felt same about great output. It's also quiet. Tank is small and handy but because of the high output, it will not work more than 6 hours with one tank of water. I just shut off it before sleep 
This is the best humidifier I have ever found! I have two of them going almost constantly in the winter months. It refills easily and has no filter. It is quiet and has no annoying light to keep me awake. It goes for many hours. The only drawback might be if you wanted to add something to the water. You use plain tap water. Excellent! 
This is a wonderful item. We have tried every kind of humidifier from tabletop ones to the HUGE multi-tank "whole house" type that have 2-4 large tanks and roll around on wheels. My main problem was that I was the only one strong enough to fill and carry the tanks, so I was on permanemt "water carrier" duty. For the huge ones on wheels I hooked up a hose to the faucet and dragged it to the humidifier to fill it. What a pain! This Kaz personal is by far the best choice. It does have a small tank, but it's so light that my elderly mother or the kids can fill and carry the tank themselves. It's also cheap enough to put one in every room. And it's great for travel; just pop it in your luggage and use it in hotels or wherever. We have 1 in each bedroom, and in the living room, kitchen and office. They last almost 2 years then it will just stop steaming. The larger, more pricey ones last about the same amount of time but are way more expensive to replace. On low setting it will go almost 10 hours so the size really isn't an inconvenience. Kaz used to change the style every year, but hopefully they'll stick with this one. The first Kaz Personal took a 1 Liter plastic bottle instead of a tank. A great idea, but the thinness of the bottle you use affected the steam; too thin walls and the water would run out, too thick and nothing happened. I found myself in supermarkets squeezing bottles as if I was picking a ripe melon. Now the Kaz Personal has its own small tank and it is absolutely the best! 
I have very sensitive skin, so I am always reluctant to try new skin care products. I end up returning too many because of the impact on my skin. This product not only did not irritate my skin, it also helped with minor ingrown hair issues, and was a good moisturizer as well. The scent of the product is minty and manly, in my humble opinion. All in all, the product worked well for me, someone with very sensitive skin 
This baby is great for yanking out those stray and pesky nose hairs.And that bright LED light...I could see all the way up to my brain cavity! YOINK 
i have a lot of fine hairs on my face and this tool helped me see them up close and pluck them out. i am very pleased with this product 
The clock on this product does not work. The light does not shut itself off. These are both things the description said it should do. The only thing it does is stay semi-fogless. This is a rip off, do not buy 
I finally bought a shower mirror.This one works great.The light stays on for 5 minutes and auto shuts off. It has a little razor holder on it and it doesn't steam up! Great Mirror ! 
This was on of the less expensive fogless mirrors I found. The leds are very bright and I like the clock and razor holder. You will need to wash it about once a week to keep it working properly. This is pretty simple just take some hand soap on a washcloth and lightly scrub the surface. Its plastic so use a soft cloth to avoid scratches. I had it for about a year and still haven't had to replace the batteries. I believe this one to be just as good as the more expensive models and would recommend it 
Wow how cool is this I can shower and shave at the same time and not worry about cutting my throat. I love this mirror I only wish I would have bought it years ago 
I think it stayed fogless for two uses. After that, it fogged up like any ordinary mirror - even with using the "special glass cleaner" it came with. Too bad. Total dissappointment. 
I like this heat wrap because you simply tie it on and go about your business. I've had mine for about 6 months now and just 2-3 minutes in the microwave and the heat lasts a very long time and it is not dry heat but a theraputic moist heat just as advertised. I usually use it in the morning when having coffee and the ties are generously long measuring 65 inches from end to end. 
I have quite a few of the Thermalon heat wraps and am very satisfied with them -- good moist heat. I use the one for the back and the one for the neck several times a week. They've improved the waist ties for the back one so they are sturdier. I've given a back wrap to my sister, my father and a girlfriend and they all like it too. P.S. I always wondered if these review were real -- this is my first 
I like this - I can tie it to my waist, adjust it to where it hurts, and keep on going. This type cold pack doesn't seem to be as cold to me as real ice or the gel types, but it is good for its type. When I needed it colder, I held a gel pack on with it 
you'll thank yourself later. It works like magic for us. Every baby is different, but I've heard more "yeys" than "nays" about this. I understand that "Gripe Water" (?sp) is good, too, but we have no experience with this 
At times, this product is a godsend. If your child is fussy and you don't know why, just try it. 
I don't have a beard or a mustache, but use this only for trimming sideburns, back of the neck and ears. This works just great for that when you use it without any attachements. This is the right price for something that you use only occasionally 
My husband really enjoyed this trimmer. For such and inexpensive item it gives great results 
I really like this product. It is a little noisy, but it cut well and the attachments are great. I get a nice cut every use. 
I got this model free with a full trimmer set, it's silver when included with a set. I had the original silver one for about two years before it finally died after extensive use - not a bad lifespan for a free item. The battery cover is held in place by a flimsy plastic tab and if you drop it on the floor it can break. I had this issue, which I solved by taping the cover in place and it didn't bother me at all. This black unit comes with accesories which the free ones do not include - 3 length adjusters, a brush, comb and some oil. The thing I like about this model is that you can use just the clipper part right up against your skin and it will not pinch you unless you are careless. I bought a Remington model and it will cut without a spacer. The attachements are only needed on the Wahl for length variations. Despite it's slight cheapness, it's price and performance make it worth it; the best trimmer I have ever used by far 
I've worn this fragrance for about 3or 4 years now, but they no longer sell it in stores. I was extremely excited to find it on Amazon and for a really decent price as well. Shipping was fast, I chose the free shipping and that can sometimes take up to a month but I recieved my package within a week. So glad to have a full bottle again. I LOVE this fragrance 
Like the original Eternity, Eternity Purple Orchid is a sweet-smelling scent, but it is much more flowery than its parent fragrance. Upon initial application, the Purple Orchid has an intense floral bouquet that is a bit strong for my tastes. Over time, however, the scent becomes significantly softer, making the flower notes more subtle and taking on a more powdery, slightly musky quality. This makes Purple Orchid a pretty, muted daytime fragrance, although it might be too delicate for those who prefer a bolder perfume 
The replacement blades are an excellent product. At last I can have a spare set of blades so that when one becomes dirty I can take it out and immediately pop in a clean one. No waiting while the one set completely dries out. The only thing I wish was different is that the top was connected to the blades like the original was. It is separate and is put on after the replacement blades are inserted 
The replacement blades work very nice to provide uninterrupted ionic air cleaning. The replacement blades actutally are shinner then the original blades and are much easier to clean. I usually run my ionic pro with the replacement blades and when they are dirty I put the original blades in long enough to clean the replacement blads properly, then put the replacement blades back in. 
After many years of using the Braun "straight blade" electric razor, I was very pleasantly surprised by how well and easily this shaved. My only disappointment is that there's no LED display for when the razor's power is low--it just stops. I still hate to shave, but for the $70 I paid for this, its great and I highly recommend it 
THIS IS THE BEST RAZOR THAT I'VE SHAVED WITH SINCE I BEEN SHAVING. I'M 54 YEARS OLD. SO DOD THE MATH. IT'S WELL WORTH THE MONEY AND I WILL BUY This razor again 
For $70, this is a great electric shaver. Before I bought this one, I was using a basic Norelco for seven years. The Spectra is better since it gives you a closer shave, recharges quickly, and because you can use water to clean it. And in terms of appearence, the blue and silver looks nice 
I am very happy with the close shave from this shaver, my previous shaver was a Braun and this gives me a closer shave in less time. It is also very quiet in operation. My only knock is that the owners manual says that the charger needs to be unpluged after charging is complete. This is quite inconvient. 
This is my chance to see if the reviews you read here are from real people that got the product.. :) I got this shaver a month ago.. I was using a regular wet razor and got tired of having to run to work with a piece of toilet paper so I could clean the blood coming out of my face. It was also a pain in the butt having to spread the shaving cream, and then get rid of it every day. Now I am using the Spectra and I'm very happy with it. The instructions tell you to give up to 3 weeks for your face to get used to the new shaving system. But in my opinion, it is just a way for them to make you LEARN first how to use the machine. I did not notice any differences in the skin or shave after the "getting used to" period compared to the first day I used the Norelco. But I do not mean that there is no difference in the skin. You feel the skin a lot better and softer after the fist shave with this system vs. the razor. I am still learning how to get the best shave with it. I have shaved my face to the point that I got a CLOSER shave than the razor a few times. And other times I get a just OK shave, but not as close as before. I think it depends on how the hair reacts to the machine any given day. Sometimes I spend more time to get the same results as other days. But no more than 5 minutes. I always used it in normal mode. This way it is supposed to be the fastest. My tip to you would be this: The instructions tell you to shave with your face clean. But if you shave right after taking your daily shower, is like your face gets humid and less slippery for the Norelco. I had better results with my face really dry. So I clean my face the night before and shave when I wake up, before taking my shower. This way I have my face clean and really dry. Sometimes you have to make more than a gentle pressure with the heads on your face to catch and cut the hair closer. I got some irritation in my lower part of the neck a few times... it is a little difficult to catch the hairs in that area.. may be because the skin is softer in there. The battery last a lot. It is a very practical machine, and comes with a pouch so I can shave the mornings I wake up at my girlfriend's home. No more blood for me. But take care with your lip. Once i catch it a little with the spectra and got a bad feeling in it for a few days. I think that with some more time, I will perfect the technique and always get the shave I want with the Spectra 8825XL. I recommend this machine to anyone. It is great.  Sorry for my bad English.. I speak Spanish. Good luck! 
I have been using a cordless razor for 10 or so years now. This is the worst one yet, and the first one to give me a rash every time I use it. I don't have sensitive skin and it still bothers me on sensitive mode. I am still loking for a replacement for me pre Gillete Braun Razor. It was amazing 
Well this is the first shaving system that I have owned so I cannot compare it with others in the market. But yes definitely this one is really good. It gives a nice shave, easy to handle, easy to clean and absolutely maintenance free. 
I'm almost 50 and have been using an electric razor most of my shaving life. When my trusty Norelco needed replacing, my wife bought me the latest self-cleaning Braun for a Christmas gift. I liked some aspects of it, but it always had a hard time shaving my neck area without going back over it a lot of times. Replacing the cutter and screen every 6 months or so helped keep it from getting progressively worse, but after a couple of years, I thought I would try something different. I read MANY reviews and decided to try the Norelco Spectra system. I've been using it for several months now and I can tell you the difference on my neck is like night and day. The Norelco is MUCH faster and smoother than the Braun and cuts very close after only a couple of passes. I was amazed at how much better it was than even my old triple-head Norelco. If I were to have ANY negative, it would be the charging system. The first problem is, if you provide a recharging "stand", then the logic (IMO) should be that the stand be allowed to be plugged in 24/7 with the razor in it, without any adverse affects. However, MANY places in the manual tell you DOING THIS WILL SHORTEN THE LIFE OF YOUR BATTERY. Because they use a NiCad battery, they ask that you only recharge it when it runs low to avoid the "memory" effect and associated diminished capacity. I can understand that, but the second problem is, it gets fully charged in only 4 hours! After that, you are supposed to remove it from, or unplug, the stand to avoid overcharging. Unfortunately, most of us shave in the morning before a work day, then don't return for at least 9-10 hours. In my case, a 12 or even 24 hour charge would be far more convenient. What's so hot about a "4-hour charge" anyway?? OK, how about I push a button to start the charge cycle, and it automatically shuts off when fully charged! How easy is that? (Gee, that's exactly how my Braun worked.) Being an Electrical Engineer myself, I'm sometimes overly critical of things like this. OK, if it were me, (are you listening Norelco???) I would have used a NiMH battery that didn't have to be "deep cycled", then use a lower current "trickle charge" base that could be left on 24/7. A side benefit is when you pack for a trip and grab your razor, you KNOW it's always 100% charged and will probably have enough juice to last the entire trip without dragging the charger along. OK, maybe the charger is not as bad as I make it out to be. I just think it could be better. I give it 3 stars, while the razor itself gets a full 5 stars 
My Electric Shaver was everything I wanted. I saved so much money, great service, great product, and got here quicker than expected.. Thank you, I'll shop with you again.. 
Worked as advertised. Baby does not seem to mind it at all. 
By far the best thermometer I have ever used. I wish I had had this when my boys were little. I don't even bother with the ear or under arm versions with my little girl - such a waste of time and you always doubt the accuracy. So simple. So fast. There isn't a chance that this thermometer can be inserted too far. EXCELLENT product. I highly recommend this to all my friends 
As a new Mom I was so afraid to take my baby's temperature...that I might hurt her or put it in too far. Then I saw this thermometer and couldn't get over how easy it was to use. I have found it to be very accurate. I have purchased this for two baby showers since buying it for myself. It gives great peace of mind 
After 6 straight nights in the ER with our daughter having 104+ fevers we asked the nurse if we could check the accuracy of ours when they took her temp, it was exact. The hospital grade thermometer took longer and gave the same results. The Vicks Baby Rectal Thermometer was even used while she slept and it did not disturb her while we still received an accurate temp for her vital sign check. Great product and recommend it to all, only wish it was more readily available especially overseas. 
This is the best, fastest rectal thermometer on the market. It's accurate, safe (you literally can't insert it too far), and VERY fast. I've used five other rectal thermometers, some of which cost much more than this one, and I have to say that this one is the best. Look no further 
I have other thermometers that I was using until one day they gave a normal reading and my daughter was burning up and I knew she had a fever. I used this thermometer, which confirmed that she did have a fever... so easy to use. Just put some vaseline on the end and you can not insert it too far. I think the package actually says it takes longer to get a reading than it really does... it was very fast! I have no problem buying more expensive products when they work, but don't waste your money on $50 thermometers... they are not accurate! This one is great and the doctors want you to take a rectal reading anyway!! 
I own this thermometer, the braun ear thermometer and a safety first thermometer. This one is by far the best. It is the perfect size and fit in your hand, and there is like no chance of inserting it too far. It gives a quick accurate reading and really just works so good. the safety first one works but is long and skinny, alittle scary putting in a babies behind! Ane I have to be honest I have never used the ear thermometer because generally the DR. wants a rectal because it is the most accurate and they say the ear thermometers are really hard to use, so I wouldn't recommend wasting the money on it. Get this one, you won't be sorry 
I originally bought this item to use as a tub cushion while I sit in the tub giving my infant a bath, but it is wonderful, very comfortable and great for just relaxing in the tub yourself, It could also be used as a regular seat cushion if you so choose. I like it very much 
I've used these Aquis towels before, and I purchased this one due to the size - previously they were only available in small sizes. This is body size, and to my surprise, the surface feels better so that it doesn't "snag" your skin as you rub it. And it still does its job - making you dry. 
I really like these towels! The are very soft and large. The off white is a nice color too 
this is the top of the line. easy to install, but pricey. does the job., PLUS..It is really BIG SHOWER PRODUCT. 
Installation of this shower head is a little tricky. The head and arm are *heavy* so extra plumber's tape at the joint between the arm and the pipe that comes out of the wall in needed is order to avoid leaks. In comparison with the rain-pour shower head that I had, water pressure of this showhead is awesome! I agree with a previous review on the point that the pulsating rain is a little lame. However, the fact that the shower head is made of plastic keeps the water hot. I've noticed a significant difference in the temperature of my morning shows! I recommend this product 
THIS ITEM SAYS THAT MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS 180/123, WHICH MEANS I SHOULD BE DYING, AND AT THE DOCTOR OFFICE MY PRESSURE IS 120/68 
The HoMedics BPW-200 Smart Sense Automatic Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor works every time without giving us any frustrating error messages. It's super easy to switch from one user to another and the graphic displays are easy to read and very intuitive for the user(s). Nice appearance, well made, and seems very reliable for accurate blood pressure readings. We are extremely well satisfied and highly recommend the product 
Remarkably accurate! I have only found two wrist BP monitors which have provided accurate results time and time again. Being a hospice nurse I try to inflict as little discomfort as possible to my patients. This monitor has detected a BP when my arm cuff was unable to do so. This will be my second purchase of this model and brand because my 91 y/o grandmother swiped the first one. :- 
Unit fits on the wrist easily. Minimal steps required, which my 84-year old mother appreciates 
I can honestly say that these are the only tweezers you will ever need. I have 900 other pairs and when I misplace these, my eyes well up with tears at the thought of losing them. As a freelance makeup artist, I do A LOT of eyebrow grooming. These tweezers are WONDERFUL and VERY precise. I can reach microscopic hairs, that you can only see in a 10X lighted and magnified mirror, with these babies. These tweezers are also fantastic for splinters, ingrowen hairs, and tackling zits (which you shouldn't be doing . . . tsk tsk). Be careful! They're sharp 
I bought this after advice from a curly hair forum, in that it speeds drying and therefore cuts down on frizz. I will agree it does seem to speed drying time for hair when it's wrapped in this, but it feels terrible against the skin. This is not the kind of towel one would want to use for anything but hair. When you touch it (and any microfiber towel for that matter), it feels like your skin is very, very dry because it catches on every fiber. It soaks of water from hair and dries quickly afterward when I hang it over the side of the tub. It would help if it were a little bit wider, but this size seems to be the standard 
This and the Aquis hair turban are the first microfiber towels I've tried. I'm very impressed! This 19 x 39 inch towel is way way way more than enough for toweling off after a shower. Plus it dries out very quickly hanging it over the towel bar. True, it's not a towel you can really wrap yourself up in, but it sure will save on space in the washer and dryer! I will definitely be buying more Aquis towels 
Lounger looks like it was used. Looks like stains from tanning lotion 
I absolutely love this lounger. It is the most comfortable one I've ever owned, and the design allows me to lie face down without smashing my nose or twisting my neck. I can even read while lying face down. The pillows can be arranged to fit my individual needs and are held in place by velcrow. I have a little trouble folding the lounger up single-handedly, but that's okay. The great features outweigh this minor annoyance. 
I had been using a regular razor for years but with the price of blades figured something like this would be worth it, and when I saw this on sale for 50 bucks I jumped on it. I have only used it twice and have already noticed a closer shave, so I highly reccomend this razor! 
We received the razor in great condition. I gave it to my boyfriend for Christmas and it took some time to get it started, because we didn't want to miss something, but he has used it everyday and really likes it. The shave is smooth. It took time to get used to it because he couldn't feel it working 
I bought this for my son for college and here are his comments: "The razor works great. It's the closest shave I have been able to obtain with an eletric razor. The cleaning base is a great idea, because it does all the work for you, and the only thing you have to remember is to put it on the base. My only complaint is that on my base the male plug broke off. It was probably just a random chance accident that it happened with mine. They are repairing it now and I am supposed to have a new unit soon, so Phillips was good about that. All in all a very great razor, especially for the sale price of $50!" 
I like the quietness of the shaver, the closeness of the shave, and the lightness of the razor. Also, I like the larger holding area for the whiskers. I don't like not being able to buy the solution locally, or even on the Norelco website. I don't know what I'll do when I run out of solution 
Dear Amazon, I am happy with the purchase I made of the Body Bare triple combo pubic area shaver. Once I got the hang of using it and following the directions it is so easy to use and works really well. My pubic hair is gone. I feel more confident in my love making and my hubby says I look sexy with no hair. I would recomend this item to everyoen 
I bought this shaver not long ago and I really like it. Where can you find a good shaver for this amazing price. 
Great price on a good shaver. This replaced my other Braun shaver that was several years old. I had gotten many years of service from the old one. I like the guard that protects the screen and on/off button. I travel a lot and have had my old one get turned on in travel and be dead when I arrive. It won't happen with this one due to the design on the guard 
Bought this as a replacement for an earlier rechargeable Braun. Fantastic. Very close shave. 3 weeks on one charge! 
I bought this razor to check out the foil shave. I've used Norelco and Panasonic shavers before. I have dermatitis and break out easily. This is the first of the electric razors that I've come across that gave me a great, close shave and didn't break me out. This razor was great but I really wanted a little more. So I looked up the Braun 8995 and got everything in one package. This is a great shaver for a graduate or somebody getting a start in life. It definitely turned me on to the foil shaver. This is the best. But when you're ready for a razor that takes care of itself, go on and get a Braun 8995 
I found that I could not get a close shave, if I was working I would have to shave later in the day to get by. Luckily I am retired so no problem. I also cannot cut some of the beard on the lower part of my neck and have to use the trimmer to cut any long hairs. Not as good as my old Norelco. 
I wanted an electric for afternoon shaving. Something faster than the good old blade. For that this works very well. An afternoon shave makes to morning shave a lot easier and faster. Blades stay cleaner and less likely to nick. Price represents a good value. The only area the shaver seems to have problems is the back of the jaw just below the ear. Knowing that I can compensate. Easy to clean. Battery has lasted weeks. Fit in either hand is very comfortable. Overall a great little shaver for price. Tip for blade users, try using shave soap and a brush in place of stuff in a can. A better shave and a lot less expensive, don't forget to put a little water in the cup AFTER your shave so it does not dry out 
I've used the standard Gillette blade for almost 40 years but for medical reasons had to switch to an electric. The Braun is wonderful. Almost as close as a blade with no nicks or scrapes. And it saves on shaving supplies 
I think this works well - it's got the 3 settings, with one changing into the other gradually. It's great being higher up and long cord, and inexpensive and WAY better than the standard apt showerhead that Post supplied. Only wish it had water saver on it 
I was at my brothers house and loved the waterpik showerhead he had even though it was not hand held. I searched the web for something similar that was hand held. Found this one and it is great! It works wonderful on rinsing out long hair and great for washing the shower tiles. I do find the handle to be a bit uncomfortable from time to time, but it really is no big deal. My boyfriend loves it as well. 
We bought the chrome model as a replacement for a basic no-frills showerhead. Showers feel pretty good on the regular setting, and the massage setting is decent too. The showerhead was easy to install and everything was included except for teflon pipe tape which we found necessary to prevent leaks when we screwed this into the main plumbing. When the head is resting in the cradle, it arches up a few inches, which makes it nice for tall people to be under. The hose is also plenty long enough to reach to the other end of the tub. The problem we had is that the showerhead does not fit snugly into the cradle, unless we unnaturally force it. Just setting the showerhead in the cradle results in the showerhead moving when the water is turned on, mostly because the hose still has curl in it. He solved this problem with 2 hair clips to hold the hose still. One word of caution -- if you unscrew the swivel piece, be careful not to lose the rubber ring, because it falls out easily. Without it, the swivel leaks badly. All things considered, I would buy this product again, and would suggest it as long as it is going to be used solely as a hand-held showerhead or solely as a cradled showerhead. Switching back and forth may cause frustration 
This, obviously, is Waterpik's "econo" hand-held showerhead. I have been using their showerheads for at least 15 years, and can see no difference in quality between this one and its higher-priced siblings. Apparently, merely by limiting the number of settings to 3, Waterpik can hold the price down to a fraction of what their more expensive models fetch. For me, its perfect. I noticed with the previous model that I owned, that I used only the regular spray, the pulsating massage and, occasionally, the combination setting. That is precisely what the JM-351 offers. Why pay more for settings I don't use? The regular spray is a pleasant, refreshing "needle" type spray that provides a good flow of water even for rinsing shampoo out of hair. The massage provides a forceful pulsation that actually does massage! In fact, it is so forceful that you need to careful where you point it. But for a sore shoulder or a spasming back, its great. The combination setting is continuous - that is, as you rotate the head from spray to massage, you gradually get less spray and more massage. The JM-351 has a curved handle, which is not typical of Waterpiks from what I can tell. This yields one advantage and one disadvantage. Because the handle has a pronounced curve, if you tilt the pivot ball downward, you can get the spray to point straight down. This permits you to easily step out of the water spray while you soap up, shave or whatever. With my old straight-handled model, this was not possible. Unfortunately, the curve also makes the handle slightly less comfortable to hold than if it was straight - especially with soapy, slippery hands. Not a big problem, but noticeable enough to make it worth mentioning. Installation hint: Waterpik is very good about maintaining the same size fittings and thread sizes across their entire line and over time. If you are replacing an existing Waterpik, you can replace just the hose and handle, while continuing to use the existing pivot ball and bracket. In fact, if your current hose is in good condition, you could replace just the handle. A 30-second installation! My only (minor) complaint is that after 2 months and 60 hot showers, the hose has not completely relaxed. It still sort of "sticks out" instead of just dangling limply from the bracket the way the old one did. I expect that eventually this will happen. If you are not a "style-monster" who requires a more elegantly appointed showerhead, and if you need only the basic spray and massage patterns, this is your showerhead. Highly recommended 
It is easily installed and works well but could be not so heav 
I have been using this product for about a week and have noticed a big difference already. I am 28 and have just one or two creases around my eyes that I am working on fading, and also as a preventative. This stuff works, and I will be trying other Roc products in the future. 
I have been using this cream for about two weeks or longer and to be quite honest, I don't see any change at all. I am very disappointed and would not buy this product again 
I've been using the RoC line of products for over 10 years now, and it seems to be working so far. I don't have wrinkle under my eyes nor crow's feet. My friends thought I was 10 years younger than I actually am. : 
This product makes using the Norelco HQ171 electric razor much more comfortable and allows a far more comfortable shave without skin irritation. I would highly recommend this electric razor as well. The gel cartridge is very easy to install and remove. 
I have a Norelco razor that uses either shaving lotion or shaving gel. My personal preference is the gel. As I get older, I need more moisturizing and the gel helps provide it 
I have used this product for approx. 3 years now as I much prefer it to the lotion. It works better for me as I have a heavy beard and it greatly reduces irritation. I will use this product until I either change razors or they make something better 
This product is preferred more than the lotion for the recipient of this gif 
The razor was a perfect buy, worked perfectly! Would suggest as a great gift during the holidays!!!! 
Everytime I purchase this product it never fails me when I have to shave. It is a great smelling aroma, and it is smooth on the face 
I tried this product and then bought 3 packages more, because I felt it was an great product. I rate this as an excellent product 
The gel works great and allows you to moisturize the face for a close shave. 
The cashew cookie larabar is my favorite. It's nice to have an all natural non-processed bar that isn't stuffed with extra vitamins. The taste is simple and delicious. Works well for breakfast or a snack on the go. I didn't like the other flavors as well. 
Great tasting bar. Nice and soft make it easy to eat 
Yum, yum, yum. Tart and chewy goodness. 310 calories per bar, however. Eh, who cares 
Wow. These are unlike any snack/health bar I've ever had. Cocoa Mole' is such a great flavor- nice and chocolatey with a kick of chili pepper- works great as a mid-morning snack! I like almost all the other Larabar flavors- except the banana which is kind of bland. Can hardly wait to try the Key Lime Pie and the Pistachio flavors. I wish these bars were sold in regular grocery stores, it's a long drive to Wild Oats from where I live.. 
Could a bar be any more tasty? These are wonderful. I love the fruit/nut combo. I'll open a package a munch on a little bit at a time just to saver the taste. So far, I've had the lemon, cherry, ginger snap, and a chocolate one and these. I love every one except not a big fan of the chocolate one. And usually chocolate anything is my favorite. I'm very glad I found these. 
i love these bars. i've tried all the flavors and they're all pretty darned great. i eat them more for a snack than a meal because they aren't as filling as i'd like, but they're great for a snack or sugar craving 
its sooo good. yummy, filling, natural. what more could you ask for 
This is a great snack to carry around for those in-between-meal blood-sugar crashes. Also a great healthy alternative to candy bars...the natural dates will satisfy any sweet tooth. It only has a few natural raw ingredients and tastes pretty good too. No preservatives or refined products 
After using these during windstorms and power outages just to light our home, I was so glad I had one of these at school one afternoon when the power went out. The students felt so much safer with this lantern and the light spread out quite a bit in the classroom! The handle makes it very portable for hanging up or carrying around! We plan on purchasing more of this particular lantern! 
These are great for baby meal times, especially when on the road or travelling. No need to cart sticky bibs around or worry about washing them; the bibsters are convenient and do the job well 
I like these for on the go. No trasnporting home dirty food filled bibs. You can use these bibs and toss away. They also have a neat little pocket that catches food bits that drop so the resturant floor isnt full of droppings by the end of the meal! I think all resturants should have these and give them to their patrons 
Great product if you want to lessen your laundry loads. Velcro works with no problem. Maybe a little pricey : 
It is very convenient.I like it very much. Also, it is not very expensive 
I tried a small box of these first, and I loved them. This box with a 4-pack it's great and saves you money. They are perfect because: - You don't have to clean them. Just throw them away. - They are way more comfortable for my baby than vinil or plastic ones. - They have a velcro closing (NO sticky band catching baby's hair). - 2 or 3 of these take almost no space on the diaperbag. - They are big enough to cover her chest and tummy. - Liquids don't get through, so baby's clothes stay dry. - The pocket catches all the food that doesn't make it to the mouth. This is great, specially now that she is starting to eat by herself and only half of the spoons make it to the mouth. The rest just falls in the pocket 
WE LOVE THESE! They're big enough that they catch most everything she drops. They come folded flat and take up no space at all -- great for shoving in your purse. The plastic backing keeps her clothes dry. And when she's done, I take it off and throw it away. Much better than trying to use a napkin. 
This was a gift for my daughter who drives 100's of mile every day. She say it works great 
I gotta admit--the concept is great. AS you drive, you sit on a nicely cushioned seat cover that also: 1. Massages your upper back, lower back, or both, 2. Has an optional heating unit for comfort and warmth, and 3. Plugs into your auto's cigarette lighter. The massage is conducted though 5 vibrating balls located inside the cushion, and therein, literally, lies the problem. The ball located in the center of the upper part of the cushion digs--annoying, uncomfortably, and very noticeably--into your back, rendering the whole massage/comfort angle a moot point. As well as the rest of this works, and it does (the heat is perceptible, the other four balls feel fine, the cushion fits snugly around your seat with a velcro-closed belt), that one protruding ball makes this an uncomfortable experience. I'm taking mine back. On the positive side, the company is just one "point" away from a very good product. If you see this (or something like it), try to "test drive" it at the store. Maybe this company (or others) place the balls in a better position in other products. A few other notes: You cannot turn the heat on independent of the massage; that is, if the massager is not on, you cannot turn the heater on. Also, this is not shiatsu-like massage, not at this price. You're getting an electricity-generated vibration here, at two speeds, low and high. At the high speed, you feel more stimulated than relaxed, as if somehow one of those old vibrating foorball game surfaces were up against your back. In fact, the brief manual accompanying the BK-2500 cautions people against using this at night, as it may keep you awake for a little while. Still, if you like a back buzz, and you find a similar cushion without that very uncomfortable center ball (didn't anyone test this thing?), you might enjoy a product like this. But...not this one. 
If your skin dries out after using Dial or Ivory then this is the soap for you. Also great for shaving face with razor or electric 
This product DOES work if you are otherwise healthy and your hairloss isn't genetic or caused by an underlying medical condition. It could HELP in those cases, but chances are your results won't be great. Also, if you have a condition like a candida albicals overgrowth which stops proper assymilation of nutrients, this can also have a great affect on whether or not they work. I lose hair when I'm stressed. When I'm taking these I notice this doesn't happen and my hair loss in the shower is about 10 hairs. When I'm not taking them it can be up to 40. Yes, I've actually counted the hairs left in the comb!! They also make my actual hair strands thicker and they seem more rooted and strong in the scalp. Anyway, don't let the nay-sayers discourage trying this product. I would have rated this product 5 stars if it weren't so expensive 
My back itches from time to time. Scratching one place often makes the spot next to it itch. Somewhere during this process, it reaches somewhere hard to reach, and you end up looking like a primate. Use tools, feel human. I did, however cut the wheely things off the back end. Pointless, and make the product overly long and awkward. I bought two; one for home and one for work. Best $10 (w/ shipping) I'd ever spent 
This is a great buy. This bottle was $60 more at the department store. It's the only scent I wear, so I'll be buying more at Amazon! lj 
Got this for my mom for a gift. She loved it. The classics are always a good, safe bet when buying a fragrance for others 
Norelco seems to be moving a lot of its production of electric razors to China. I have one made there, and also this one which is still made in Holland. Truthfully, they both seem to work equally well, but there is something nice about having a Norelco from the land that created them. No matter where they're from, they are a pleasure to use 
Old Norelco broke down after 10 ten years. 7180XL is much lighter and smoother shave. It is stylish and easy to handle 
I've had this scale for over 10 days now but I am returning it tomorrow morning. It is not accurate AT ALL 
I am really glad I purchased this item. The weight is very accurate and I love that it gives weight to the tenth of a pound. The body fat was similar to past measures I've had taken professionally. As for water, I tend to get dehydrated, so I wasn't surprised that mine was low, but can't attest to how accurate it is. (Not even really sure what you use that measure for). The setup is fairly easy and the operation is easy for all the information it gives. I would be more user friendly to only have to step on the scale, but I think it's worthwhile to have it store your information. I would never need to track 12 people, but I love that it stores people's information separately. Overall, I think this was a great buy especially for the price and would recommend it to anyone needing a scale that calculates body fat 
It's for my boyfriend...he said it was nice to recognaise real weight, and to decide to reduce his weight... Thanks a lot! 
My husband and I have been using this scale since the beginning of this year and love it! The weight is accurate as I have checked it against my doctor's scale. I can't verify the body fat water percentages, but we track our 3 data readings on a daily chart and can see our progress very easily. For the price, I would definately recommend this scale for anyone wanting to track their weight loss 
I like this scale. It is light. It looks good in my bathroom. It seems accurate. It can memorize height and weight information for multiple users, so that you and your family members can use it to get your percent water and percent fat, in addition to weight 
I've had this scale for 3 months and have had no problems. It seems pretty accurate. My doctor's scale gives the same weight. Not sure why others are having an accuracy problem unless they do not have the scale on a hard floor. No non-bar scale will work accurately on carpet. I ignore the body fat and water because I've been told in several fitness courses at school that there is no way for it to be truly accurate. 
Item slightly different than order but worked just the same. Shipping was turbo charged!! 
Using rechargeables is a MUST if you have kids with battery operated toys, it makes 0 sense (financially or for the environment) to buy throw away alkalines - total waste 
these items arrived on time and as described. Rayovac rechargeabe batteries in the AA and AAA sizes have always worked great for me. They keep their first charge even longer than regular batteries so they sometimes outlast them before even needing a recharge. I wish the larger size rayovac rechargeables were as good performers as the AA and AA 
I am a big fan of the Rayovac Rechargeable Batteries. I primarily use the AA and AAA batteries. We would normally go through a large number of batteries (especially AA) and now we don't. My recharge count continues to grow, I have only had dispose of 1 or 2 batteries. They also tend to be more powerful then the average non-rechargabel AA battery. They are great for Cameras, toys, remote controls, and portable electronics. I have a set for each child and they have to keep track of them and keep them charged. It reallys saves money and hassel. Additionally, I don't have to keep throwing batteries into the trash can, which is great 
I have many digital toys , so these batteries are a life saver. I will never have to buy alkaline batteries again. Fast charging, long lasting, great rechargeable batteries 
Hasta ahora las he estado usando en mi Creative Muvo TX FM y me han servido. Es una lástima que no vengan con mayor amperaje. He visto que las Energizer son mas potentes que estas. Talvez sea porque las Ray-O-Vac salieron primero al mercado.. 
The only thing wrong with it that I can see from my perspective, is that it doesn't hold paperbacks very well. Other than that, it's great! This bookstand should last as long as the last one I had. That one lasted about 25 years 
I was amazed at how well this works, it fits almost any size book and holds it open nicely. Overall great product 
I don't know why that one reviewer had trouble with this bookstand. It's excellent and works on all sizes and styles of books. You simply adjust the position of the arms based on the size of the book and the balance of the pages. It doesn't take long to figure out. Simply try it on a number of different books when you first buy it, until you get the hang of how it works. It's an ingenious design, really. I've tried other bookstands and this is my favorite. This stand combines the convenience of a light and foldable design that's easy to carry with you, while at the same time being able to handle large books as well as small. I highly recommend it 
Unlike the first review of this product, I have found it to be great to take with me whenever I go out to eat. It folds down easily and fits in my purse. I read both paperbacks and hardbacks using the Easi-Reader and have had few problems with it. The only times it seems to slip is when you are just starting or ending a book and most of the pages are on one side of the holder. I always have people coming up to me at my table asking about the holder and I give it a glowing recommendation. I tell them how to track it down on the internet and have no idea how many I have sold for the company. I have orderded more than 20 myself and have given many of them as Christmas stocking stuffers. I also have given many to people who work at the restaurants I frequent as they have asked about the holder and I have used them as tips sometimes. I'm sorry the other reviewer did not find it to be useful but I really like it and as stated previously find it to be excellent for my purposes 
I believe I have a relatively healthy lifestyle so it is difficult to say that any one product made a difference. However, I take the Ultimate Defense along with their Ultimate Florazyme and the Ultimate Meal for 2 meals daily exactly per their directions; breakfast and lunch, and have been doing so for nearly a year now. I highly recommend them. This combination together is the best body fuel I have ever found. And, I have recommended these 3 products to a number of my friends and they too appreciate the quality and effectiveness of them. 
This is a well-balanced cologne. Good notes of spice and wood, noticeable but not overpowering. I am a fan of Burberry. I wore this scent one day when I was wearing a jacket. The next day I was wearing the same jacket, but not the cologne. No kidding, a woman in the grocery store came up to me out of the blue and said that I smelled good 
Even tho this cologne has been out for about 10 years, I really like it and have had others comment on how good I smell :-) Was very pleased with Amazon's price and the quick delivery time 
I purchased this product recently. When it arrived I opened it and stuck it in the microwave to heat it up. You have to keep checking because ya don't want to overheat it as instructions say. Once I used it, I found it really comfortable and the heat lasted for a pretty long time. Having the weight of the seeds in the inner sleeve adds a nice weight/compress. 
It works but the heat only lasts for 30 minutes and you have to wait 2 hours before using the therabead pack. 
I consider myself a bit of a paper products connoisseur, so I was really excited to get a chance to check out the RD (Rapid-Dissolving) technology that Scott has developed. They've been testing it in Japan for a couple years now and I was sadly unable to find anyone to import it some for testing purposes. I guess the FDA hadn't approved it yet or something. In any case, I finally ordered some from Amazon and let me tell you: This is the paper you want to be cleaning yourself with. It's soft, it's unscented (a must as far as I'm concerned. Too many people have allergy problems with scented products), and it's durable enough to stand up to the harshest messes. Another bonus: RD technology is likely to be easier on septic tanks. 
Great quality, convience and price. This is a good way to shop and keep a supply on hand. 
I am very pleased that I found this item on Amazon. And it was received very quickly and will order again when neede 
This fragrance is one of my favorites. It is soft, yet slightly sweet and spicy. It is very sensual. I love it! 
This fragrance is definitely an obsession for me. It is very hard to find and I am so happy I stumbled across it on this website. 
The steam rollers works so great I bought a back up set in the event one breaks. My hair is chemically relaxed and very porous, so I was surprised that the steam rollers worked so well (steam or humidity under normal circumstances turns my hair into a frizzy mess). I recommend using paper ends and to not over fill with water. Hair turns out healthy and consistently soft, smooth, and silky with lots of body. 
I've used the steam setter a couple years ago. when to a steam iron that burns the end of my hair. The Molecuar Steam Setter doesn't do that and is easy to use 
I am African American with relaxed hair. I roll my hair at night, then remove the rollers, and the curls are so strong, they stay overnight, no matter how I toss and turn, this allows me to style my hair the next morning. It is nice not to sleep on rollers. No more burnt hair smell from the curling iron. Relaxed hair must be moisturized to prevent breakage and shedding, these rollers keep my hair moisturized and soft all day and I have noticed how shiny my hair is without my having to use any additional hair products. 
At first I was skeptical because I've always used curling irons in the past. And on top of that, my ventures into hot roller systems weren't wonderful. They were hot for one and bulky. And a set with enough curlers to fit my head took up way too much counter space. Curling irons were an OK alternative for me for many years but it would burn if it was too hot or not curl if it wasn't hot enough. Soon I wasn't doing anything except blow drying... Then I decided to get this set. I've never heard of steam setter before but it sounded like it was worth a try. And I'm so glad I did! It's a mix between sponge curlers and heated curlers so it's pretty comfortable because it's softer and lighter than regular hot rollers. But it still easy to to snap right into your hair. The steam is the secret (I use filtered/bottled water because I'm afraid of having the hard water build up in the unit. I just keep a bottle in my bathroom). You hair can be unstylably dry and it would still curl. Plus the steam leaves your hair soft, just like when you first blow-dry wet hair. I usually put the curlers in before going through my morning make-up routine. You should take them out before you change or if you have a 30 minute car ride, take them out before you leave the house so the curls can loosen up a bit. That's all there is too it. If you want to set with some hair spray...go right ahead! This product comes with a unit that produces steam which has a regular and an ionic mode. I don't know what the difference is except that when it's on ionic mode, it creates more steam and is more noisy. Regular mode is silent. It also comes with lots of rollers in 3 sizes. You can stow the curlers away under the sink or in the closet and just leave the steam unit on your counter (It's about the size of a box of Olay Facial Cloths). You should try it if you want to curl your hair often. Unless you put your hand right up to the steam vent, there is no chance of you burning yourself and the rollers don't get hot enough to damage your hair either. Like all curling products, it takes practice and a couple of trail runs to get the configuration and timing down. Then, it's a piece of cake 
Maybe the people below me who have said the lotion doesn't get warm are using a thicker lotion or something (I use Vaseline Intensive Care), but my lotion is warm to the point of almost being too hot to put on my skin. Since I am always cold, the lotion has to be warm otherwise my skin just turns to goosebumps and I don't get the absorption I need. Since using this my skin has been a lot softer. Great product 
My sister has 2 little boys. She asked for this item to warm up their lotion so it was warm when they got out of the tub. She says it's great! Takes a little while to get warmed up but otherwise great 
My wife loves being able to apply warm lotion now that she has the Conair. It heats up fast and does the job. I got a great deal and it looks nice too. I also would like to thank the Amazon rep who promply helped me resolve a password issue and make the shopping experience a pleasant one 
I ordered then of these heated lotion dispensers. All arrived in perfect condition and in a timely fashion. I received a heated lotion dispenser for a gift and love it so much that I bought them for my daughters, my sisters, and my friends. I even bought one for my granddaughters so they have nice warm lotion to put on after a bath 
I recently purchased this product for the cold winter months in the North. I also had to put lots of lotion on to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy but dreaded putting cold lotion on. This product I would definately recommend to anyone that likes to put lotion on but hates putting it on cold 
I purchased 3 of these. 2 as gifts. I can't say enough about this wonderful product. I love the locking top, on/off button with an indicator light to let you know when the lotion is warm. A gage to set the tempature of the lotion. Easy to use/clean. Pump action is very easy. Friends and family love the gift too! I will be back to purchase more 
Good overall. Needs more sensitive control for temperature setting. Shutoff is nice feature. Should have heavier base. 
At first spray, this can be a pretty potent cologne, but after 1-2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it's green original polo brother. lasts all day long and into the night. Worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto, or lighter scented cologne. 
i'm a smoker and have always had problems maintaining a nice white smile. this is a super powerful electric toothbrush and leaves my teeth sparkling white. you wouldn't even know i was a smoker if i didn't say something. i gave it a 4 out of 5 because it's a little bulky and takes a little while to charge 
I have owned a couple of these toothbrushes for me and my family. It was recommended by my dentist to reduce tarter build-up. I have nothing but good things to say about this brush and I love the integrated toothpaste. It does a fantastic job in keeping down tarter though you still have to floss. It is not the cheapest one on the market and the toothpaste replacements are expensive too but I think it is well worth the cost 
I have used the older model Sonicare toothbrush for several years and was very happy with the results. Your gums feel great and your teeth are really cleaned well. So, I decided to update and purchased the I8300. Once you get used to it (a little bulky) I don't think there is another toothbrush that can compare to it. The concept of having toothpaste guided by you on your teeth and gums with just the push of a button is great. Afer using it for just once, you think your teeth and gums were cleaned by a professional. This is one great toothbrush and I highly recommend it, especially for people who have gum problems. There is one drawback, the toothpaste refills are only made by Crest. But, you don't have to use the refills and can just put your own brand on the toothbrush. Overall, a great product 
I love this toothbrush. It's the best I've ever used. My gum health has improved incredibly since starting to use this. My hygienist told me to go home and gloat to my husband about my gum health because I use this and he does not. I can't believe how well the tartar and plaque stays at bay from using this. I have not had any clumping issues with the toothpaste at all (I would imagine that reviewer had a defective one and should have returned it right away for a new one). I have also not had any issues with it being dirty inside. Nor do I think it's bulky. Great gum massage. Am getting another brush head so that my husband can use it, as well 
This brush performs well. However, use it for 3 weeks and take a look inside--it's filled with bacteria and grime. This stuff is very difficult to remove, especially from inside the part that holds the brush. This is not good because the same bacteria that comes out of your mouth can reinfect your mouth every time you brush. It tends to stay wet inside the brush which makes a great place for this stuff to thrive. The only toothpaste that will work with this is the overpriced Crest toothpaste. I only use Colgate Total (with Triclosan) so I never bothered adding another cartridge after the first few. Don't be fooled--using this brush does NOT replace the need for flossing. Save some money and get the normal Sonicare brush without toothpaste 
I only wished that I had this toothbrush long ago. I love the convenience of the toothpaste already in it. If you have issues with your gums, this is a great tool to use to massage them. I haven't noticed if it really replaces flossing (I still continue to floss), but it does seem to do an excellent cleaning job. Also has a neat timer feature to ensure good brushing. I would recommend this highly 
This item is going into the trash since it performs so poorly it is not worth price of replacement brushes and toothpaste cartridges (which it consumes voraciously). Therefore, I decided to bite the bullet and throw it out - in actuality throwing out over $100.00. However, I wanted to warn other unsuspecting consumers not to be mislead by the claims made by the manufacturer in its ads. This produce DOES NOT get between the teeth - and it is definitely NOT close to flossing in it's effect (nowhere near it in fact). Also, the toothpaste does not flow evenly - it either clumps up and turns into a gooey mess or comes out too fast and gets all over the toothbrush and counter. When I E-mailed Sonicare, (incidentally you have to open an "Account" with them before they will even accept your E-Mail), I was told the time frame for a refund had passed and they were sorry I didn't like their product - Period! When I wrote them back asking them to at least provide the name of a retailer in my area who carries replacement brushes - Wal-Mart stopped handling brushes for that particular model - so I would not have to pay shipping and handling costs on top of everything else, they did not even give me the courtesy of a reply. Bottom line is my Dentist told me my teeth were in much worse shape after using this brush than before. I think that says it all 
With shaving gels and creams, it really is a matter of personal opinion on what one likes. I prefer this product as it does seem to work for me the best on the "tough beards"... I have been cursed with the thick facial hair, so I need to shave using manual razors (can't use electric razors as they just rip and tear when I use them) and this product tends to be the kindest to me of the ones I have tried 
I ordered this thermometer about a week ago, when I returned from my doctor's office with a sinus infection and a fever. I thought it would be accurate, especially based on the reviews. When I received it, I took about 10 readings. The temperature went from 103 degrees to 95 degrees. No two were the same. Last night I tried it on my husband with the same effect. This was a disappointing waste of money, to say the least. If there was a rating less then one star, I'd give it that instead 
This is my first Ear thermometer. I have been using the rectal thermometer on my kid, and now that she has grown I got this better one. I was looking around for different ones - Braun etc and this one is amazing, esp the Swivel tip, it makes it easy to take temperatures even when the kid is asleep. I would definitely suggest this for a first timer ( i paid less than $20 for this ) and i havent experienced any issues with this( I have had it with me for around 3 months now) and use it regularly. 
I have another thermometer which normally takes 15 sec to read the temprature accurately. This one takes 1-2 seconds only. It requires 2 small size battery which are provided. 20 probe covers are also included with the set. Before using the thermometer directly, go through the user manual otherwise you will end up getting wrong temprature. They has given the details as pictures and words which very much explains about the infrared technique utilized in this. I was initially getting incorrect temprature but later on after some practice, was using it properly. A good thermometer for 20 bucks. Only drawback I found, is the battery cover which seems very fragile like other Mark of fitness products battery cover. Why don't they fix this problem :| 
I really like this product alot because I fall asleep easily without feeling groggy or tired the next morning. The ONLY downside is that the ingredients don't exactly smell so great so I drink lots of water when I wash it down, also running to the bathroom from all that water sure gets me outta bed when my alarm goes off 
This product really helps me get to sleep when At time my work schedule changes. Very potent and very good....I recommended it to the other people I work with at the fire station 
I finally found something to help me sleep confortably through the night 
This is the best sleep aid I have ever tried. I sleep soundly and don't feel tired the next day. I have a very odd sleep schedule so this really helps. I'm happy Amazon carries this product. 
Could it be that un-fierce competitors are using this review site because thier products suck? I for one are a valid customer of Somnatrol. The stuff knocks u out without any problem....dude try taking some yourself. 
I hoped that I could go to an un-bias place to get a review on a product, in this case Somnatrol. After reading the reviews I found many to be word for word duplicates but with a different summiteers name. This is obvious even to the most casual observer. As a result I find the entire review process here to be bogus and of no help what so ever. The first "review" was information taken directly from the web site of the product used as sales promotion. That first review was totally worthless, and from reading the rest I can't take any of them seriously. I have not tried the product yet, but I see I will have to and form my own opinion as there are too many duplicated opinions here to make me have any confidence in the integrity of the information. 
Somnatrol is a Proven Natural Remedy for Insomnia, Sleeping Disorders, Sleep Deprivation Symptoms, without the Potential Side Effects of Trazodone and Ambien Pills. It is estimated that over 50 million Americans suffer from some sort of insomnia. While we all have occasional nights when we struggle to fall asleep, nothing can describe the frustration of struggling to go to sleep night after night! Medical science recognizes the strong association between good health and good quality sleep. What is the best way to treat insomnia? Because of limited time and lack of understanding of the natural sleep cycle, many conventional doctors prescribe strong sleeping tablets for insomnia like Diazepam (Valium), Lorazapam, Alprazolam, etc. These can be highly addictive and if used for more than a week or two can result in a lifetime of dependence. Using strong drugs to fall asleep often means that the body's natural sleep cycle is disturbed and the ability to fall asleep naturally is lost. The person often needs to take stronger and stronger medication in order to fall asleep at night. Grogginess in the morning is not uncommon. Somnatrol is unlike any other product of its kind. The unique ingredients in this officially licensed Somnazide product when taken 30-60 minutes before bedtime will start relaxing your body. This feeling of relaxation is the formulas Stage 1 components taking effect. Shortly thereafter you are put into a restful sound sleep as the Stage 2 components take over. Somnatrol is a great way to end your day by both easing stress and supporting a restful night sleep. Mental and physical health depend upon the ability to relax and sleep without interruption 
Please don't squeeze the rater! What can I say about Charmin that hasn't already been said? It's soft. It soaks up liquids well so it's great for TP'ing other people's houses on Halloween! Now I'm gonna describe exactly how it works and what it feels like when it's being used. You see...NOT 
Works wonderfully. With one exception. The finger wrap where the sensor lies is a little too large so it is a bit uncomfortable when wearing it. The system works beautifully when used during heavy exercise 
While this unit may be as accurate as described, I nonetheless had to return it because it was an extremely uncomfortable, annoyingly intrusive fit on my wrist. 
I've tried several monitors over the years....including one that attached to the ear lobe and a chest strap. Neither of these worked at all well. I've had the Mark of Fitness for close to a year and it is great! When I first got it I had probs with it sticking to a constant pulse reading...even changed batteries, but then I read their manual and they indicated that the censor should be on a clear patch of skin. My clearest spot wasn't at the direct bottom of my finger but a bit off to the side. Every since then, it's been great! It's not 100%...you have to have the proper tightness on the velcro strap.....but it's easy to adjust. By the way....I do aerobics walking as well as use an excercise bicyle 
Sooo glad I don't have to wear those sweaty chest straps any more. Works great, plus it looks kinda cool, Robocop style. Lots of comments at the gym.. 
the monitor looks really cool on the hand while cycling or at the gym... however due to its design, it does not provide accurate readings. the finger has to be in a specific position with the sensor and that too without movement if it has to be anywhere close to accurate. I'm going to stick with the chest strap for accurate readings 
THis product was perfect for me. I can now cut and trim my own hair whenever I wish to. It is very easy to use and clean. 
I tried these after a bunch of headaches with a Costco clipper I got a while back. It works great. The cordless feature is a huge plus too. My wife cuts my hair pretty quick with these things and they have stayed sharp for at least 6 months now. For the price these clippers are awesome. I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews though. Maybe it works differently if you trim your hair really short. I think we do 1/2" on the sides and 3/4" on the top 
My boyfriend is really happy with the product allthough the case is really bad I give that no stars. It doesnt close unless you put every piece in perfectly and it does not hold anything in place very bulky plastic, they couldve done better. Otherwise the razor works great 
I am a hairdresser and used to better products.I would not recommend them.They don't cut the hair right,hardly at all actually.I sent mine back 
This item came in a fair space of time and was exactly like the product showed on the Internet. Would not have expected anything less 
First we used it to cut one of my friends and it seemed to work OK because his hair was so thick. After my wife cut my hair, her worries dissapeared because it worked so much better than my old one and it is also cordless so it is really convenient. I hated when the cord of the old machine used to touch me while cutting with its cold cord. I definitely recommend this hair cutter because it does its job really well, it is cordless and very affordable. 
This energy drink is really good. Ignore the reviewer that gave it 3 stars because his body could not get used to Guru's all natural buzz. If you fill your body with unhealthy artificial [...] and then try Guru, your body might freak out. After training your body to Guru's natural ingredients, you won't have to worry about the jump-off-a-cliff effect of unnatural energy drinks. Guru has a soft buzz that definitely picks you up early in the morning, no matter how early you get up. I work a 7AM shift and need to get up around 6. Somedays, my brain is too comatose in the morning and I need Guru to start the day. Somedays, one Guru is not enough and I take half of a second to make it through the day. 98% of the time, one can is enough. Very soft buzz by the end of the day. Don't drink Guru after 4PM or it might keep you awake at night. The drink tastes like soda water, but sweeter and makes your tongue tingle. Definitely does not feel like soda pop. Much healthier too. People should start using Guru in popular bar drinks instead of rolling on E. Much safer and sanitary. Consider your options - natural is better for you in the long run! I'm giving the drink 4 stars because I am field testing the drink for the long run. The jury is still out b/c I've only been using Guru for 3 months now. Good luck on your field tests 
Great deal from Amazon. Was looking for Red Bull but didn't see that. Bought GURU based on the reviews here and it is as good or better then Red Bull. Good price w/ free shipping too! No bad aftertaste and sweetness is just right. You'll like this product! Great for mixing drinks too :) 
Pros: Phoenominal energy drink has a magical energy effect No palpitation effect like RedBull or other energy drinks Completely natural and has interesting ingredients that you find in your green tea Not very sweet at all Cons: One minor aspect was that I had to get used to the taste as it is different. 
I personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks. I rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming. Although energy drinks can be considered a crutch, it's a lifestyle decision that many, many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid... I am one of these people. That said, Guru Energy is fairly cheap ($1.25USD/can) if you buy it here off Amazon, it comes in the Redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans, and is shipped in a suprisingly lightweight and compact case (compare this to Monster, Rockstar, or any other brand with standard 16 fl/oz cans). The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape. I think a particular good feature of Guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup. I appriciate a good quality soda, particularly microbrew colas, and they often exclusively contain cane sugar. So in summary, this energy drink is farily cheap, good buzz, all natural, and great for coding, gaming, or studying 
I'm a professional chef that went corporate. I discovered energy drinks when I was still in the fine dining scene. I used to buy my entire kitchen staff a Redbull from our bar piror to a busy service to get everyone chraged. Since then I've tried perhaps 10-15 different energy drinks from all over the world. And after 8 years, I and have dropped my 1 a day Redbull for Guru. It's honestly 2 steps above the rest in taste, has a smooth yet powerful effect, energizes my mind as well as body and costs less than Rebull and other 8.4oz format drinks. 
this curently is the best energy drink on the market in my opinion. i have tried many of these energy drinks and this one by far is superior for a few simple reasons. 1. no corn syrup 2. no synthetic vitamins 3. no extreme high and then crash and burn 4. it absolutely taste great, not too sweet/ not too carbonated = perfect balance 5. it does the job with perfect harmony the only negative thing i can say, is that it has the notorious natural flavors label, but does not list what all these natural flavors are. we have the food lobbyists to thank for this. GURU! PLEASE LIST EVERYTHING! 
I have had every energy drink out there and this is by far the best. All natural and taste great! Can't ask for anymore. [... 
My old Wahl trimmer was not working right so I purchased this item based on all the positive reviews. What a disappointment! Hair gets caught very quickly in the comb and I have to keep removing the comb to empty the hair. It also periodically catches hair causing my partner to wince. Not good for a trimmer. Even using it corded it was not powerful enough and needed several passes to get a decent cut. We have been cutting each others hair for over 15 years (and saving lots of money in the process). This hair trimmer is one of the worst ones we have bought. I am going to look for another Wahl and will return this product if I can 
I did a lot of research before buying a new beard trimmer, it seems that most of the Panasonic beard trimmer's are the best one's available today instead of the usual names such as Norelco, Wahl or Remington. This particular model seemed to be the best choice based not only for it's features but the price was reasonable too. The best things about this trimmer is that it's cordless, there are MANY settings for the beard length, there's a mini trimmer for detail touch-up work, it's quiet, the charge holds for a long time---I've had this trimmer about a month it's still going on only 1 charge! The drawbacks are that the blades (except the mini trimmer) aren't very sharp, you can only adjust the settings when it's off, there is more maintenance required than some trimmers require, you have to be careful when removing attaching the beard comb. I would say it's worth checking out, but it definitely takes a few good uses to get used to it 
I did not buy this product from Amazon, but through another retailer (cheaper). I did do my research first and came across all the reviews for this product on Amazon. Since it was less than $40, I decided to give it a shot. I own this product for roughly two months now. I am stationed overseas and decided to cough up the $40 vs. $8 haircuts once a week. It more than paid for itself in no time. I give myself a simple haircut once a week (just one length throughout). Some of the user comments on Amazon did not affect me and I felt compelled to tell about it: 1. Binding. Just keep your hair short and trim often and it won't bind. What else can you expect from a cordless trimmer. They do not put out power compared to a corded electric one. Even with the trimmer plugged in, it still will bind. I found this out the very first time I used it. My hair was about 1 1/2 inches long. Yes, it did bind (the first time). After keeping my hair at setting 8 (roughly 1/4 inch), it does not bind anymore. 2. Setting dial gets accidently turned. I never had a problem. Besides, the way I hold the shaver my thumb is permanently planted on the dial anyway so it will prevent it from turning. The other reviewers who had this problem may have been holding it the wrong way. It does require a little finesse, but you'll get the hang of it by the second or third time. 3. Ease of cleaning. The description does not lie when it says submersible. Easy to clean removable blades. Water does not affect this trimmer at all. Very good water-proof design by Panasonic. 4. Comes with a little oil bottle and small brush. I clean the thing every single time I use it so it's ready to go the next time. Just oil the blades after every use (Panasonic recommended oiling before and after). I found too much oil will make it harder to clean because the hair sticks more and water can't simply wash it out. 3. Overall this trimmer is good to go. Will save me a lot of $ during my 1 year deployment. Plus the good thing is I don't have to wait in line anymore to get a 5 minute haircut!!! Hope this helps 
I had a Norelco AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer T765 for a little over a year before I lost the charger. After looking for one both in town (San Diego) and on the Internet, I decided to just buy a new trimmer all together. At this point, I began to do some research. Originally, I looked exclusively at Norelco trimmers though my rational was solely based on name recognition. After reading many reviews and comparing prices, I decided to look at other brands as well. That is when I came across the Panasonic ER224S. The reviews for this product were overall excellent, and the price was appealing as well: only 5 dollars more than my old Norelco when bought at Best Buy. Before we proceed, I should let you know that I am more of a beard growing enthusiast than a beard growing professional. While I have been growing a beard for about a year now, I don't now, nor have I ever had aspirations to have a ZZ Top caliber beard. With that said, for my needs, this beard trimmer does everything I could hope for. This trimmer improves over my old Norelco in so many ways. The adjustment setter has 14 settings for a beard length up to 20 mm over the 9 setting my old Norelco offered, and the setting becomes locked once you power the trimmer on. There is an additional detail trimmer that offers the flexibility that my old Norelco could never offer, and it hides away when you aren't using it. The ER224S also allows you to operate the trimmer while it's charging. This was something that drove me nuts concerning my old Norelco. It's just as quiet as any other trimmer out there and in my opinion, it's the best looking trimmer you can buy. It simply looks classy. It doesn't have a built-in vacuum, but I really don't see that as necessary. From what I have read, they most often break or the performance is sub-standard. In the grand scheme of things, how difficult is it to rinse out the sink after you are done? The trimmer is also rather easy to clean. And the manual was very thorough explaining the ins and outs of the trimmer. In fact, the only con I can think of for this product is the rather large charger. However, I trim my beard 2-3 times a week, and the charge seems to keep for quite some time. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase 
The bulbous design really does make this trimmer easier to hold and use, and I *love* that it is submersible so I can bring it into the shower with me to shave and clean it (instead of getting a 'vacuum' trimmer which many people have complained about). I do need to be careful about making sure that it is on the right setting before turning it on, though 
I'm glad I got it. It's light, looks nice and works well. And the smaller head on the backside really makes a difference when you're trying to trim your mustache, etc 
I love it works great, one flaw.... When you change the numbers for the leneghth you want it to trim, well you have like (1|3|4|6 ...) So one time I left it at 11, but didnt realize i pushed it down (the top).... well it went to 1, and i could see the 1 and the line so I figured it was fine, well guess what, I lost my beard LOL...... They could have made it more user friendly, but once you screw up once you realize never to do it again. otherwise works great! Wish there was a catcher for all the trimmed hair :-) Kosher 
this trimmer is all that was advertised and more. i have very short hair and use the trimmer to keep it that way. so far it is the best trimmer ive had and ive had a few. i would tell my friends to purchase this item. very good deal with competitive price 
I love this product! It is so nice not to have to concern myself with all the different combs that have to be changed with a regular hair cutting instrumen 
This item did exactly what I thought it would. It collected 99% of the hair clipped minimalizing the mess to clean. I would recommend this to anyone 
I bought the product to keep my hair at the shortest lenght possible . Product does what it's designed to do, but pulls when going against the grain. Possibly dull blades or slow speed in cutting 
This product is great, easy in use, quiet and light. I recommend from the bottom of my heart 
My son loves it. He normally will not allow us to cut his hair, and forget the salon. He squirms and runs away. But he actually likes this, since the hair does not end up on his skin, but in the shaver. I plan to do it each week to keep him acclimated 
This product is great. The clean up is nothing compared to when cutting with regular clippers. Almost all the hair is sucked up by the vacuum and cleaning is reduced to wiping down the sink area. The motor could be a bit stronger, but it still cuts the hair without any pulling. 
This is the perfume I wear always when I am going for important appointments. It has light fresh fragrance which is soothing to the senses. It is not obstrusive and does not irritate. This is really a wonderful perfume from the house of Armani 
Good perfume for casual wear. I personally found the prior range of ferrari perfumes better. The perfume seems to give a little too bold fragrance when you just spray it on... however it subsidies pretty soon. Do not buy this perfume if you are looking for something to spray on for a Friday or Saturday night 
smells good...got it for a good price...would recommend if you get it for a reasonable amoun 
This is an eye catching design that is both retro and modern. The pen has a good weight and balance. The only draw back is the chrome is a little slippery to hold, but I am growing used to the pen. A very good value 
This pad was suggested by someone in the massage business.It is really high qualit 
I looked at lots of heating pads and am glad I chose this product it works well as promised. However, had I known there was a smaller version I would have purchased it instead because the 14" x 27" is heavier than I expected. I hope future updates include a control pad that has a lighted background - then this product would rate 5 stars! 
These heating pads are exactly as described in the review and give a particularly soothing, penetrating heat. One of the best features is the automatic cut off. It's the best heatiing pad I've ever had! I hope the company will develop a battery operated variety. 
I had written a poor review previously, based only on the fact that it seemed to take forever for the heating pad to arrive after I ordered it. By the time I got it, I had no use for it and therefore couldn't rate the actual product. Well, the company saw my review and wanted to make it right, so they refunded the expedited shipping I'd paid for, which was considerable. I appreciate customer service like that, especially when I didn't even have to "demand" it. As luck - or whatever - would have it, I HAVE had a need for the heating pad this week. Dr. thinks I pulled a ligament in my back, I don't know. All I know is it killed me, so I pulled out my handy new product and gave it a test ride. I LOVE the size of it, it heated up a lot more satisfactorily than my tiny drugstore one I'd been using, and delivered a nice consistent heat. I also like the weight of it - resting on my other side and laying the pad across the injured part, it felt secure and comfortable. I like it has a digital read on the thermometer, as well as a timer and automatic shutoff. (I'd actually burned my arm on my tiny drugstore model, whose pad inside the flannel covering was plastic - fell asleep with it on me and my arm must've rested on the plastic part accidentally - I think I gave myself a 2nd degree burn!... all better now tho.) So, kudos to the company and the product. Highly recommend. 
My husband and I both have back problems and moist heat seems to ease the pain at times. We've always been told that moist heat is the best. I finally decided to "bite the bullet" and buy a new heating pad (ours was at least 20 years old). You do not have to add any water to this pad - it pulls moisture from the air; it is electric, and will shut off after 30 minutes. You can control the heat. This is worth the investment and we are very happy with it 
It is a great product but only problem is that it gets cold quickly. If you set the temperature on 130 degree and it will heat up quickly but instead of keeping the same heat it gets cold slowly itself which should not have been 
I bought this heating pad for for chronic back pain after trying many other cheaper brands. Out of the box the heating pad feels good. Its heavy and appears well built. It has a digital readout which shows the current temperature and allows you set the desired temperature and treatment time. The default starting temp. is 124. Which in a short period feels too hot. This maybe because once the heating pad reachs 124 it turns off. But the temperature readout shows 132-134. Once the unit shuts off when it reaches its target temperature, it cools off very quickly as far as the sensation of heat on your body. But the temperature readout will stay very high even though the pad feels cool. So you are continually turning the temperature of the pad up, so as to feel warmth. In 15 to 20 minutes you reach the maximum temperature that you can set the heating pad for, then the unit stops heating and your done. I tried laying the unit out flat and walking away. After 15 minutes the temperature still reads 142. And this is the problem with this pad. What ever measures the temperture in this pad is so very very slow to react, that the unit is unable to deliver steady heat. In this regard its the "same old", no better in delivering heat than a $10 heating pad. Also, forget about using the pad in a darkened room unless you take a flashlight. The digital read out has no backlight. The pad does deliver on its promise of moist heat 
A genious came up with the idea to make this shape around the shoulders and neck!! Love it! I also have the regular size TheraTherm and I highly recommend them both. I love the digital display to set your temp and timer to shut-off, cause I sometimes fall asleep and don't have to worry about it being left on. These pads are heavy weight so they slide around and you never add water, it's idiot-proof 
I bought this product for my aunty. I tried it immediately after I received it. When I tried to plug in the battery, the wire connected to the battery cap just came off. I also tried to put on the mask, I didn't feel comfortable with those nail heads pushing against my face. Honestly I don't know whether this product works to make you look younger, but the design looks really unprofessional and like those cheap toys you can get from any pitch for 10 bucks 
In some ways, this is more comfortable than the mouth guard I got from my dentist because it doesn't cover all my lower teeth. In other ways, it's less comfortable because it's very flexible and can move out of place. I do like the adjustable sides, though. Overall, I'm happy with it because it's a lot less expensive than a custom-fitted dental device. And it does keep me from biting down on my teeth at night, which means I no longer am waking with a sore jaw. The minty flavor was pretty apparent at first, but now I hardly know it's there. So it really doesn't matter what flavor you buy 
Clearly this night guard works for some people, but after wearing it for a week, my jaw/bite seems totally thrown off. Yesterday I couldn't open my mouth more than an inch without experiencing severe pain and today my jaw still feels out of wack and is clicking and locking. I returned it to the drug store where I bought it and they gave me back my money, but this jaw thing is so incredibly annoying and depressing, if it doesn't clear up, I'm going to go nuts. My advice: pay the money and get a custom guard made by your dentist, don't risk developing a chronic condition 
Ever since my mom passed away, it seemed like I was grinding my teeth in bed without me even noticing. I would wake up with deep headaches and bad toothaches. It got to the point where instead of grinding away at the ends of my teeth, I was actually grinding them so hard that I would explode them at the gumline, causing immense pain from exposed roots and nerves. UGH. I had about five back teeth pulled, thinking that it would be the end all, but then I just started grinding the rest of them. I finally bought this Night Guard, and now that I have it set comfortably, I no longer wake up in the middle of the night clutching my mouth and my head in excruciating pain. Honestly, unless you're a really mild grinder, you probably have to get a new one of these every six months to a year, but that's a small price to pay for such a wonderful device 
I started grinding my teeth at night while studying for the Bar Exam (yeah, guess you could say I was stressed ... ). I went through 2 different models of the boiler mouth guards (you boil the mold, bite it, and then immerse in water to set it) but really didn't like them, and they seemed flimsy. Ultimately, I found this sleepguard model online and tried it out. It was soooo much better! Instead of fitting over all you teeth, it just creates an overall gap by keeping your back molars apart. This model was a keeper. I don't use it anymore because I stopped grinding after the exam - either because the stress was gone or because this trained me not to ... but whatever the case, if I had to buy one again, it would definitely be this model. I was very very pleased with it. 
All thanks to this sleep guard, I don't wake up in the morning with splitting headaches and jaw pain anymore. This sleep guard is adjustable and fits on my molars perfectly. Many times I was unconscious about grinding my teeth (aka: bruxism). Even when I yawned, I grinded my teeth (weird but it happened). I sleep with this in my mouth for 3 nights and my mouth muscles are properly trained to keep the teeth apart while sleeping. This is my second one that I purchased ( I somehow lost the first one). Overall, definetly worth the money 
My dentist recommended this device as an alternative to the more costly night mouth guards that she fabricates. She is right, It is very effective 
I bought this product for myself 6 weeks ago. I waited this long before writing so I could honestly say if it worked or not. I've used other bite guards and was leary of purchasing one that said it would "fit right out of the box", but I was pleasantly surprised. It actually does fit, with no boiling or adjusting. It is flexible yet firm enough so I don't grind. I will never buy any other kind after having this one. I highly recommend this product 
I've had it for one day and it seems to be accurate. I calibrated the UA-787EJ against the manual setup (stethiscope, gauge and cuff) that I purchased last week and the readings are consistant. I read the first review that stated their disatisfaction b/c the readings were "high". I would recommend calibrating the unit yourself and if it is off, return it for another or a refund. For the last week I've tested several monitors in the local stores (Omron, ReliOn, LifeSource) and I felt that all of them reported low BP readings. I even ordered one that was very eratic in its readings but was always 10 to 12 points lower than the readings taken w/a stethiscope (sometimes I used the BP machine at Wal-Mart, which seemed to be consistent). I returned it for a refund. I work at a hospital, and a co-worker used the new UA-787EJ this morning, found that his blood pressure was very high, went down to ER and indeed it was extremely high. If you have doubts about the accuracy, I suggest purchasing the manual steth., gauge and cuff to do your own calibartion. It was the only way I could be confident the automatic unit was accurate and reliable. The manual setup only costs about $16.00 from Wal-Mart (maybe less from Amazon) and taking your BP is easy. 
This hair dryer has completely changed my ability to manage my mornings! I have 2 young children and a 45 minute commute so, as you can imagine, I don't get much time for myself in the morning. Well, now I don't NEED time for me. I used to spend at least 3-5 minutes drying my layered, shoulder-length hair and then from 5 and 10 minutes getting it styled properly. The CHI 1300 hair dryer dries my hair in about 45 seconds, and it no longer requires separate styling - the dryer works with my hair's natural texture and leaves it shiny, soft and needing only some pomade to look finished and gorgeous. The volume and body last all day - no more bad hair days. It sounds silly to say an appliance can really improve your life, but this one has. Well worth the expense 
Excellent personal facial groomer and easy to use. Nice clean shave and no, your facial hair does not grow back thicker after you have shaved. Make-up foundations and moisterziers go on so much better and look flawless on. I will never wax or use cream hair remover again. 
it is quite handy and efficient, really easy to use. however, it is written in the manual coming with a soft carrying case but NOT THERE!!! 
This little trimmer is ideal for women who want to cut down on that fuzzy face look. It is quiet and works well. Now I don't have to sneak my husband's electric razor to keep from looking like a nanny goat 
After reading a lot of reviews here, I decided to try this dryer. I have a dryer that I love, but I thought I should try to find a back-up for the inevitable time when mine dies. The one I have is a vortex dryer(with a bell shaped end) that lifts the hair as it dries and is wonderful! Anyway, I can't find the same model, so I tried this Revlon model. Oh my...I have shoulder length color treated hair, kind of medium thickness and I ended up with a fuzzy mess! I gave up before it was quite dry and went back to my other dryer. I wish I would have had time to start over, but I would have been late for work. Ugh....hate a bad hair day. Another thing....the on/off switch is at a bad place. I kept turning it off as I was using it! My thumb kept hitting the switch. So....its not for me, but YMMV(your mileage may vary) 
I must admit, I wasn't expecting the response that I received from my wife. After seeing that she was constantly complaining that she need a better hairdryer, I set out to research and try to find her the best one. After careful research, I settled on this one. I will never forget her reaction after her first time using it. The most notable claim obviously was how fast it dried her hair. Easily a quarter of the time it usually takes her and also how lightweight it was. She herself proclaimed that next to diamonds, this was probably the best gift she had ever received. I highly recommend this hairdryer for anyone who is looking to drastically cut their hairdrying time. 
I purchased one of those super expensive ionic hair dryers then did a little more research and good housekkeepping recomended this dryer for a better price. How about $110. dollars less and it does a great job. I have very thick wavey hair and this dryer cut my dry time in aprox. half plus it makes it super shiney. for the price it's a great dryer. So I sent back the T3 I had ordered and got my money back 
I bought this hairdryer because the product info said it was very light. Well it really is light and it works great. It is a great hairdryer for the price. 
I was torn between purchasing this and the ConAir version of the same thing. I was turned off by the Conair reviews about the weight of the hairdry. I don't regret my decision at all! I have curly hair and I wear it both straight and curly. The high setting is perfect for when I straighten my hair and the light setting makes perfect curls. I couldn't be happier 
Bought the hairdryer for my wife as a gift. She loved it. It is light weight and has all the necessary functions/setting etc. Good value for money overl 
This is a great dryer. It has reduced my dry time and has made my hair noticeably smoother. Great price too. 
This is the best brush I have used. It does not tangle in my hair or rip out my hair when brusing it when wet. It is great to blow dry with and is also great on dry hair, less static. It has not let me down and I have tough frizzy hair 
I just got my brush in the mail today and used it. I love it! It doesn't snag my hair or tangle it like other brushes. I love the design and the color. Overall, a very good product 
Why I like this brush: * Bristles do not snag on my hair * Excellent for use with hair dryers * Great brush for wet or dry hair. * Does not cause static when brushing dry hair. * Has nice weight in the handle I have had this brush for over a year and just ordered 2 more(one for my purse and another for the office). 
This is a fantastic product. Makes curling with a blowdrier easy. I love it 
I used clipper for the first time and was amazed at how well it worked. My dog has coarse hair and it took me a while to get the job done, but the dog tolerated the buzzing sound and clipper did not overheat as other brands do. I do recommend this clipper for anyone who wants to pay a reasonable price for a good working clipper. 
Great clipper. Does not stop working after a few uses as most of the other clippers do 
These worked great. Didn't heat up even after a few hours of shaving. Only thing that bothered me was that the lengthening attachments kept popping off 
I just bought this item today after going through multiple alarm clock/music combo models. This one had most of the features I was looking for. The pros: Works with any iPod, digital am/fm tuner, neat projection, calming sounds feature, nice design, good sound quality, dual alarms, sets itself, lithium ion battery in case of power outage. and while this one is kind of nitt picky it was important to me, it has the back and forth dial for setting the alarm. That way while setting it if you accidentally go past the time when you want to wake up you can just push backward instead of going all the way back through. It is VERY easy to set. The cons: Kinda pricey, kinda big, the "beep" is really irritating (but you can wake up to ipod, radio, or soothing sounds), no remote, and you need to scan through music on ipod via click wheel (no scan buttons on actual machine). Despite the few cons, i would say that this is worth the 80 bucks. I am enjoying mine 
I got this item with the idea of using each piece as a stocking stuffer for little girls - I put a pretty pink bow on each. It comes in a white cardboard box and if given to one child as a gift, it looks like you went and got a wholesale gift with similar items especially since there is a big label with bold capital letters that reads "BOX SOLD AS 1 ITEM DO NOT OPEN". Best if distributed seperately. Each piece is cute within itself but too small to hand out alone - best when combined with a primary gift. 
I have several of these glasses now. Love them. They are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck. I wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one. Good price and good product. 
I saw these reading glasses on CSI:NY and just had to have them! It's really nice to have a quality pair of reading glasses...and the WOW factor doesn't hurt either! I've read some of the reviews and can see where women with hair past their shoulders might have a problem with this type of glasses. My hair is shortish (layered to the bottom of my neck) and I wouldn't want it any longer if I was going to wear these glasses a lot...which I do! They aren't portable...but they aren't supposed to be. I keep mine in my office where I need to take them on and off the most frequently. I'll probably get another pair for home but I'll used my old ones I can put in my case for carrying in my purse. All in all...I'm very glad I got them 
I enjoy how these glasses function. I don't lose them and there are no strings to get tangled. People remark about them. They are a little goofy, but fun goofy. enjoy 
I'm just crazy about these glasses. They are comfortable, fashionable and the talk of the town. What I like best is the plastic "holder" stays in place when not in use, even when I'm riding my scooter around town. Kudos to the inventor of this little gem 
This is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses. The Click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them. He gets lots of comments about how neat they are 
I was really excited when I saw these reading glasses that split at the nose bar, how nifty, just wear them looped over the back of your neck and click the lens part together whenever you have to read the fine print. Great idea, but the execution of the idea is not for everyone. The back piece is also hard plastic, rigid, and if you have long hair, you have to lift them out from under your hair and place the plastic back strip at your mid-skull level, fit them on your ears and then fit the front parts together and snap. From the back you end up looking like you are wearing an external orthodontic apparatus. I'd like to see the company put a string in place of the hard plastic that loops around your neck. The magnetic clip that brings the two lenses together in the front is a fabulous idea, and having the two lenses hanging off to the sides instead of a whole pair of glasses swaying across your front is so much more comfortable and out of the way - it's just the rigid frame at the back that makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they were mass manufactured 
I have found this to be a great comfort and therapy for me. I have fibromyalgia and have had back surgery in the past and it is wonderful to sit back in here with the heat and/or massage (with the ability to adjust the amount of massage according to comfort level and areas needing it) and relax. It has been a tremendous help to my daily living, a wonderful product!!! My husband drives for a living and finds it quite relaxing as well to sit in it and relax his backa nd shoulders. I highly recommend this 
Hi everybody, this chair is awesome, my motors did not go out like the other persons yet but I`ve just put mine together, and all I can say is it is fab-u-lous. I have permanent nerve damage in my back and run my own web site. The chair I had before was made wrong and had a bolt sticking out of it causing me severe pain making it so difficult for me to get any work done. I was a little skeptical buying this for use at my computer in fear it would not be suitable for a desk but it is actually perfect for mine, it`s the perfect height and I don`t have to sit up much to use the mouse like I did with my other chair that was made for a computer which killed my back even without the bolt. This chair is "A" number one for quality and pricing, it does smell like vinyl, but you can easily get over this when you see how much it feels just as comfy as any of those overpriced leather chairs, if not more so. My back thanks amazon.com, comfort products, my $149.99 that I used to buy it with, and God for bringing this wonderful chair into my life making it possible for me to get more work done with less pain, even if the chair only worked for a month, it would be worth what you pay considering the cost people pay for massage therapy and chiropractors. Sincerely Rock On, Pipe 
Got a good deal on this for a Friday sale. Ottoman motors went out first then the thigh motors. The replacement parts that they sent have been working trouble free for a couple of months. I think that I initially just got a bad batch. The company has been great to work with and have sent out the replacement parts quickly. My only suggestion is to heavily use this product for the first month to insure that you did not receive a defective one like I received 
The product was good product. It is a powerful Mustache and beard trimmer. Vacuum is not perfect but its catches about 80% of the hair. The major complaint is that the adapter stop working after one charge. Without this problem product would have gotten 4 stars 
I purchased this for a friend for Christmas and he absolutly loves it. This trimmer is Great he said; vacuum workes great, doesn't clog, doesn't pull the hair. He/I would recommend to anyone. 
Quick and easy to use. Good blade guard for determining length of beard. Somewhat awkward to hold at different angles. On/off switch is in a "counter-intuitive" position - I sometimes have to search for it unless I'm looking straight at it 
These are the best nursing pads. Don't waste your money on anything else. 
I've tried several nursing pads, and I have to say these are the BEST. They are like diapers, which wick away the moisture from your skin and the absorbent center turns into gelly, and keeps you dry. I've tried several other brands, and these are the best. They larger then some other pads and are thin so they are not seen through your clothes. These pads are more expensive then most, but its worth it since you don't have to change the pad as often as others 
I would recommend this product to every mom. It does not leak, it's not noticable under your bra,it's very comfortable and it stays in place. Also it does not stick to your nippes like Johnson and Johnson brand. 
I have tried other pads and this one is the best...plus the 3 pack comes with a couple of free milk storage bags. Thin, individually packed and perfect for the pumping and/or breastfeeding mom...use them to catch let-down on the breast your baby is not latched on to 
Gives hair shine without being greasy or slimey. Also can be mixed with all other bumble and bumble products. But be careful, use too much, and you will weigh your hair down 
Its really small and handy..Its just the size to carry anywhere but the wire is too long thats the only drawback. Still you can go for this and the price suits. The colour is cute 
Got this for my mom. She'd been looking for one of these for a while and was very happy with the product 
Thanks for the very fast transaction and shipping! Got it just intime for christmas as planned. Item was very nice. Thanks Agai 
This does the business with minimum demand for luggage space and perfectly adequate for maintaining an adult and professional appearance. Why spend more 
When I was a kid I owned a number of different hairdryers that were all bigger, stronger and more expensive (comparatively) than this one. But as a (grown-up)man this one suits my needs. I admit it is the first hairdryer I have owned in about 15 years, but serves to save me from the old wet hair in winter - get a cold with ease connection. If you have hair you can put in a ponytail, look for another hairdryer 
This is a small but powerful hair dryer. Mine arrived slightly cracked so I was not sure if it would work. After trying it out I found it does work rather unexpectedly well. It is light weight that would be handy for travelling. The material does look cheap and filmsy. But as long as it works that's good enough. 
This one if functional (has been using since a month), but looks very flimsy. Probably becauses of low weight, which is a plus 
Items were received in a timely basis and were in excellent condition 
Having a scale that only goes in pounds has been difficult when looking for small pieces of encouragement. This scale is not only good looking, but offers encouragement in steps of .2 pounds and does so reliably. I recommend it highly 
The weight is accurate and the numbers are easy to read. If it would kick out a fortune, this would be the perfect scale.. 
An easy transaction with Amazon and fast service. The batteries are excellent and I bought them at a very fair price 
Set it up the way you like it. Sounds great and adds beauty on those intimate nights with the one you lov 
I just got my fountain today and the setup was simple and easy.the fountain is a good size and the (black)slate plates are nice.The rocks are ok but "I" would like more for the bottom to lower minor water sprinkle.Very low noise of the pump even with the high flow. I had some extra stick-on rubber bumpers and put them on the bottom of the base which is made of plastic and now no vibrations at all, you can also use those stick-on felt pads.The light is good if your in a very dark,dark room but works more like a night light.Oh almost forgot I LOVE IT! hey I think Ill get one more since Im here 
I read the other reviews, which were mostly positive. Based on the negative reviews, I had some concern about the appearance of the fountain and the amount of noise it might make. After actually buying and setting it up, I am quite satisfied with the fountain. It is more solid-feeling than I expected, was easy to set up, runs quietly, and actually looks nice. The box included plenty of smooth rocks, which I have supplemented with some rocks and shells from the beach. As noted in other reviews, it is a one-sided fountain, i.e. it is intended to be viewed from one side-- this works quite well on a shelf or against a wall, but might not work so well on a table where it could be viewed from all sides. A couple of minor issues: to adjust the pump speed, you have to take out all the rocks and slates to reach the pump. And, I have not (yet) had to clean it, but again, will have to take everything out to do so. Overall, this purchase exceeded my expectations for the price 
I am a 24 year old male in great shape(just so you all know im no wimp). When I used the trimmer on my Arms the pain was so bad I about passed out(not joking). This may work out better for womens legs because their legs are used to being shaved so the skin is much tougher. It will irritate your skin(similar to when you get waxed: red bumps). It for the most part removes the hair at the root. I myself am going to stick to waxing/Nair. It is much less painful and MUCH Much faster. I would recommend taking some pain pills prior to trying this it will make it much more pleasant. If you do decide to buy one then make sure that you are able to return it for a refund in case it hurts you as badly as it did me. Hope this helps you all out 
I bought this epilator about 3 months ago and here are my thoughts on it. Pros - saves money on razors - good on large areas - entertaining if you're bored Cons - no matter how many times you use it, the pain does not go away (you have to be drunk to use it on your bilini and use tranquilizers to use on your armpits) - ingrown hair can be a problem (especially in the bikini area) - hair doesn't grow back that much slower than shaving (after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth) - the epilator doesn't pick up fine hair - if it does, it just rips it. 
I use this product every week and love it, my husband loves it too! No more nubs! I have owned a variety of these products over the past 20 years and this is the best. I feel no pain, only smooth legs 
I had this item previously, and was searching for a replacement. I purchased other epilators but they didn't come close to doing the job emjoi did 
if you have hair and you want it gone for a longer period than shaving, this is the item!! i like it . others might not, because it hurts the first couple of times. once you are use to the feeling, its fine. its easy, and FAST. i love i 
Not as painful as I thought it would be on the legs, just some slight prickling, like little pins, you can definitely tell it's working. I thought with this having two heads I wouldn't have to go over the same area again and again, but I do, this is a major drawback. Horrible for the bikini line, don't even think about it, the pain goes from feeling like little prickles to feeling like great tufts of hair are being pulled out at once, when it's really only getting a few; it also seemed to skip over my skin and pinch me as well, and we all know you don't want to be pinched there. Overall: Recommended for legs and large areas where skin is taut and easily accessible, do NOT buy this product in hopes of using it on your bikini line- Buy the Braun Silk Epil Xelle for that instead. 
This item arrived DOA -- didn't even get to the 6-month death that other reviewers speak of. What a waste of time. Emjoi products truly are cheap. AVOID 
If you have back pain, the first thing you should try is this. It's amazing! I almost have lost my pain 
I purchased this lumbar cushion to complement a coccyx cushion I had purchased. When this cushion is placed properly, it provides excellent lumbar support, and is quite comfortable. However, the cushion is oddly shaped, in that it won't easily attach to any of my chairs. The silly little black strap on the back of the cushion does not add any sort of stability to the cushion, so it slides as I sit. It also falls off of my chair whenever I stand up. Aside from the hassle of constantly repositioning the cushion, or picking it off the floor (which may be difficult for someone with back pain), this lumbar support is excellent. Accompanied by a coccyx cushion, this cushion is wonderful for my back. I do recommend it to anyone in need of lumbar support, regardless of the cushion's inability to remain in one place. This is a great product, but it is poorly designed. I plan on keeping it for a very long time, and find it to be quite helpful. If you do not mind picking it up off the floor and repositioning it every time you sit, then you should buy it. It is definitely worth the money, and will prove to be invaluable to your back 
I purchased this back support a few weeks ago. It easily installed on my bucket car seat and feels great. I am sorry I did not get something like this years ago. 
I have two herniated discs (L4, L5) in my lower back and went through PT during the month of December. The physical therapist stated that I needed to constantly strive to keep the curve in my lumbar supported along with exercise. I showed him this cushion and he gave his 100% approval. I used it for a month and liked it so much I got two more. One for the car, the LaZboy, and the computer chair. Why not! Look at that price! The best part is it is now the end of January and I know that I will recover thanks to exercise and the support I've been receiving when sitting and using this wonderful product 
Love this item to death. I purchased it as a gift for my mother that has a bad back and hips, so sitting is most often then not painful. She loves and feels completley relaxed. Its beter then those memory foam ones that just crush under weight, this lumbar pillow actually supports you in comfort. I highly recomened this product 
I teach indoor cycling classes and work a regular office job, so between my horrible posture at my desk and all the hunching over I do on the bike, my back HURTS. After a lot of research and debating over spending extra $$$ on certain supports, I decided on this one. It is GREAT. My back aches are gone and sitting in my desk chair at work is now actually a comfort. I love it so much I bought one for my husband! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Like many people beyond the age of 50, I frequently experience some degree of lower back pain. I purchased this cushion for my chair in my office. The benefit is twofold: my back feels much better throughout the workday and I feel the amount of discomfort I experience away from work is decreased 
Once we finally got this table put together, we loved it. Not much to say other than it's pretty sturdy and of good quality. But... I think we would have had a much easier time assembling it if we had simply thrown the instructions away and solved it like a puzzle. The instructions were vague, error ridden, and omitted important parts and steps. This manufacturer really needs to thoroughly test, update, and edit their assembly instructions. I believe the tables are made in the states, so it's not a translation issue 
I like the table but there were no casters or instructions with it. I had to buy some casters and figure out how to put it together 
15 years ago I had paid around $45 for a "well-used" hospital-grade table for a sick room. It was almost identical to this model, except with an older-style crank handle. I have "loaned it out" and it is still in daily use--even with young ones sometimes "swinging" on it. I love this over-bed table, and WHAT A TERRIFIC VALUE ON SALE! I just bought a second one on a recent Amazon sale, plus $20 Coupon for future purchases. (First one purchased 3/05) The up and down motion is easy, yet secure. I have used it in a sick room, but it also can be pressed into service as an extra "pull-up table" for various projects. Being able to change the height (even standing height!) and roll it around (it has secure brakes) makes it useful for many situations around the house. Believe me, it is easy to assemble, AFTER correctly identifying the screws and bolts.

THANK YOU, AMAZON. ---------------------- (Update to my review from May 2005: QUALITY, STRONG, FUNCTIONAL I received my DuroMed Over-The-Bed Table this week from a recent Friday Sale, and I am very pleased. It took me about 15 min. to assemble with a screwdriver and pliers. The numbers on the Parts List was somewhat confusing. Also, the last instruction has an omission...."Install casters (8,9) as shown and replace BLACK SHIPPING SCREW with chrome screw (14) 
I was pleased to find Safari, because it is discontinued in lots of stores. It is at an exceptional price as well. We are pleased with the fast service 
Whoa...this parfum was way too strong for my taste. I'm wondering if I was even sent the wrong product. I read the rave Amazon reviews and I thought the price was reasonable, so I thought I would give it a try. This parfum smelled so strong and loud, I gave it to my boyfriend! I hated it...I prefer light fresh or sweet floral smells, and this parfum smelled heavy and musky, even masculine. One spritz is enough. Two is overkill. I personally wouldn't recommend it, to a woman or man 
I've always loved this fragrance. This is a fantastic buy on this size bottle. I heard recently that they're discontinuing Safari, so those who use it will want to stock up on it before it's removed from the shelves 
I agree with the previous reviewer. I have worn Safari since it was introduced and I love it. It's true, people ask me all the time what perfume I'm wearing. I can't believe the price! Whenever I only have one bottle left in my linen closet stash, I get a little panicky ...so I stocked up 
This is the only scent I have used for over 15 years. I constantly get compliments on "how good you smell!!". I have had men follow me to ask me what I am wearing so they can buy it for their wives. I love this scent! 
ok i highly suggest NOT getting this, all my friend says about it is horrible, it like makes her hair snarly, and stuff, and the colors suck, i mean, come on, get better colors, like the other person said, purple would be COO 
The colors go on easily.. washes out in 2 to 3 washings. Only wish they had more colors.. Like purple. Great item 
We bought this for my 10 year old. She loves it. It goes on easy (she can do it herself), clean up is easy and it washes out of her hair after one use. Lets her express herself without being permanent 
My 10 year old daughter received this for her birthday and always wants to use it. It's great for sleepovers! It was the hit of the party 
my daughters got this for christmas and it works great. They colored everyones hair. They are having a blast with it 
I ordered these with the Pro Color Accent Hair Color Kit and they work great. These really do just as they advertise 
I bought this trimmer to be able to trim my beard but I think this is really designed to cut hair etc. The battery life if mediocre and the chamber gets full really easily. The trimmer is not very good to trim your beard. If anything, its good to shorten the length of your beard but is still patchy, and you need a manual razor to clean up your shave 
I had an old norelco trimmer. Lost it. Just bought this one. So far its good. Really like the vacuum feature. Even though the vacuum power is not that strong, still it works. Better than not having it. 
This is the second Norelco I have had and it works great for the money. Vacuum lacks some but I didn't buy it because of that - that was a perk 
I love the power and design but sometimes the comb level changer gets stuck and it is annoying to fix it. Overall - Recommended 
Works great and keeps a good charge. Much better than corded versions and the vacuum function really works 
Excellent product, the battery lasts forever, the vacuum works perfectly, easy to clean. I've had older models and different brands, Norelco is still the best for me in trimmers. 
Two things about this trimmer. I leave it plugged in most of the time unlike my last trimmer (older model Norelco) that had a holder/battery charger that teetered and fell over alot. The best feature is the nifty holder for the cut hair. It collects neatly in a little compartment-hey, my wife is happy no more hair to clean off the sink 
My wife always hated when I trimmed my beard because of all them little bitty hairs all over the sink. The T780 is not perfect but it does catch about 90% of those pesky little hairs. The trimmer is powerful and has no trouble with my dense beard. The batteries last a good long while between recharges. On the down side if you are a little aggressive with pressure as you trim it can slip to a shorter setting and it is a little heavier then some trimmers I have used in the past. All in all though it is a well designed trimmer that I enjoy using 
great chair this is 3rd one bought. one for every shower in my house. best price I've found. kazmata 
PRODUCT IN GENERAL WORKS AS DESCRIBED AND BENEFITS ARE VISIBLE WHEN USED AS DIRECTED. Unfortunately, product failed after 8 months of daily use. The email address and toll free number for customer service for CLARISONIC is completely useless and dead. After my brush became defective, I contacted Clarisonic Customer Service for repair/exchange. Sent five emails over a a two month period, left message on answer machine at Clarisonic customer service and absolutely no answer. The warranty of one year is completely useless at this point. A wise consumer and purchaser should be given a reliable customer service when purchasing this product at this price. USE THE PRODUCT WHILE IT WORKS. When it stops, THROW IT AWAY because you WILL NOT get a response from Clarisonic directly 
I am very happy with my clarisonic. It has helped my skin stay clear without irritating it. It also makes any product I put on after using it, such as moisturiser or retin-A absorb better 
I have had this item for three months now. I noticed a difference immediately after using it. It thoroughly cleans the skin; leaving it "squeaky" clean. My skin feels smooth after each use. I use it on my neck also and experienced the same results. I am very satisfied with this product 
I've had my brush for many months and it's never had a single problem which, of course, doesn't mean they are all perfect. I've had yucky skin for decades and have purchased every automatic skin product I've come across -- the one where you stick your head in a bowl of bubbling water (I nearly drowned), the little face steamer that didn't have a temperature control and produced live steam to the scalding point and then eventually started sparking and self-destructed, the battery-operated brushes with different "heads" that did nothing, etc. Once I discovered the Murad product line, I enjoyed a vast improvement but it was THE BRUSH in conjunction with the Murad products and the dozens of skin scrubs, toners, cleansers that cleared my complexion practically overnight. I could actually see a difference after using it only once! Plus it's fun to use. I swear by this product and have just purchased 3 more as Christmas gifts. Even if you have a good complexion, this is the tool for you! 
Not real strong smelling scent but this bag is great! Worth the extra money 
No reviews yet, so might as well add one. I am sure most people would tell you kitchen garbage bags are a personal preference kind of thing. Well, I guess they would be right. I like these because they smell good also. As an added bonus, you get a whole case of them: 240 bags!! For most people that would be at least a years worth of good smelling garbage bags. Only issue I had was finding the shelf space to give up for a whole year to store them. They are the durable Hefty bags that we have all come to love and adore. Caution: Keep out of reach of small children and be careful to not inhale the bag as you are checking out the Kitchen Fresh smell 
This thermometer takes very quick temperatures. It seems to be pretty accurate. It has a nice soft tip and is made of a soft rubber (comes in a baby blue color). Only complaint about it is that the rubber does have a funny taste that I would think would eventually go away after use (I did wash it before using and will recommend the same). The plastic case is exposed on the outside of the box it comes in so it was a bit scratched up on the outside of the case (purchased from amazon). Nonetheless it's very quick (very close to 10 seconds in the mouth if used properly). This is a great little purchase though, especially for the price 
Nice tip and easy to read. Great price 
the measurement is not accurate. The reading is lower than the real temperature (compared with my other theromometers including the traditional one) if you take 2-3 times consequently, the reading will vary a lot(around 1-2F). I have to believe the highest one. It is very confuse. I think the problem is not from incorrect using. Since these problems happened in adult as well as children 
Used this item as a filler to get a $20 promo discount along with a MF77 BP monitor. This item works just fine and is easy to use 
USELESS ITEM. DO NOT PURCHASE. ITEM IS A WASTE OF MONEY. COMPANY WILL NOT ACCEPT A RETURN YOU CANNOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK IF YOU ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. THE MOTORIZED VERSION PERFORMS AS ADVERTISED 
I heard about The Tingler for years, and found the listing on amazon quite randomly. This was the least expensive one, so I decided to see what all the hub-bub was about. It's a really indescrible sensation, but the name Tingler pretty much sums it up. The most common reaction I get to it is a lot of squealing, even from the guys. I have one friend, though, that absolutely hates it; I think it may just be too intense for her. Even my cat and dog like it! It's a truely unique sensation, and even a little addicting. Certainly not one of life's necessities, but definitely one of it's little pleasures 
The shaver works great and keeps its charge for quite a while. Delivery was a little slow 
Best, closest shave I have ever had with an electric shaver. Nice charger also...does not take up room like others 
I used to Buy Mens Shavers- But this one is by FAR the Best Shaver I've owned!! It gets SO Close! very Happy 
It is a great product my husband loves shaving with it and I love touching his skin. 
This is the best bet for the Norelco 7000 series. Its much better smooth than the Norelco Gel 
I like the lotion much more than the gel for this shaver. I have very sensitive skin so this helps a lot. My main complaint is that I have to use a lot of it 
I like this better then the shaving gel because it leaves your skin a lot smoother, making shaving enjoyable. Great product. Wish more packs came in a box 
THIS SHAVER WILL NOT GIVE A COMFORTABLE SHAVE WITHOUT THE LOTION DISPENSER. FEEL ROUGH AND NOT SMOOOTH. LOTION IS 1.00 A TUBE AND LAST ABOUT 15 SHAVE WHICH IS A GOOD VALUE.. 
For years I've had shaver "burn" on my neck, whether I used a traditional razor or an electric one. I tried any number of electric shavers over the years. The Norelco shaver that uses the Nivea lotion is the only one that has resulted in skin that doesn't feel or looked like I used sandpaper on my skin. Highly recommended for those with this problem. 
this product works well for me. Too bad it didn't also come in a bottle like other pre shave lotions. I use it most of the time as I've been in a hurry at times and use my Norelco shaver dry, but I like it with the lotion better. Shower shaving is nice too. The steam in the shower helps set up my beard. All in all it's very convenient for travel too. I recomend it highly. 
I bought this product because I had one from years ago that I use when I go to the gym but lost. It's great at drying me off while i'm working out and yet the towel isn't wet. I am conflicted though. I bought this one when I lost the one I already had. It's a bit thinner and not the same deminsion as the original, but I still like it for what it does. I also like the little bag that it comes in, which I didn't have with the original one 
My hair is fine, thin, and straight, and it tends to air-dry quickly while I'm getting ready in the morning. I spray it with Tonic before drying it, and I get a much better blow-dry than if I had used water. Tonic is great as a leave-in conditioner, especially when your hair is too fine to condition daily (as mine is). Use it with Thickening Spray or Styling Creme before drying to volumize your hair 
They are small, easy to use and do a fantastic job cleaning glasses. The package can be open in such a way as to act as a protective holder for the cloth to keep it clean yet the entire thing fits in a shirt pocket without being lumpy. These are extremely hard to find outside of Amazon.com. Try them out. 
An excellent product for cleaning your glasses or other lenses. They are small enough to carry around in your pocket. They lift off dirt, fingerprints, etc. I recommend washing your cloths weekly in hot water to keep them completely clean. The cloths will not scratch, but debris left in the cloth can scratch 
I had never heard of these things before nor had I heard anybody talk about them...I just randomly bought them from amazon and I have to tell you...if you wear glasses...these are ABSOLUTELY INDISPENSIBLE. It's honestly, besides maybe my mp3 player, my toothbrush, and my wallet, the only item I use daily and it is a very effective product for its size and price. I use them almost exclusively on my glasses but they say you can use them on all kinds of stuff like computer monitors and so on...I have yet to try it on them, but when you wipe these things over your lenses, there is a definite feeling of them getting clean...If you're looking for a pocket sized solution to keep things clean, this is it. 
I carry one of these in my pants pocket every day. It works great for cleaning my glasses. I am buying more of them as gifts for friends who have glasses. The first one I got, was at a trade show, from the 3M booth. I liked it so much I went back and asked them if I could take it. Thankfully they said yes 
I love this product. I already have this but needed more and wanted to give them to some of my friends. I also use the larger ones for cleaning the house 
I probably never would have considered purchasing this cleaning cloth without having it recommended to me in an article about Treo 650 (smartphone) accessories. Using anything other than a cleaning cloth designed for these sensitive surfaces can lead to scratches and permanent damage. I carry it in my laptop case and use it almost daily, both to remove the oily residue left by my fingers that quickly builds up on my Treo's touchscreen, but also to keep my laptop computer screen sparkling. It's fast, it's easy and it's a safe and inexpensive way to protect your investments 
I bought this for my husband as a gift, he really likes how close it shaves, but says it definately takes a couple of weeks for your skin to get used to it as it is REALLY sharp 
This shaveer was given to me as a christmas gift. I liked the loook and the titanum blades of the remington line so I gave it a try. I am overall very satisfied with the razor. The company advises that you replace the screen and blades every 6 months but at a retail store those cost over $25-35. If you allow your facial stubble to get too long this razor will pull hair but no where near as bad as a blade. I am pleased with it and it still shaves ok with minor irritation but I have not replaced the heads and screen yet. The battery life I would rate very good for this type of shaver. If you are very picky this would make a good travel shaver if you do not want to take your clunky $100+ shaving system 
I purchased this shaver - I admit I was a bit concerned with some of the other reviewers complaining about it being rough on the face and neck. This shaver is awesome and I have had no issues with it being rough. It is very light weight and cuts my beard quickly and easily with very little pressure applied to the skin. I VERY lightly run it across my face and neck and it gives me a very quick close shave. I'm done in no time at all. I have used Braun and Norelco in the past and this shaver beats the previous shavers I have had hands down. I would highly recommend it. 
I tried Remington razors (including the R-950) and they all left very irritating red marks on my neck. I did not push hard, and kept trying for 3 weeks. I am used to using electric razors and never had this issue. My skin is not that sensitive. I was on travel to Japan (live in Texas) and it was embarrasing to say the least, looking like that in meetings. I went back to the Norelco and the shave is just as close and no irritation at all. Perhaps it's due to their movable heads that move with the curvature of your face. (they say it's patented, not sure). Please learn from my mistake 
I wasn't sure what to make of all these conflicting reviews but I needed a shaver and this shaver represented a pretty good value. I took a chance and I don't regret it. Having switched from straight edge to electric in the past, I knew my skin needed to adjust to the new treatment. Right in the box from Remington is a red warning tag that says exactly that. The first few shaves were rough ... my skin felt and looked raw in a few patches. Not a good experience and frankly it's what I suspect most of the negative reviews here are based on. However, having made this transition in the past I was intent on completing the adjustment. Well, it's been two weeks and shaves are fine. Better than fine, the shaves are very close leaving a wonderfully smooth face. The irritation is almost completely gone and really only appears when I'm too vigorous on parts of my neck with tender skin. I consider this more my fault than the shaver's. Electric shaving isn't for everyone. Furthermore, there are shavers which will treat skin more tenderly but not produce as close a shave. Given the variety of faces and shavers there is no "one size fits all". However, if you like rotary electric shaving, you don't have overly sensitive skin, and you want a really smooth close result then you should consider this shaver 
This is a little expensive but of course Amazon gives you about 30% off that. The quality, however, is excellent! Check out the label. They really pack in there all the nutrients, in the form of organic foods, that you need to survive this crazy food rescramble day and age 
I've been on the Perfect Food powder for about 15 days, now. I love the energy I have. I mix mine with fruit juice... you can get use to the taste... it taste very organic...but it's good for you 
Stopped working after one day! Show scrambled characters on the LCD. This scale was probably made for aliens since its reading is not legible to the human eye. Returned it. 
Maybe my unit was just defective, but here's my experience with this scale: First impression: It does look beautiful. Closer inspection: Although it's a German company, the manufacturing is in China. The legs and the body are cheap plastic. After switching to pounds, I placed the scale on the floor. With noone standing, the scale started displaying weight measurements that were quickly changing in the range from 1 to 30 lbs. I figured it was trying to calibrate itself and zero itself out (the manual does not mention anything about calibration or zeroing the scale out, so I am not sure). A couple of times it did display 0.0, but then it would change again. After a couple of minutes of doing this, the scale turned off. The manual says that after programming, with the last keypress, it should show 0.0, and then you have to immediately get on the scale so it recognizes you next time. For me, with the last keypress, it went back into "calibration". To make the story short... The scale showed my weight as being from 150 to 230 lbs on different measurements! (My real weight is around 210 lbs) At first I thought it was the problem with "calibration", so I tried resetting the scale and catching 0.0 reading before getting on it. Then I tried waiting, hoping it would eventually calibrate itself, but it would always turn off with the last reading not 0.0, and depending on at what point the calibration stopped, you would get a different range of readings. Getting on the scale, locks in the calibration, but even then on consecutive readings the measurements would vary within 15 lbs range. According to Soehnle website, the accuracy tolerance of those scales should be within 3 increments of .2, so even assuming it was a calibration problem, the accuracy is still unacceptable. The warranty is 3 years, not 10 as stated on Amazon website. All the features that others rave about, are there (auto-on, auto-recognize your settings), just hold your fingers crossed that it's not defective. P.S. Amazon's return policy is that it pays for the return shipping if the product is defective, if you just don't like it, you pay for the return 
I found setup very simple and took seconds to setup. I can read the scale very well while standing on it. It is well worth the money and looks so good in the bathroom. You have to show it off to friends 
The scale is beautiful and easy to read. However, it is difficult to set up properly. Read the instructions through to the end before you begin setting it up. Make sure you use the "convert" button on the back to convert from Kilos to Pounds, BUT make sure you convert to American pounds rather than British "stone" pounds! Also be very careful when you are setting up the machine to "zero" the scale properly. It is the final button push and if you press the button too hard, you will throw off the scale. I thought the scale was broke (it was weighing me ten pounds light) until I realized this. You have to pinch the area where the button is rather than just push the button or else you are pushing on the scale and causing that pressure to be zero'd. Hope that makes sense, but it is essential to getting the scale to work properly. I do love that you only have to step on it to cause it to activate and find the right person and that it's accurate to .2 pounds 
Very accurate reading with this scale, but hard to keep clean 
The scale seems to be working OK. I like the .2 pound resolution. You can usually see a weight gain or loss from day to day, unlike my other scale that read only in whole pounds. The fat, water and mussel is a nice extra and usually reads very closely from day to day 
Calvin Klein Eternity is absolutely the best for men. Easily the sexiest fragrance for the ladies. Consider it a warning guys 
It smells really good and the scent is long-lasting. I highly recommend it 
This cologne last quite a while depite some other reviews. Not too powerful. I like the smell. Recomended. 
I have been using Calvin Klein's Eternity for Men since it appeared back in 1989. I had previously used Calvin and Obsession for Men from CK, but I found a certain distinctive appeal to the clean, fresh scent of Eternity that is never overpowering or intrusive. What I especially like about it is its staying power...many colognes or EDTs lose their "charm" later in the day after application. Of course, the aroma of Eternity weakens in strength on the body from its initial spray, but even its mellowed state is recognizable. Fragrance "layering" using Eternity's Body Moisturizer and Body Powder adds to the experience. There's something to be said about finding a fragrance that works with one's body chemistry, and I know that Eternity is the one for me. The "greens, crisp jasmine, sage, and basil" notes do make a difference, and that is why it continues to be a top CK seller even now in the highly competitive and crowded fragrance market 
Recommended by the "So You'd like to start wearing cologne" guide on amazon (of which I bought and reviewed them all) this cologne is another almost perfect male fragrance. The term that comes to mind in this case is "EQ". It just has a perfect range of scents that are very well balanced between bass, mids, and high notes. It is not too citrusy like many other colognes that I happen to like, it is more serious and definitively male. Comparatively it is a more serious version of TOMMY, more sex-scent oriented than HUGO, and has a broad spicy mid-range. Being that it doesn't have an over-amount of top notes that never make it to your skin, this cologne is dependable to smell like it did when you put it on hours later. 
This pen is smooth and writes graciously. The line is alittle bolder than I anticipated. Fine writing utensil 
This is a perfect professional looking pen, right thickness, and it comes with ink refills. The only problem I see, is that the fancy box it comes in is unrealistically large to store the pen in if you even have a slight problem with desk space 
This product was ok. I ordered it to acompany a blow dryer, and although the blow dryer was a fake and did not work, the diffuser looked legit. I returned this diffuser, however I did purchase one at a convential retail store ($25 vs. 10), and it appears to be the same 
Extremely comfortable product. I use it every day 
This wedge is great for relieving back and leg strain! My only complaint is that I found the cotton cover somewhat scratchy. I would love to be able to purchase additional covers (in a choice of colors) of a softer fabric, such as French terry or cotton knit. 
this was the best priced leg wedge that I could find and it has been a great buy. The foam is firm and supports your legs well and it is wide enough that your legs aren't right beside each other. Great product. 
I have decided that a good writing instrument in the pocket is the cost of doing business in my line of work. This lightweight, thin Cross pen helps me not look back. The black satin finish is very nice, the writing quality is good for an entry-level fine pen, and the gold appointments complement clothing in the earth color range. I ruin about a shirt per year via ink leaks. This pen is not going to do that. A very handsome, economical, solid-value product from Cross 
The pen came in great shape and quickly. I am very happy with my purchase 
I have owned Cross pens before and they are always the best writing utensils I have ever used. They last forever and no matter how old the quality of the writing is always the same. 
I ordered this for my husband for Valentine's Day and not only did Amazon deliver it very quickly, but my husband LOVED it! 
I ordered these hot rollers based on previous reviews and was sorely disappointed! The rollers are extremely hot and have to cool before they can be handled. Plus, they are sooo heavy, it's hard to keep them in the hair. These are without a doubt the worst rollers I've ever owned. Would not recommend them to anyone 
I lost a set of these perfect hot curlers while traveling a while back- after depending on them for many years. I thought I'd never find them again- that they'd stopped making them! Originally I found them in my drugstore-but couldn't find them again in any store or on the web. (It would help if they called them "Hot Curlers"!!! not Hot Setters!!!) So now in the last 2 years I've tried every brand made, I think. Frustrated by these other inferior products, I finally tried another stab at finding something comparable on the web again voila! Nothing else compares to these perfect hot curlers for curling my hair quickly! Light-weight,compact,superfast heat-up,perfectly set a lasting curl, don't get tangled in your hair when you pull them out, leave your hair smooth- no lumps bumps, will travel to Europe other non-us countries with just an adaptor plug, what else can you want? Oh, the curler size is perfect. This Hot Setter 5 is a great workhorse that does a great job fast,saves me time, makes my hair look beautiful. I get lots of compliments on my hair- it's so easy! I wear a stylish do but spend just 10 to 15 minutes heating,curling brushing. I have also found that using hair products to give my hair a little extra body along with hair spray makes the hot curl really last. I lighten my hair these don't do any damage. Buy them,you won't be sorry! 
They arrived from Amazon in two days. I love it 
The first couple weeks I wasn't sure about how close it shaved. After a few weeks it definately gets better and the shave gets closer. The only thing is that there must be a cheaper alternative to the jet clean solution 
I tried to replace my old Norelco which worked pretty good. I thought going with a new Norelco would be an upgrade--not so. This thing is worse than my 5 year-old shaver. It comes with a bunch of worthless junk (jet cleaning system?). Worst of all, it rips the hair our of my face which obviously hurts!! Don't buy this thing, please 
I HAVE HAD OTHER LESS EXPENSIVE MODELS OF NOTELCO RAZORS FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN COSTS IS WORTH THE HIGH PRICE 
The Good 9170XLCC gives an excellent shave in about 5 minutes. It'll take about 2 weeks of daily use for your beard to adjust to the razor heads, but after that it's as close and clean as any blade shave. The Bad: 1. It's cheaply made. Norelco has outsourced manufacturing it shows. The frame holding the razor heads is plastic; every other Norelco I've owned (over 30 years) has been metal. The frame is supported by these weird plastic-bubble "shock absorbers" that will probably go in a year or two. The shaver has a junky, cheap feel to it. I have always gotten 5-6 years of use out of my past Norelcos; this one feels like it'll last about two years. 2. Cleaning tank is a marketing gimmick to sell $[...]/bottle cleaning solution. Way overkill. It does work OK, but the shaver gets just as clean if you rinse it under hot tap water (which you will have to do anyway because the cleaning solution leaves the razor heads coated with a slimy residue). You can pretty much throw it out after the free bottle of solution is used up. 3. I'm already on my second unit. The chip that controls the battery level indicator, recharging, etc. is flakey. The first one I had never could accurately display battery level even after 3 complete charge-discharge-recharge cycles. It'd show 15-20 minutes remaining, then just die in the middle of the shave; battery tapped out. Also, it would sometimes illuminate for no reason at all; had to turn on-off to clear it. If it happened during the night, the battery would be fully discharged by morning. So I returned it to Amazon.com (thx Amazon for great customer service!!!). The second one that they sent to me recharges continuously when you use it with the cleaning tank -- it's not supposed to charge during the 55-minute cleaning cycle, but mine does. That means that you have to catch it about 5 minutes into the cycle, after it's done it's dunking in the tank, or it'll recharge completely after every shave (which the instructions tell you not to do because it shortens battery life). More reason to toss the cleaning unit. Ridiculous on a shaver this expensive that they'd ship junk to their customers before fixing these problems. 4. The travel case is worthless for protecting the shaver on the road. It's nothing but a zippered nylon sack. You'll have to put the shaver into something else if you pack it in checked luggage or it'll be a pile of parts when you unpack. 5. They don't include a stand so when you're done shaving you lay it on the bathroom countertop. I'm using the one from my old Norelco, but if you don't have one, storage between shaves is just setting it down somewhere. Sad to see a fine old company like Norelco cheapening it's flagship product like this. I've been a customer for 30+ years, but next time I'm in the market for a shaver I will definitely comparison-shop the competition. Two stars because it does give a good shave; the rest is a mess 
Terrifc razor, and one I would buy again. But I would buy it without the cleaning system. While the cleaner does give the razor a "New" feeling when you use it, it is bulky and inconvenient to store and expensive to run considering the liquid usage 
The razor shaves pretty well, however, the cleaning unit did not function. When I called Norelco they told me that the likely cause was a chip in the razor unit that was not "communicating" with the cleaning unit -- suggesting that it's a problem that is not uncommon and that the company knows about. The replacement procedures would take up to four weeks to get a replacement razor in my hands -- leaving me without the razor in the interem -- not a good way to keep you customers satisfied. In addition, the razor uses three rubber shock absorbers that function well, but which I can see will wear down over time (and certainly well before any of the plastic components of the razor would wear out). This is poor design in my opinion. These problems have led me to return the razor for a refund. I've used Norelco razors for 30 years, but this is my last one 
Electric razors usually do not compete with a blade and shaving cream BUT this one does. The results of shaving with this electric razor is a close shave no stubble in 3 minutes ( heavy beard and neck hairs growing sideways it gets them all). I know because it tells me how many minutes i used the razor and keeps track of how many minutes are left on one charge, about 60 minutes. The self cleaning part works fine also but every time you clean you also charge the batteries. Cleaning every fourth shave means the batteries are not nearly discharged. I am concerned they will get a short memory. Other than that its great 
I had a Norelco razor 6826 which I bought five or six years ago. I was completely satisfied with that. Then I dropped it and broke the razor head carriage. It became impossible to use. I read about the 9170XL which was rated #1 by Consumer Reports, so I ordered from Amazon at a deeply discounted price. I love it. It shaves much closer than my old Norelco. Technology has improved. You won't be disappointed. It functions much more smoothly than my older razor. 
This is a great product!! It straightens beautifully even on super frizzy hair. It is cheaper than the "professional" straighteners and works the same. This is the second one that I have owned and I highly recommend it! 
I received one for Christmas 2 years ago from my aunt who is a hair stylist. After using it every day and being scared that it might die on me, I ordered another one as back up. I keep one at home and one at work for those bad hair days. So far both are working great and I'm going to order another one just in case. I recommend this to anyone who wants a high dollar straitener at a reasonable price. I've heard the CHI straiteners are good, but I've never tried them but I'm sure this is the next best thing 
I am a natural blond with somewhat wavy hair and the sometimes frizziness that comes with living in Florida's humidity. This iron, at a medium-high setting, transformed my "do" into shimmery silk that was straight as a string. The first day I used it, the result drew rave reviews from co-workers. I even had a stranger (young man in his twenties) stopping me to say, "Wow, great hair!" I researched the market extensively before buying this product. I had used cheaper type products in the past and was determined to get a top quality "pro" iron. This is it and at a very good price 
I bought one for my mom for Christmas. I tested it out on my own hair, and loved it so much, I bought one for myself the next day! I really like the swivel cord feature so that I can make loose curls...very cute 
i love my straightner at first i wasn't sure which one to buy because there are so many available. i read the reviews for this one and ordered it n i love it 
Got this iron as a back up only to find it works much better than my more costly flat iron and the smoothness out last the the others on my clients.Now would like to find a 1/2 inch one 
I've had this flat iron for about a year - never had a problem. Gets seriously hot - my thick, ultra wavy hair is totally tamed by it. Slides through with no problem, and my hair actually feels HEALTHIER now - not the heat stroked, dryed out mess I feared after such long use. 10 minutes every other day and people actually think my hair is naturally straight! A couple of people even asked if I'd had a straight perm ... that is serious results for a girl who has been fighting with a flipping, curling, wavy mess her whole life. I have medium hair and like the 1 inch - for anything longer than the shoulders I would get a 1.5 or 2 inch 
Bought this because regular towels don't dry well on our boat. These towels are different, you "pat" yourself rather than the usual way. Work really well, and dry very quickly. Wish they came in more colors, so I dyed mine - perfect 
This is a little different than I imagined it would be. You're not going to wipe it across your skin like a cotton towel, you pretty much have to blot the water off your skin - it will stick and drag across wet skin. Once most of the water is removed then you can "towel down" like you're probably used to. It does do a very good job it absorbing water and dries extremely fast. Its very light weight and even wet does not weigh anything like a wet cotton towel. It makes a very good sports towel and I'll probably be taking one with me now when I travel after experiencing the "sandpaper" towels some motels have. I also purchased the pet towel to have a different color, the only difference is it's labeled as a "Pet Towel" but is exactly the same size and material. Overall I'm pleased with them and think their worth a try but will probably want to have a large cotton towel in my bathroom - I just like the feel of a good rub down with a plush towel after a shower. 
This towel is like nothing you have ever used.....its great and would be hard to go back to a regular cotton towel now... 
I bought two of these to take to a mission trip to Haiti last fall. They were perfect for the trip -- took very little space inside my duffle bag and dried very quickly after use, even in Haiti's high humidity. And they did a great job of drying me off after my "shower" each morning. It was amazing how dry my hair was after just toweling off. I'm planning on taking them with me for my annual camping trip this summer, too, and know they'll be perfect for that as well 
I love this towel. It doesn't leave lint. Its lightweight yet very sturdy. Its the perfect size. It dries quickly and feels good. If you have never used a microfiber towel before it will be a little strange at first but you will soon grow to love it. I will not go back to conventional bath towels ever 
This is now my favorite towel ever. All the other towels in my bath are being neglected. All you have to do is wrap this wonderful, soft towel around you and you are dry. The minute it touches your body it absorbs all the moisture. I am replacing all the towels in my house with Aquis microfiber towels...one by one. They dry so fast too- so they are always ready to use the next time. I think they cut down on laundry 
I purchased this towel for my teen-aged daughter who traveled to Europe this summer with 450 other student musicians on a trip that took them to five hotels and seven countries in 16 days. She needed something compact, light-weight and quick-drying. This towel didn't take much room in her suitcase, it dried quickly and served as a small blanket for mid-day lunches in city parks. It was perfect for her trip! I plan to take the towel with me to Alaska later this summer for the same reasons 
This has added total comfort while sitting EVERYWHERE. Whether it is at home on the couch, or sitting in a car, this support item is wonderful I would recommend it to anyone. 
I've had two of these, the identical model. I had the same problem with both, after only a few weeks or months the control panel started blinking red and refused to go to a setting. I followed the directions on their site, to unplug it and plug it back in after 10 minutes, but it did nothing. I contacted Kaz and they told me I can pay to ship the pad back for a replacement. I've decided to save my money, why would I want to pay even more money for another faulty heating pad? They also mentioned it was probably due to leaving it plugged in, which I never did. I'd encourage anyone having problems to please let them know, there's obviously something wrong with this product. Let's try to save other people the hassle and money... [...] 
I purchased this heating pad in November, it is now January and the product no longer works. Don't waste your money on this. 
Boy I wish I had read the customer reviews before buying this pad... The auto off feature totally sucks, it should be a selectable feature not default. I was under the impression after reading the description that the auto off feature was only on the pro models and the one i bought didnt say anything about being a promodel... I love the size, too bad it dosnt work.. 
My first impression of this heating pad was, "GREAT!" It is large enough to wrap around a sore shoulder and well down the back, it has nice controls and four heat settings, and turns off after an hour or so (for safety). Unfortunately, it was only 3 weeks before it stopped working. I exchanged it for another unit (thought maybe it was a fluke). The replacement lasted about two months of almost daily use, then died. It appears that the controller simply burns out. I would not recommend this heating pad 
my husband is a wheelchair user and loved these, said it keeps his eyes warm while driving down the stree 
I bought the goggles and was excited by the look. They are kind of "Riddick" like. They had disappoiinting performance when I rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face. They did float and so I found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened. I gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing. They definately are not for extreme sports. They are also too big for casual use as sun glasses. 
I was a bit apprehensive about spending this much money on an acne "device", but I was desperate.. I had a big date in two days and I was starting to develop two large cystic zits right on my forehead. I was completely floored by the device, my zits were gone by the day of my date. The Zeno works as described by the other reviews, I used it about every 4 hours. I found that it was most effective in immediately reducing the swelling. I dont usually write reviews, but the Zeno definetly worked for me and I will recommend it to my friends. I started out with the 60 count cartridge, but refills are only $25, about the same as a bottle of Proactiv Cleanser 
I bought this product for my teenage daughter who does not have terrible acne, but does get a pimple here there. The pimples make her self-conscious. She tried Proactiv but it was too strong although it dried out the pimples, it also made her skin burn. So far the Zeno has been great. She only needs to use it on pimples when she has them. Not every day. When she does use it the pimples dissappear overnight her skin doesn't get overdried sensitive 
Nowadays people are more cost-consious than ever when it comes down to buying something that's worth every penny. Simply put, this is a device that people should be confident in investing in. The Zeno is a great device for ONLY those who have acne consisting of cysts that: take forever to rise to the surface of the skin, are painful, are embarrasing, and take forever to perish from the skin. After a double-cycle treatment on a cyst that is just beginning under the skin, the pain goes away (yes, that means breaking the rules of the directions which say only one cycle. This works more efficiently, basically). Once done, the majority of the bacteria inside the cyst will die, causing the sequence of the cyst to stagnate and even reverse itself (often slowly, but surely). It also becomes less visually apparent, heals faster, and has a much lesser chance of leaving a scar. Thus, you can actually walk outside your home feeling a bit more confident in your appearance! The only complaint I have is the fact that it's time-consuming for the device to start up, but it's technology... 
It helps you dry and burns the wattery thing inside your face out. This is a non toxic device used to heat up the pimples until it get small and dry. This product is better than Proactiv. Proactive does not work on my face instead it irritates and get worst. Try to wash your face with Dove skin soap for more than 1hr to soften your face and remove the pus. Then, path it dry and use Zeno, and don't over use this product because it might hurt and burn your skin. Failure to use this product properly might cause 1st Degree burn. Never use any chemicals on your face while using this product. For excessive large pimples, I see some people apply a clean duct tape on their face, keep it for 3-8 hrs and remove it. You would notice that all pus are lying on your face and you just need to clean it using clean water and a skin soap. 
Zeno worked on my cystic acne. It took four days, but the cyst is gone! After the first full day, there was a noticable reduction in pain and size. After two days, there was just a small red bump. Three days almost nothing. Fourth day, completely gone. The best thing about the Zeno treatments, is that for me it immediately takes away the pain of the cyst. It also reduced the swelling much quicker than if I did not use the Zeno. I had a friend tell me to leave the Zeno in place even after the ending beep. The tip seems to get a little warmer, but it seemed to help in my situation. I held the Zeno in place until I heard the continuous beeping. Please use your own common sense on this. I don't consider the tip too warm, but for some people it may be too painful. I used it every three or four hours for four days. I used it mostly for pain relief from the cyst. I never expected the cyst itself to go away. 18 treatments and the cyst is gone with no scarring. Wish I would have had this sooner. For me it worked. I definitely did not have the "one time and it is gone" experience. Of course, mine was a huge cyst (one half of an inch wide) on my chin, so I was diligent with the treatments, and sure enough, it is completely gone. I made sure I used the Zeno until there was absolutely no bump left at all. Without the Zeno, it probably would have taken a more than a week to come to an ugly head, and then another month for it to heal (probably with a scar). Is it worth it? For me it is. I hate the inconvenience of going to the dermatologist and then waiting in the office for a cortisone shot. Also my dermatologist's office is closed on weekends which according to Murphy's law is when I tend to get the monster pimples, so this is perfect for me. The tips will be expensive, but considering the cost of gas, time, and office visit, it is still a much cheaper alternative. Another thing I liked, was that I could use it over makeup. So, while I covered the redness with concealer, I was still able to zap the cyst right over the concealer. Pretty nifty device 
Yes, it's basically a recharable battery and a heating element. Yes, it is expensive. And Yes, I do believe the cartriges are a scam to give the comapany an ongoing revenue flow. I really wanted to rip on this thing and call it junk, but I have to admit IT WORKED. I've tried it about 5 times and it's helped tremendously. On a couple of occasions, it actually did work overnight! Amazing. So I'll gladly put up with the price tag because ultimately my social life is worth it. Plus, it's cheaper than going to the dermotologist (who in my experience, really can't do a damn thing.) For people who have tried all the other lotions and pills and gimmicks, it's worth a try 
I left a review on the 90 count device, which is the same device but more uses in the tip. Zeno works for me, like a charm. The trick I've noticed, and Zeno advocates, is to catch them when they're first starting to arrive - before you can see them, but you feel them. Be proactive and it'll do what it says, I guess for most people. The other reviewer here points out that it says "for most people" or "for most acne", as if this is a loop hole. Any device like this, most devices/tools in general don't work for everyone. Some straightening irons damage one persons hair while making another's sleek and shiny. Some hair growth therapies work for some, not for others. So it's a toss up. My guess is if you have random annoying pimples, but not something you'd consider and acne problem, and you catch these pimples BEFORE they really develop and show, this device is for you 
I have had a few "cheap" humidifers like this before. Most use filters. And none of them gives out visible water steam like this one. And this one really works! In one hour, it was able to raise the humidity of my average size bedroom (with door opened) from 31% to 40%. And when I left it on overnight at the smallest steam volume setting, the humidity in my room was raised to 61%! I have never seen something quite like this before. And it's very quiet except for the water dripping sound which i take it like it is raining outside. I don't have the problem of water spilling all over like some of the other reviewers did. I think they didn't screw the bottom cap on properly. There is only a little bit of moisture around the base but nothing serious. The only regret? Can't preset a humidity and stop the steam it reaches there. But then, with this price, what more can you expect? I rate it a 5-star 
This humidifier works quite well, but you need to leave it running for a while before the room is humid enough. Very quiet, and the blue light is cool. The dampness at the base can be taken care of by placing towels around it. Would have given five stars if it was faster 
Was looking for an ultrasonic humidifier since I like to see the moisture. I was a bit scared since most have mixed reviews, but so far this is working as advertised and I like the blue night light feature 
This is the first time I am purchasing Humidifier. When I start using it, it mess up whole floor with water. I have to use a BIG sheet to collect all the water and then pour it in the morning. Then, the tank cap is not opening. Now I am using the small hole to fill the water. I will NOT recommend to any one 
Can't adjust mist volume like every other humidifier out there on the market, oh sure... you can close off the opening where the mist comes out which results in water streaming down the front of humidifier...with a towel under unit its ok.....the night light feature is cool..glowing blue water ..but all and all not so hot...give it a big OK 
We bought this thinking it would be a great product. We were able to get steam out of it for awhile, but we had to nurse it along. At times it drained out onto the carpet; other times it produced no steam. Even with nusing it, the humidifier broke down after three months and now we can't use it at all. Hope others have better luck with it than we did. 
I bought this for my daughters room and I do really like it. The vapor stream shows that it's working as soon as you turn it on and within a few hours my daughters room was warm and dewy. The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is that after letting it run all night (my mistake) I woke up to a mess of condensation all around the base of the humidifier. The table and floor had to be mopped up. I'd certainly buy this again but never run it for long periods unsupervised 
I stumbled across L'Occitane in the Houston Bush Airport and have been hooked ever since. Amazon had a fantastic deal on this gift set ... I bought 3 just for me! The lotion is so luscious and the soaps were a perfect compliment. Try L'Occitane, if you dare! (It is a little pricey but worth it... 
This perfume is truly the best one out there. Probably the only ones that come close are Hugo, Armani Code and Polo Blue. Great for anytime of the day or night. Always is a favorite among the ladies. 
It seems to be a good scent for any man. It is a very clean scent, but also quite sensual at the same time 
Whenever I smell this on my husband I just want to relax with him on the sofa and snuggle. Sappy but true 
My husband loves this cologne, and the price was unbeatable. Great deal 
I have used Davidoff for many years now and at this price ~ 22 bucks for a 2.5 ounce spray it's a great buy. Shipment was in good condition and I am looking around for other great EDT buys on Amazon now.. 
I purchased this item as a gift for my brother. The scent is oceany/watery and is appropriate for young/middle aged men. It became over-popular some years ago, but I think the smell is fresh and nice, and worth the popularity. I received the package two days ago, and surprisingly that EDT package had a gift shower gel (75ml)included. On the box, it was written "travel set". I don't know if all the packages has the same gift included. But to see a free gift in the pack was a very nice surprise for me. Good deal 
Ok so i purchased this to charge all my batteries. As it says clearly - Energizer e2 Charger for AA AAA Rechargeable Batteries with Car and Home Adapter 4 AA Batteries. However it only charges AA not AAA be aware amazon has mis marked this product 
this product is what you want from Energizer. The batteries life on digital camera and wii controllers is great. even 3x than normal batteries. the car adapter make it perfect for travels. the base is very think, so is very portable too. the only thing i can complain is that the home charge AC adapter is huge compare to the base o the car AC adapter. but the charge time is really quick too. this product is a most for any AA digital camera or Wii owner 
This portable charger is easy to use and works very quickly with no glitches. A light comes on when you start charging and goes off when done. Comes with TWO cords, one for home and one for the car! This is really great for the photographer on the go! I'm very happy with this product 
The product is in good shape. Got good value for money. The shipping was fast and services good. Good buy overall 
not much to write about other then the fact it works... the end 
well designed charging device in very good quality. i've bought other two battery chargers, none of them better than this. one of them the plastic cover even melted, deformed and sagged in. both are very hot during recharging. not this energizer charger, always cool to the touch during charging. the snap down and snap on switch for aaa or aa batteries is the best and user-friendly design 
I bought this battery and charger combo as a birthday present for a young friend who recently got a digital camera. She complained that she was going through so many batteries so I gave her this battery/charger combo and she loves it. Now she spends a lot more time taking photos and less time replacing batteries 
This table was just as described, arrived promptly even during the holiday season and was easy to assemble. It moves easily from bedside to chair, is easy to clean and was just what I needed for my elderly parent who is mobile, but likes to keep a lot of different items that he uses at his bedside. It is also great if he needs to eat a meal in that area instead of his kitchen. Thanks 
This was a very good deal! It is strong enough to hold my 23" TV and DVD player and allows me to enjoy movies in bed, up close witout my glasses! Also it was half the price of all other sites I found it advertised on, and Amazon included free shipping! (My wife would have preferred it was attractive perhaps made of wood, but I can't really subtract stars for that. 
fabulous gift for females ... easy to operate ... less mess .... worth i 
Terrible product: 1. Water will not stay warm nor will it heat up 2. The attachments will not stay... Attached 3. During operation, water splashes out. Even with the water level below the recommended water level. This product was not worth what I paid. In fact, based upon the 3 issues mentioned it is not a bargin at any price. Buyer beware 
One star is too much. It doesn't work at all, in fact it kept me up more than my insomnia. Puts you to sleep fast? Myth!!!!! Helps keep you asleep longer? Myth!!!! Waste of money. Where's the website? Doesn't exist. Too bad they don't have a money back guarantee! 
Sleep MD works great for me. Helps me get to sleep and there's no Sleeping Pill Hangover. But when I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep I use "MidNite Herbal Supplement 
After trying this product, I am disappointed. It is not all that it is hyped up to be. Instead of helping me sleep better, it caused me to be more awake. I tossed and turned after taking this product MORE than I did before taking this product. I will have to find something better or more effective 
I have always had problems with falling asleep and staying asleep. I have tried multiple medications which most of the time made my legs feel jittery and my mind tired. I discovered sleep MD at a local pharmacy and bought it without much hope of it working. I was wrong! I have never slept so well in my life and I pretty much fell asleep within 30-45 minutes. I am absolutely convinced that this is the best sleep product I have ever used (including prescription strength). I wake up in the morning without feeling groggy which is a major plus. Now for the part that sucks, other people must have discovered it too because I have been unable to find it again. Hence, my getting Sleep MD at Amazon 
SleepMD REALLY WORKS!! Im serious, it actually works. I have severe insomnia. I went to go see the nerologist and I even went to a sleep study. I was suffering from severe daytime fatigue as a result of my multiple awakenings. The polysomnogram showed that I was having 17 spontaneous awakenings per hour. Although to me it only seemd like 2 to three awakenings every 2 hours. The sleep study was inconclusive as to what was causing my insomnia, so the Nerologist prescribed me an antidpressant(Trazadone 25mg)in a low dose for a sedative effect. Instead of taking the Trazadone. I wanted to research an Natural Alternative to presciption drugs, because I wanted to avoid the side effects. Well I came arcoss SleepMD and decided to give it a try. It was the best decision I have ever made! SleepMD has stopped my spontaneous awakenings, and it taste great! There are only two negatives aboout SleepMD and thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The first negative is, I have to take more than the recommended dose for it to work (I take 1 pill, and cut another pill in half). But that might be due to my body type (Im 6'5" 200lbs). The second negative thing about SleepMD is that it only helps me stay asleep. I usually have to find my own way to get to sleep. But once im sleep, SleepMD helps me sleep the whole night through, only waking up when my alarm goes off. That in itself makes it more than worth the purchase price for me. 
Better than those little tiny heads. Who likes little tiny heads? I don't like little tiny heads 
works well first for my boy and now my girl. Could we chance it with a lesser diaper? Maybe, but WHY when these work so well, and no blowouts (parents know what that can mean ... 
Great product! I have been only used this Pampers Cruisers for my two boys. This doesn't leak at all.. 
It's worth every penny to have diapers delivered directly to the door since this is an item used daily at our house. With super saver shipping (a purchase over $25.00) there is no cost for shipping. It ends up being 27 cents per diaper for a box of 160 size 3 pampers cruisers. The last two times I have ordered this item, it has been delivered in two days! I am extremely happy with the service amazon has provided and I recommend this item to anyone in the market for diapers 
These pampers are pretty good, I found out that some diaper brands work better on boys and some brands work better on girls. I have a little boy and I like the Pampers because they have a Little more padding in the front of the diaper and I close the tapes lower down on the diaper waist line and I have no leaks. The only thing with these diapers that i didnt like was that they left some gel on My baby's skin. 
I really enjoyed ordering this product online because it lasted me a long time. Before ordering this product I was having to go to the store more frequently to buy diapers. I had looked everywhere for a box of this size and was rather impressed when I found it here at this site. Love this product! M 
I expected it to suck the gunk out of my skin...Or at least bring it close to the surface so that i could easily take it off....it didn't..too bad for me 
Good value for the money. Rollerballs not very effective, but scratcher works. Hasn't been destroyed by the kids yet 
I'm very happy with this product. It's very well made, feels good in your hands, and most of all does a great job. I've only used it a couple of times but so far I have no complaints. 
This trimmer is decent quality. The battery hold a charge well, and the trimmer trims well. My only two gripes are as follows: 1. You have to remove the trim guard to use the pop-up trimmer. This is a true pain, as you have to hold the adjustment wheel to ensure that the adjuster doesn't turn when removing the guard - or do as I do and just remove the guard and when putting it back on recheck and adjust the adjusting wheel as necessary. I had an old Norelco (I think) that did not have this problem. Also, the adjustment wheel is easily "accidentally" adjusted by brushing up against it. Not a big deal, but my old Norelco had a twist grip type of adjustment that stayed put. 2. The size, seems a little large and can be difficult to maneuver for fine trimming (moustache area). Overall and happy with the product and would recommend it 
I have been using this product close to a month now and it works very well. I'm very satisfied with the product. One complete charge would last me close to 2-3 shavings of 20-25 minutes each. Its nine levels of trimming lengths are great for a close shave. Its pop-up trimmer is another good feature. I strongly recommend it for regular use 
I bought this product because my wife threw my charger away for my old one. It wasn't a total lost because my last one lasted about 6 years. I have been very satisfied with this new. It does all that it promises 
I spent a long time searching for a shaver that promised me a 5 o clock shadow look. After doing extensive research, i ruled out the "vaccum" models , since i didnt expect to keep a long beard. I wanted, just enough for a 2-3 day stubble. 1) Build quality - The MB300 felt solid in my hand . 2) Efficiency - Well , one of the reviewers had said that the Remington MB300 is not suitable for very short facial hair and i agree with him . Out of the box , this is true, even with the setting set to 1(Lowest) . Though reminton says that the 1-2 settings gives a 5 o clock shadow, i dont agree . But if one removes the protector , then one can get a close trim. I wanted an even shorter trim. Finally, the pop trimmer gave me the look that i wanted , a smart 2-3 days look stubble. Were it not for the pop up trimmer, i might have returned this one. Guys who plan to buy the MB400 should not that , it doesn't have a pop up trimmer. 3) The first few times that i used it , i experienced slight skin irritation .I attribute this to my inability to use the trimmer correctly.Its better now. Overall, i am happy "now". A dual voltage option would have been great . 
I like the product, however one of the guides at the tip broke off while using it. I hope replacement guides are available 
This item has been fabulous. Since using it, I've gone from real bad skin burn to smooth shave, just like the product says. The pre-shave oil helps too. Its time we men re-discovered our good old father's shave and dumped the disposable razors and shaving creams. 
I've tried a couple of other brands and those always seem underpowered. This one is different - it has plenty of power in the massage motor. Some of the shapes are a little weird for no apparent anatomical reason, but this feels like a pulse rather than like a buzzer 
Okay, let's see if I can write this review so as not to offend Amazon's fastidious editors... Guys, if you want a plug-in massager that will please your wife or girl friend, the Hitachi Magic Wand is what you need. However -- gals, if you want a plug-in massager that will please your husband or boy friend -- the Panasonic EV2510K is the one! Why? Because the Panasonic is more powerful than the Hitachi, and its hard plastic roller head is better suited to a man's, um, contours. In addition, the Panasonic is quiet and causes no video interference, a selling point in case you augment your "massage" sessions with some video stimulation... The only reason I don't give the Panasonic five stars is that previous "Panabrators" have proven less than reliable; typically they seem to last about a year before they conk out. Still, get an EV2510K, and you'll have a most enjoyable year 
This is a solid well conceived and manufactured massager. It takes all the days pain out of my feet in about 5 minutes which is worth the price alone. Designed with a pronounced hook that is best on self massaging your shoulders, the hook is not so great that it makes massaging others difficult. The 2 front wheels keep it from abraiding clothing and are good for rolling up and down the back. This is best done sitting and reaching over the shoulders. The lower back can be reached holding it with both hands on the same side. It has 2 speeds which are a little slower than the last one I had, these are OK for me and better for my wife. The green is too bright but I can overlook it 
During the very first use the head popped off the handle! Doesn't look like there was very much adhesive applied when it was put together so I'm going to try re-gluing. But having that happen right away was a real disappointment so I can't recommend this item. 
It is the smoothest you will ever be. Buy it!! 
This one lives up to its advertising, folks! It's quick, easy, painless, and quite effective. My advice is to shave with a regular razor one day to get the required stubble needed by the Seiko (anything longer won't get cut), and then use the Seiko before your shower every day thereafter. Bikini area is a hard place to keep smooth! This electric razor makes it MUCH easier 
This is the Lexus of shavers! When you first pick up the Seiko Cleancut, you know this is a serious shaver. It is heavy compared to low-cost shavers, and that is because it has a quality motor. The shaver fits nicely in your hand, and when you turn it on it has a nice hum, without the buzzing rattle that you get from cheap shavers. It gives a nice smooth shave, and does not bite or pinch even the softest of skin. It is powered by a C battery, that is easy to replace, and actually comes with the new purchase. Now, let's be clear, when trimming hair, you will want to first use a trimmer first, and I recommend the Seiko Femini. Use the Femini and Cleancut for removal of unwanted hair, whether in the underarm, or along the bikini line. The Cleancut is a high-quality shaver that you will love and will give you excellent service. 
I use a wipe warmer and these don't work very well with it. Other than that, they're grea 
these are my favorite wipes, and we use the tushies diapers again, too. they have no alcohol,citric acid, petroleum, and other stuff that irritates my baby's skin. as far as i researched, these are the most natural you can get.they are a little small, but when i think, no chemicals, it;s stars from me 
They work great. I had never used them before. I like the ingredients and they are very moist. They are a little thin, the wipe is not that thick, but that is the only minus. Great price here too 
Plain and simple... a product that does what it's designed to do 
These calipers are not up to any form of reliable measurement, because its premise is far too simple. The instructions include no equations of any kind, and the pinch is intended only for the abdominal skin-fold. Once you measure the skinfold, you take the result (in millimeters) and compare to a color-coded chart which pairs a man/woman's age and measurement to show the bodyfat percentage within the colored stripes of (ideal, overweight, obese, etc.). This is too simple for a bodyfat measurement. There was no regard for body weight, height, or other skin-fold areas. It would have been nice if the instructions at least included equations so that I could measure myself more accurately on my own--but, no. Granted, the "click" feature is pretty cool, and lets you know exactly how much pressure to apply while measuring. However, if you're a trainer or someone seriously trying to lose body fat and measure your progress, you'll need normal calipers with formulas. This is too basic. A toy 
The product is great and I received it right on time. Great seller 
This little plastic product is so quick and easy to measure your body fat percentage that you almost feel like it can't be that accurate. But just for kicks I had my body fat measured with one of those fancy electronic machines several times before using the Accu-Measure calipers. The average of three readings for the electronic device was 26% body fat while the Accu-Measure showed 25.5%. Not bad considering this product is a whole heck of a lot CHEAPER than the electronic body fat machines. I'm trying to get my body fat down to single digits and these Accu-Measure calipers will help me track my progress. VERY affordable and they REALLY work 
Good one. Thought it is pain in xxx, to calculate the formula, but if you build a exceel sheet with formulas, all you need is plug in the number of readings of this tester..that's it. 
This fat caliper is sure to be used by you on a weekly basis if you want to evaluate your fat levels. Recomended by Tom Venuto (www.TomVenuto.com) this caliper is what the pros use, and they're easy enough for you to use as well. After a few tries you will become consistent with using them just above your supperilliac crest (hip bone). Anyone can use it! Simply squeeze, listen for the *click* and then read your measurement. There are no biased readings as you would get from pressure-sensitive models, especially for the ones that cost so much more. Get this caliper and start measuring your lean body mass / body fat percent consistently today! 
My hairdresser shocked me by recommending this product for thinning hair. Thinning hair? I had no idea, but I realized it was true because in the light you could see just how very thin it had gotten. When it was wet, I felt like I had just a very small amount of hair left. I was so sad. I bought this product as he suggested, and it seems to be working for me! I've been using it for just over 4 months now and I have new hair growth sticking up in places that I had not realized my hair had been thinning. Hurray. I am so pleased to see my hair coming back in! Good luck to all that try it- other reviewers did not always have the same results I had, so I feel very fortunate. I hope others that try it have the same results that I have had so far. (I also use this in combination with its companion product, Nioxin Scalp Therapy. 
I absolutely love this trimmer!!! I read a review on Amazon about this product, which rated it very poorly. Despite that, I decided to give it a try. I had one of those $10 micro trimmers, but it was not doing a good job and I needed a new one. Trusting Epilady to make a good product, I bought the Lady B. It has been doing a great job for me, and for the price, it must be the best trimmer out there. My friend had another large trimmer, but the epilady one is much more delicate, and I have never suffered from rashes or razor burns like I used to with other trimmers. This one is quiet and fast, and I am so ready for the warm weather now! I would recommend it 
I first tried this product in one of the many kits made by Burt's Bees (which are a great way to get started if you are new to Burt's Bees, a fabulous line!) and was instantly hooked. I get eczema on my eyelid and have had trouble finding something to help soothe and prevent eczema breakouts until I tried this, which I use with the royal jelly eye cream, also made by Burt's Bees. This cream truly does vanish, not leaving your skin feeling greasy as some creams do, but is not so light that it barely moisturizes. This is the best face moisturizer I have tried, even compared to expensive brands I have used 
Not as good as the response I get from Dolce and Gabanna, but its good 
The contour twist pillow was as advertised. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I have always been very pleased with all my Amazon.com orders and all of the Amazon.com suppliers. In my opinion Amazon.com is the BEST shopping experience on the web 
I really like this Twist Pillow, it conforms to my neck and stay "put" all night, I think though I would prefer it be a tad bit shorter in length. Great pillow for anyone, esp if one has neck/back problems 
We bought 2 of these pillows for an 8 hour trip on a plane. They were perfect! I was able to bend and twist it to hold up my head, but also place it in between the seat for a pillow at the same time. It worked so well I got lots of good sleep without my neck cramping. We even used it on my 3 yr old! It was a GREAT purchase. The only thing I was worried about was getting through security with it, but there ended up not being a problem at all with that. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
This is an excellent product/buy. You can bend it to suit yourself for the most comfortable sleep. I bought it for travel, but have used it in bed, while watching TV, etc. I love it 
I saw this in a tv ad and had to buy it. I sleep on my side and I've tried every leg pillow out there, but I always seem to kick them away during my sleep. The countour twist pillow is great because I can partially wrap it around one of my legs so I can't kick it away. I see how it would be good in cars/planes as well for neck support - but I bought it for my legs and haven't tried it for travel. 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it was a little longer 
This is my 3rd hairsetter in the past 20 years. I won't use anything else. My first one was when it first came out and we had to put salt in the machine with the water! I was panicing when I couldn't find it in the stores anymore. I hung onto my last set for far too long! It was coming apart. Soooooo happy I found it here! 
Wonderful! Simple to use with rollers heated one at a time, so the base unit is small. Each only takes 4-10 seconds of heating. Put one in your palm, take the heated one, and instantly put the next one on the unit in one move. Once you roll with the heated one, the next one is ready. The plastic shield clips are easy to use. The only downer is the roller variety. You get 6 of each: jumbo, large, medium, small and petite. I really just want the first three. I wish they had sets of jumbo-large-medium and medium-small-petite. After I tried it once, I ordered more rollers. You may want to take all of our word for it, and order more at the same time as the unit to take advantage of the free shipping. Nonetheless, fabulous and mine forever and ever 
this is my third set of rollers from caruso. bought first one almost 20 yrs. ago when it was first invented. love it doesn't damage hair, works fast. curls last a long time. 
This is my 3rd one in about 12 years, I won't use anything else. I use it daily. It is gentle on my hair lightweight. I was in a panic when I couldn't locate another Caruso hairsetter in the retail stores or beauty supply stores. So happy to have my new replacement!! 
Have a set of my own. Bought these for a friend with long hair. Works great, less damaging to hair 
Easy to use, gentle on my hair, could use more rollers in the set though 
I was very hesitant to buy this product because of the cost. But after giving it a try I have decided that it is well worth the price not to have an ugly ingrown hair bump. 
I used to get ingrown hairs after I shaved and although I still get a few, this product has exponentially decreased them. It is a little more money than other products but it actually does work! I use it every time I get out of the shower, even when I do not shave. Give it a shot, I truely am a happy customer and am about to reorder another bottle 
I have only been using this gel for about four days and already I'm seeing results! My hair tends to curl and hide under my skin, plus it's usually thick hair. I have had an ingrown hair for, I don't even know how long - probably years, I always had a huge bump and I would try to dig out the hair with no luck. After two days of using this gel, all of the sudden, a long hair emerged from this bump in my skin and the bump finally went away! I recommend this to everyone ... I am buying more for my friends and family 
Fast delivery. Product in good condition. Really works. Loved the results. My son was home for a visit from the Navy and thought it was so great, he took it with him to share with the other officers on his ship 
Works as stated and all though it is a tad on the expensive side it works and works well, no burning or stinging at all and helped get rid of my dark spots too. All and all a good produc 
It is pricey but hell I woulda paid double cause it cleared up my face in 4 days and I cant tell you how much of a pain ingrowns were to my skin. GOOD STUUF 
This stuff works great. I have had razor bumps since I was 16 and it had made me feel insecure in a way cause I had always thought that I wasnt ever at my 100% because of it. After using Princereigns for 1 week half of my bumps were gone and in 2 weeks it all cleared up and I started to feel great about myself and more confident it is remarkable. I just had to share this info because I know theres alot of guys out there that feel like me. Oh and P.S. I also tried all the other BS out there like "Tend Skin" aka liquid Fire and Magic Shave, Min roller and even Nads (I was desperate) but as you all know they are all garbage 
I had heard of this in LA before and its in all the goodie bags at these award ceremony's but It was never available to us regular folk. I had tried Tend Skin (horrible) and It just burns the hell out of my skin. Princereigns worked miracles for me in 2-3 days. It removed all my ingrown hairs and bumps and I also had those little dark dots where hair is starting to grow and I didnt notice them anymore. I can go 3 days without shaving or trimming down there now and its not noticeable. WOW, living in LA I am ofetn in a bikini or top with sarong so it is key for me. I highly recommend this stuff for all the girls out there 
This lumbar support cushion is excellect for long car rides. It countours to and cushions the back well and lessens back pain. We received the item quickly in a well wrapped box 
The lumbar support cushion was close to what I thought it would be and was delivered in very good time. In fact, earlier than expected 
If you love loose leaf tea, you will love this stainless steel mesh tea ball. There is a nice little latch (you can sort of see on the left of the tea ball at the top) which keeps all the tea leaves safely in the tea ball and never lets them into your tea pot or mug. I fill this with my favorite Jasmine tea or Provence Rooibos, which is always loose leaf it seems, and then hang the metal hook over the edge of the mug so I can easily remove it. Just let the tea ball sit in the mug for a bit and then swirl it around and remove it. I suggest rinsing it immediately and then opening it to let it dry out. Mine has never rusted! I would not put this in a dishwasher! I just think it has so many uses, you can also use it in a hot apple cider when you want to add cloves and pieces of cinnamon or you can use it filled with herbs when making a stock. I just love it. ~The Rebecca Revie 
We have had this product about 2 months. It alleviated my sinus issues quite a bit. It not only keeps the air from being too dry, it keeps the room lit nicely. Its the perfect amount of light to see if you want to get up in the night, but not so bright it keeps you awake. I also like that it has to be refilled daily because i am always misting fresh water into the air 
Neat little machine, lasts for several hours. Best for small rooms. Love the easy refill. Tired of lugging the big ones around 
What a great humidifier. The small size of it allows me to place it on my night table or dresser and it doesn't get in the way. It holds just the right amount of water for a full nights sleep and I am thrilled that it is whisper quiet. There is nothing worse than getting a product home, turning it on and hearing an annoying drone sound while you attempt to sleep. Thanks for caring so much 
This really kicks out the steam from such a small machine. The blue light is nice and comforting. It is easy and light to tote around with me, as I fly every week for business. I can definitely tell the difference in the quality of my breathing at night, with this humidifier working. The only thing I would change is that it does blow out cold air, rather than the usual warm air, which I personally prefer. Definitely worth the money 
I have had this humidifier for 3 months now. Works great. I had an initial niggling problem. After using it for the first time, the humidifier did not work again. The trick is to take the base unit, fill it with water, swish it a little and drain off the water. Ever since it works well. You will be surprised at the size of the unit, it is pretty small barely 8in tall and 8 in across. With a full canister it runs for 8-9 hrs (depending on the dryness in the room). There is no digital control on this model to set the humidity level. But at the price its a bargain 
I was so tired of clumsy, unattractive humidifiers for the office. This Medisana is perfection - it is chic, effective when placed relatively close to your main work area, and has NO filters!! Very little cleaning (I just wipe dry every night before leaving). I LOVE that the tiny tank will fit under my work's water filter, which means easy distilled water at hand, without having to lug water jugs in from home or anything. I have a large office, about 16x16, and did have a problem with still having dry eyes when the Medisana was on the top of a medium-sized bookshelf across from my desk. I have sinced moved it to the right wing of my desk and have been in love ever since. I just keep the spout turned away from me so it's not blowing directly on me. 
I like the Aqui products they are very nice. This is a gift so I don't know how the person will like it - but based on previous purchases, I think it will be a hit 
I had bought this and the Aquis hair turban as gifts for a friend's birthday and she loved them so much that she asked for another set for Christmas to bring to the gym 
I bought this today at my local Savon drugs. It comes with just enough charge to let you sample what it can do. You really must charge before use. This product works wonders to alleviate...stress...kinks...etc. It's pleasing to look at and touch. It appears to be me well made. I recommend it 
We like the sensitive wipes and that they are soft and thick, but sometimes a bit of the material will come off the wipe and stick to our childrens bottom. Other than that we love them. 
For the paranoid parent like myself, these wipes seemed liked the best fit. They my baby loves them, they don't dry out her skin and it is thick enough to pick up some major messes. My only issue is the cost that is why I bought in bulk during the last Amazon sale. Too bad they don't have the refills online for a decent price 
These are the only baby wipes I would use for my baby girl's sensitive newborn skin. For the first few of weeks I would only use cotton pads and previously boiled water to clean by baby's bottom but I then ventured to experiment with these wipes specially made for newborns and they were perfect. Fragrance free and designed for newborns sensitive skin. Highly recommended 
This is a deeply satisfying product. Not only does it kill flies, it does so with a bright flash and the crack of electricity. What could be better? True, the battery door is not particularly well secured, but it's not a big deal. There are actually three grids in the paddle. The two outer ones have large mesh that allows insects to pass inside, while the middle one uses much smaller mesh. Voltage is applied between the center grid and both outer grids. I haven't made an effort to poke my fingers into the grids, but it looks like you could give yourself a shock...if you worked at it. My advice: Don't. 
this is a really cool product expecally if you hate flies its bit of a challange to get a fly that has landed but it the air its not so bad and fruit flies they get fried with one wack. they main problem i have found with this is if you try to hit more than one fly at a time it does not work and the battery cover keeps falling of i have to use furnace tape on the handle and remove it when its time to change the batteries but im still glad i bought this one i may try the other one that uses the c size batteries that will show them flys but this one does a pretty good jo 
If you get infested with pantry moths - and anyone who owns a pet that eats seed likely has been or is infested - this works like a charm on them. I doubt the current is strong enough for large insects, but I've killed thousands of moths, numerous mosquitos and even a couple of small earwigs. If there's a flaw or flaws, it's that the batteries die quickly and the cover for the battery housing does not stay latched. I had to tape mine shut. Bottom line - I can't get fumigated for these moths due to small pets and my cats. I have to do daily combat with them to keep their numbers low, and I couldn't do it without this crazy electric tennis racket! By the way, my primary weapon against these little brown beasts is the Bugzooka. Excellent product 
This is a perfect description of what this product has become and the people who use them. After purchasing two battery charged water piks, the first was an Inter-Plak, and having them both die within weeks, I looked at the comments and found everyone has the same problem. What's worse is that the nickel cadmium battery can't be thrown out without environmental harm, they have to be returned to a qualified dealer. Of course, most people probably don't do this so these companies are not only defrauding their customers, they are spoiling the enviornment with disposable products that can't be safely disposed. I just bought the model that attaches to the shower. Don't know how it will work out, but it won't burn out. It won't foul the environment. It doesn't use electricity and it won't clutter my counter. Its considerably cheaper. It seems like the way to go, doesn't it? 
We've used this model in the past and it started to get very very loud. We thought because it was old. So we took another stab and bought a new one, exact same problem. It was extremely loud that my neighbor would hear it. The hose was shaking vigorously. Without trying a second time, I returned it to the store the next day 
I am giving this a 4star, as I like the product, however, it does give you a bath until you get this thing started.. ha ha. I never had a Waterpik with so much spray.. I think it's a good system and definetly for the money a good product.. It does the job.. Fast shippment 
This product works wonders on the mouth. I bought it primarily to use as a sinus washing tool but the atachment has yet to arive. If you have allergies or problems with sinus infections if you just put in a little salt to the warm water and pump it through your sinuses using the sinus atatchment they work wonderfuly to clean out your nose. Stuffy to breathing clear in minutes. It's also great to clean out your teeth instead of using floss as it is more fun than floss 
I had a Waterpik many years ago and it was a very good product. After many years of service it died. When I went shopping to replace it I decided to save a few bucks and buy a cheaper competitor. BIG MISTAKE ! The competitor did not hold enough water to adequately flush out the deposits without having to refill it nor did it have the power the Waterpik's have. It got returned and I got the WP-65 and am happy again. You would be surprised by the amount of debris that is hiding at your gum line that brushing (even power brushing) can't remove. You also gain the benefit of having your gums massaged by the pulsating action. Your dental hygene is not complete until you have finished up with the WaterPik.. 
This is my second WaterPik. I find this model to work well however it is very loud and vibrates too much. The results of using it are well worth it. 
We are pleased with the quality of this product as well as all the accessories that were included. Would buy again 
I recently bought this clipper set and it works fine. Havent had the chance yet to really test the clippper but so far so good. I got rid of my Andis clipper because it kept pulling my hair and the power wasn't sufficient. The wahl clipper glides pretty smooth when cutting although it does still tend to pull my at times but that may be due to user error. The trimmer is an added bonus with this set since it is difficult to get around the ears and neck with regular clippers. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase considering the price and what you get. 
I love these waffle weave microfiber washcloths. (I can't bring myself to use even Egyptian cotton anymore.) This cloth is gentle to skin, and wringing this cloth out is gentle to my joints (with arthritis). Each washcloth is packaged in a reusable plastiic zip open/shut bag - it's great for travel, you can pack it up even when it's wet. Another "plus" is that microfiber dries much faster than traditional cotton terrycloth. With the neutral colors of white/linen you can use them with any towels you may have ... until you take the total microfiber plunge, and get the towels too! It's a good way to try microfiber, to see how you like it. (P.S. You will! 
Excellent product, just as advertised and the price was outstanding...far below all retail outlets I checked...even with paying for shipping 
I like it so muchI tracked it down online to buy another one-I originally bought one from Wally world for about 10 bucks, so i was happy to see the price on here was close. In fact I think alot of people know about them cause recently last year my car was broken into and they stole my cd player, AND MY BRAUN TRAVEL SHAVER!!! I was CRUSHED! I filed a report for the cd player but i was outta luck for the shaver--but com on- really- why do you got to steal another mans electric shaver?!?! I'm glad I found it again and I can't wait to get it in the mail--The other best part is that you CAN replace the battery! Unlike alot of cordless trimmers and such that cost pretty pennies to replace or repair-these little shavers ARE Fabulous and I don't mind going down to the dollar store and picking up another pack of batteries and get shaving thanks Braun for a great product-and thanks Amazon for reuniting me with a lost love 
I had an earlier model Braun travel shaver that was mediocre--a little weak in shaving power and it would sometimes turn on from movement in my travel bag. This one has plenty of power, the microscreen allows for a very close shave, plus it has a rotating lock on the switch that prevents it from accidentally turning itself on. In fact, I like this shaver so well that, even though I ordinarily use a blade, sometimes I'll pick it up at home for a quick shave or an evening touch-up before going out. One drawback--while it generally shaves as close as a blade, if I skip a day in shaving and have two days' worth of beard, this shaver has a little trouble cutting--it tends to slide over the matted down hairs somewhat and it takes some work to get them all cut. I think that's characteristic of microscreen shavers 
This is a great stool and I would recommend it for anyone who needs this type of stool. It is small enough to fit in a tub as it was advertized 
I had previously ordered shower stools that were more bench-shaped. But the legs always ended up warping from weight (even though I'm just average sized) and the stools ultimately ended up sagging and becoming uneven. However, after a few months of using this shower stool, I am optimistic that that will not happen due to the better-shaped design. I also like the size much better anyway, since my shower stall is not big. The stool is big enough for me to sit on comfortably, but doesn't take up a lot of space. It was fairly easy to put together. It's sturdy and it hasn't rusted. I am very happy with it. 
i found this stool to be just the right height and size for a tub enclosed shower. It is constructed of top quality material and is very stable [I'm 5ft 8in and 150 lbs] 
This tub stool is exactly what I needed for my small bath tub space!! It is sturdy and functional, yet takes up minimal space. 
This is great for shower stalls! It fits perfectly and is very sturdy. It adjusts easily 
WOrks well - recommend for smaller tub/shower stalls - easy to assembl 
This tub stool arrived today and it took about 15 minutes to assemble it with only a philips screw driver. It is well made and appears to be very sturdy, and the locking system of the leg height adjustment is very secure. It looks better "in the flesh" than in the photos and I am extremely pleased with it. And best of all, the price was right! 
This tub stool is perfect. I have a very small shower and this stool is small enough to fit in and it is comfortable and secure to sit on. I can't find one thing wrong with it 
I sell these in my Day Spa for clients to use at home between waxes and they love them. 
I was a little worried about this one, based on the price, but it's worth it. Yes, an epilator is painful, so if you don't want pain then don't buy one. You won't get completely smooth skin right away, it'll take more than one session over the course of a few weeks, but the hair you remove won't come back as thick or as densely. I recommend using the skin guard if you're doing your underarms, since the skin is more sensitive there 
I had bought this because I was tired of shaving, and too chicken to wax. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually work well. First of all, it hurts. I will admit that my skin is very sensitive, so that may have a lot to do with it. But It hurts unbelievably, especially if you do tender ares such as feet and armpits. I quit using it because of not only the pain, but in the time it takes to do one leg I could have shaved ten times. Its definately not worth the money 
This epilator does its job. It's less painful compared to others because of the Skin Protector cap, but for really short hair you have to take it off otherwise it won't grab the hair. The batery doesn't last long so for large jobs (like legs) you have to keep it plugged, but being cordless really helps for those smaller jobs in odd angles.. 
okay this hurts. once you get started though, you get used to it. it does work and works well. like the fact that you can use it cordless. great little storage bag. wish it was just a tad bit more powerful but it does get the job done. would recommend and would also buy again. 
This trimmer gives a nice even shave and cleans up easily. Wonderful price too 
I've been using it for about 3 years now (though I just purchased a new one after losing it) and it's a really impressive product. It does exactly what it says it does. I think it's especially useful when you also have the remington precision trimmer for the smallest details 
After looking at and reading about various products,I chose to go with this one.And the other reviews were accurate.It's not a shaver,it's a groomer.And,for the price,it does a great job.And the batteries lasted longer than I expected. 
I love this trimmer because it gives you a close enough trim without being too short. Not recommended if you are trying to eliminate the hair, but do recommend if you are trying to eliminate the bulk. : 
I really like this Trimmer - trims nicely and leaves no razor burn on my sensitive skin. Use it on my bikini area, and to trim eyebrows 
I brought this 2 days ago. Really I like this piece. Good one, it helps me in keeping my frech beard clean and maintain good shape. Bottom line, is worth for money spent 
it is perfect trimmer but remember its not shaving razor :) 
This is a fine product for the price. I should have read the info closer to take notice that it is BATTERY ONLY. 
Used this on the longer hair on my bikini area and it worked great. Cuts well and keeps hair evenly trimmed. Batteries didn't last as long as I'd like but would recommend the product anyway. 
It is great for fine hair. Makes hair shiny. The fast heat up is a time saver. The auto shut-off safety feature is a definite plus. 
I don't like to blow dry my hair, nor do I like to walk around with wet hair courting colds. This hot brush is a good alternative. The wide range of temperature is a really good feature. Its good for the price and does all that is advertised, but you have to be careful with the tip - you can still get burnt regardless of the "cool tip" feature. 
Does everything features listed...Auto shut off/turbo heat in less 1 minute !! for best results do not use the hot brush with wet hair, my hair using this brush is shine looks free of static or frizz!! This my personal opinion if you want nice, soft and shine hair do not use hair dryer...i have Black Hair soft and shine but when use Hair dryer looks terrible like lion hair!! Always i use hot brushes take little long time but is better. When i saw this brush with Dual Voltage $9.99 and free shipping!! I bought two and now i ordered one more! 
Never had a pad like this! The digital display makes it so nice. You can set your temp and the timer to auto shut-off, and then drift off to sleep without a worry of leaving it on. It's nice and heavy so it doesn't slide around and I love not having to mess with water! This pad is well worth the price! 
I owned one of these for years and just loved it. When my daughter injured her back I lent it to her and of course didn't see it again so then came the time when I wanted a heating pad and didn't have one. Took a trip to WalMart and purchased the most expensive moist heating pad they had which was around $29.00. What a waste of money (slow, not enough heat, barely any moisture) and it really got me to appreciate how awesome these professional moist heating pads are. The extent to which these pads produce moist (and I do mean moist) heat is amazing and that they do it in a matter of minutes is enough to justify the price alone. Dollar for dollar this large pad is worth its weight in gold. Although it is heavier than those department store pads the weight is a big selling point. It actually helps it feel good on your back because the pad is weighted down it is closer to your skin. It also makes it so the pad is not slipping off or moving around on your back. The flannel cover is substantial high quality material(not thin, rough or cheap fabric) soft and cozy. It is washable as well. The controls are easy to operate. Bottom line is nothing out there compares to these professional pads. Don't waste your time and money on anything else. 
Brushing and flossing my son's teeth is always a challange, but these have made brushing and flossing time SO much better. He loves choosing the dinosaur for each evening. They fit easily between little ones' teeth and don't shred. Can't say enough about them! 
my daughter specifically requested these flossers for her teeth after trying a sample at the dentist. so child friendly it inspires children to floss by themselves! what a great way to start a routine for good oral hygiene 
Any child who has teeth that are close together needs to floss. I don't think I could get standard floss into my child's mouth. Individual flossers are the answer, but some flossers can get stuck between teeth. These dinosaur flossers are the only ones I've found that consistently get between teeth without getting stuck or shredding 
This is a relaxing and easy to use mat. Easy to use and put away. Haven't tried the hookup for music yet, since I don't have an MP3. But the mat on it's own is great 
I used to use a Panasonic shaver. The store went out of business. I found another specialty store for shavers and electronics. I asked the owner what was the best shaver and he recommended the Remington. I bought it and it took 2-3 weeks to adjust to it. It is the BEST shaver I haver ever used. It gives you a close shave. If you don't shave for 2 weeks after using it, your beard will be unbelievably soft. It recharges in less than 1 hour. Armand Auger, M.D., retire 
This is definitely the best shaver I have ever owned. The motor in this shaver is very strong and powerful. I have a tough beard and it shaves as close as a blade, just like the Remington slogan says. Also, the features that come with the shaver are great too. 
This is my first electric shaver. I have pretty rough skin and i get a lot of ingrown hairs. I'm a dark hispanic male and the shaver isn't doing much for me. It isn't as clean of a shave as a regular blade. It does leave your skin smooth but it doesn't cut very deep as to remove all the hair. It has a great desisn and very easy to work with and to travel with but the cut is just not the greatest 
I purchased two packages of this soap in November of 2006 and still have plenty of bars of soap left. I have two teenage boys that are involved in several sports and they shower constantly. They come out of the shower smelling clean and fresh and the soap lasts. You can't ask for more, definitely a good deal and worth every cent 
The shipping took more than 2 weeks to reach me. There was a package damage and got ship back to Amazon but never shipped back to me until I call customer service. Customer service was great though 
I bought it when it is on a huge discount. The soap smells good too 
before i bought this trimmer, i read several reviews for this product and items similar to it. These reviews really highlighted the idea that people who were looking for a trimmer liked the product and people who were looking for a shaver did not. this product is exactly what it claims to be: a good trimmer, small, and pink 
I have gone through quite a few "personal groomers" "beard trimmers" etc etc and a couple of bikini trimmers as well but this product is wonderful. Its compact and non intrusive- the others came with big base holders and room for all sorts of attachments which just made it cumbersome, very light and although i am not a fan of the "girly" products, the pink of this trimmer is so light that it avoids being obnoxious. On top of it all it works GREAT. its a must : 
This item has worked very well for us to keep our 20 month old from opening several doors. However, if you have very thin door handles, you may need to tape some cardboard around the handles to pad them up enough to make sure this snaps back into place. It only took me about 30 minutes to install 6 of these, so I'm not so sure about the other reviewer's comment. We always open these one handed, so that our son doesn't figure out how to open it -- his hands are too small to do it with one hand. If he saw us do it with two, he would probably figure it out! The reviewers who wrote that this won't work with left-handed doors or who think it will lock you out from the other side are clueless. This item can be used with either side door, when installed on the side of an interior door without a lock it can be set up to allow access to the hole for unlocking a locked door, and it does not lock the door from the other side 
This has been good product. Excessive jiggling or improper opening "technique" can loosen adhesive, but have been able to readhere. The snap together lever covers can face right or left...you just have to pop out the circular cover and place it on the reverse side (is designed this way to accommodate just this situation--see instructions) 
This towel is excellent. I wish it came in more colors or even white and I still don't know how to use the snap that is attached but I love the absorbency of the towel. It cuts my hair-drying time in half 
THese are marvelous!! I had gotten a different style last February for mothers,,these adventure towels are great for the dorm and college kids...I love the snap strap and the pouch. Now all of my children want them, too!! Also love the up to date colors! 
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband who suffers from sciatica. He says it brings him such relief that when we go out of town, it's the first thing he grabs.I highly reccomend this product 
Taste's like candy. Occasionally will make you gassy. Will allow you to drop unbelieveable bombs, I never knew I had it in me...WOW 
These are great especially if you are one that does not eat a lot of fiber. No messy powders. Just pop two a day in your mouth and your set! You can't beat the price for two bottles! If you go to the store you will pay a lot more 
I have used this product for years. It is great. It does what it is supposed to do, and has no sugar. Great for people counting carbs. Good way to get 0 carbs and high fiber all at the same time 
Poop like a race Horse with Fiber Choice. These chewable Tablets are great and add plenty of good fiber to your diet. The Sugar Free assorted fruit flavors are great 
I'm a huge fan of these pills. I like good, strong bowel movements, and these pills really let the good times roll. Even if you get enough fiber in your normal diet, I recommend these pills. Like lighting a fuse on a poo firecracker 
Believe it or not, these fiber tablets are actually pretty yummy! Sometimes I eat them just because I crave the taste. Much better than dissolvable ones 
This is just awesome. All the person has to do is press the button to call for help. We used it the first evening. The only drawback is that it's very easy to hit the button accidentally--that's happened 3 times. However, for a small amount of money, you can't afford to let senior family friends be without i 
This is a great travel size. Heats up quickly and is hot enough to curl even straight hair 
I ordered this item an confirmed: it is two packs of 12 batteries each, for a total of 24 batteries. I though the price was good, and the batteries are not bad alkalines ones. 
I have found Rayovac Alkaline Cells Last about 10% longer and have a slighty higher Starting Voltage than Most Akaline Cells 
iam amazed at how easy it is to use the ear thermometer. I was always taught to use an oral thermometer. my children love this better and they do not complain anymore. 
I was invited to a baby shower and it was a big hit! Very reliable and useful 
We really like this thermometer. I know that people say that it's inaccurate, but our pediatrician recommends this thermometer and says that you have to take the temperature a few times and look at the average reading. It's really fast and very easy to see the reading 
I bought this themometer when my oldest was about a year old, that was two years ago. It is SO much easier than taking the temp under the armpit or in the bottom, and a WHOLE lot faster. I have not had problems with inaccurate readings. As others have written, you just need to get it in the ear canal right. It is a little harder on our infant b/c she's smaller, but it still works. You can't beat the price either. Finding probe covers is a bit of a challenge though 
I am a nurse and know how to use this thermometer and it is very inaccurate. I have taken my childrens temperature and it is consistantly in the 100's and they are not even sick. Do not waste your money. 
I love this thermometer! I actually bought my first one two years ago from Children's Hospital recomendation. My son had been very sick and all three hospital's we had to go to used this one. Any inaccurate reading is either usuer error or narrow canals. I only have to get a new one because it got lost in the move. 
I have been very pleased with the mask. The mask itself is very soft and gentle to my face. The mask has helped relieve some sinus pain and migraine pain also. It was very relaxing and soothing. I highly recommend this product 
My 2 year old son is a heavy wetter. After turning 2 he must have started urinating more at night, because he started leaking out of his diaper every single night. We used all different brands, including luvs and huggies regular ones. We went to size 6 even though size 5 still fit. (He is slim). Well... still leaking. I decided to get the Huggies nighttime diapers, but Amazon didn't have them anymore and I couldn't find them in our small town. After reading another review, I decided to try the supreme diapers, and they worked like a charm! He has only leaked out of these maybe 2 times, and it has been about 6 months. So I highly recommend. I love the fit and elastic band on them. The exterior is so durable too. I can let him run around in these without shorts and they don't shred like other brands do. 
I have used this style diaper for my 3 children and love it. The kids sometimes go 14 hours in a wet diaper without leakage or a rash. It is worth the extra money 
Thus far, these have been the best diapers for my child. The weight reccommendations have been the most accurate, and I have had almost no problems with leaking. I like these better than the baby shaped ones only because they are softer. I have choosen Huggies over pampers b/c of leakage and I have had to move my child up in size long b/f she reaches the pound limits in Pampers (generally 3 lbs b/f she reaches the max). I do have to fold them over a bit b/c they seem to be a little long for my daughter, but other than that I have no complaints. 
I am very happy with the diapers deal that I got. If you ordered $99 worth you got $30 free and free shipping. I only wish they had more of a selection in sizes I ordered the next size so they would come immediatley instead of a month later 
We have been using these Gentle care diapers ever since my son is born and he is 2 months now. There have been no rashes or signs of fussiness due to diaper. I give full 5 stars to this product 
I have 3 kids. One is ten one is seven and a 7 week old. I have used nothing but Huggies since they were born and all through their diaper days. I love them because they dont leak and they are really absorbent. I have never liked pampers, I have even given them second chances but always come back to buying huggies. They fit great and are worth the money 
My son fits into these diapers very nicely. He is a big boy, was 11 lbs when he was born. Have had a hard time finding diapers that fit, and still hold without leaking. These are very nice, they fit perfect, they don't sag, or fall off. They cost a little more than Pampers, but worth the money. 
What more can I say? They're comfortable and absorbent. No leaks for little girls. The elastic stretch is great and these diapers do not tear easily. The extra padding is a big plus, and worth the teeny bit extra price. Amazon.com's super saver shipping is the reason I get these online. Why would you go anywhere else? 1800 diapers can NOT beat this deal 
I had been using this lotion warmer/dispenser for about six months when it broke. The heating element still works, but the pump no longer produces lotion when pushed, rendering it useless. Also, before it was broken, it was necessary to fill the well nearly full in order to get any lotion out, which meant refilling it nearly every week. I don't recommend it 
I am a massage therapist and use Biotone Herbal Select Body Therapy Massage Creme exclusively. In Alaska, in the winter, using this creme during a session without the Conair Heated Lotion Dispenser would be impossible. I have used this dispenser so much all the identifying brand marks have worn off and I and ordering a back up right now 
As a massage therapist, I think it's a great item. It's large, so I don't have to keep refilling it, and my clients just love it when the lotion comes on warm! It's just terrible to feel instant cold on a bare back! Very nice for professional use, but other than that... Very durable, can withstand constant use and doesn't clog often 
This is such a great invention. I always hated putting cold lotion on. Not anymore. Turn it on and in seconds it warm. Awesome 
We have 4 of the JUICE D's in an elliptical that gets daily use. They hold their charge very well. I would recommend the JUICE recharger as well. With this combination, I have to recharge once every 1-2 months. very satisfied!! 
This is a pretty good flavor. It isn't my all time favorite (Apricot) but way up there 
If your looking for a bar that hits the spot without leaving you wanting more this is the bar for you provides great flavor and satisfies I highly recommend this bar for in between snacks not to high in fat has more carbs than other protein bars but is a great overall ba 
For once, I don't have to do a "public service" by going to clifbar.com and looking up the ingredients and nutritional information; Amazon.com has it all at the top of the product page. Now, I can focus on taste! That's a good thing, because this (along with the Clif Z-Bar, chocolate) is one of the better tasting "nutritional" snacks of its kind. It has just enough chocolate (brought to you by chocolate chips (which include organic cane juice, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa butter, and unspecified "natural flavors") to actually impart a chocolate flavor. Not a heavy or rich chocolate flavor, but an unmistakable one: You don't have to close your eyes, and convince yourself that it's chocolate. (Ever notice how permeable artificial flavors can be? Let's say you're eating a Popsicle--excuse me--a frozen fruit treat. You close your eyes, and the flavor clues are all but gone. Think purple, and its tastes like grape; think orange, and it's orange, think light blue and it's bubble gum--if you know the code, that is.) This is like a giant Bit-O-Honey candy, it has that chewy texture over laden with honey, with some sticky peanut butter and chocolate thrown in, and you've pretty much captured the flavor. To my surprise, there is no honey, that taste derives somehow from the syrups, malt, cane juice, fig paste, and other sweet ingredients. It's definitely filling, especially if accompanied by an apple or something, and at least eight ounces of water. It's very chewy, yet it doesn't seem as dry as similar products. Could it be the six grams of fat-two of which are saturated? Yes, two grams of saturated fat! NOT good. I'll try to balance that with the fact that it's made from 70% organic ingredients, has a whopping 11 grams of protein, only 20 grams of sugar (compare that with other brands and flavors), and includes five grams of fiber. Along with Clif's Z-bar and the excellent Clif apple raisin walnut, this is one of the better tasting of its kind--just don't expect a brownie 
I received the product quickly, it was in great shape, and I will buy more as soon as I eat all these up 
Clif Bars are amoung the best tasting energy bars I have ever tried. They may not pack as many calories or grams of protein as other brands, but there have been times where I could not even finish a competeing bar because of dismal taste or texture 
The best sports bar around. Great taste, organic, contains plenty of Antioxidants, and contains a good amount of protein. The only down side is the high amount of carbs, especially the sugars, but I still give it five stars 
Clif Bars have been part of my families life for a long time and provides a good quick meal or snack depending on your activity level. Definitely recommend having water available 
I've tried many types of nutrition bars and many are too sweet or they are not tasty. Clif bars get it right 
This has great moisturizers and works on the hands just as well as the feet 
I had rough dry heels from all the sandles and flip flops I've been wearing so far this Summer and this showed improvement in just one nights use. I used it and then wore socks to bed. The next morning my feet were so soft and moisturized. I use it everyday and each day my feet look and feel better and better! I think this product is great and would suggest it to anyone who has rough, dry, or cracked feet 
My husband bought this for his cracked, dry feet. I started using it last summer when I wore a lot of sandles and the bottoms of my feet started to look and feel dry. I love it! The first few days I used it, I lathered it on thick put on a pair of socks went to bed. The first morning I noticed a difference and after 3 nights - wow! No more dry feet! It works well for my husband too! Now I just spot use it, whenever the heels or balls of my feet start to feel dry. It is a bit thin-the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars, but still works great! 1smileycat :- 
I thought this was a real nice lotion...thick and smelled wonderful!! It has a citrus smell. The cream itself worked well and wasn't greasy feeling!! This is an item I'd purchase. I enjoyed it 
It had a nice scent, wasn't greasy feeling, and worked very nicely! Also, I work part-time in a deli and am forever washing my hands at work. They're exposed to bleach and sanitizers, and I've been using it to help soften up my hands too. It's worked nicely 
I liked this product very much. It's a very rich cream, and it moisturizes very well. It has a tingling sensation that relieves the fatigue of the day from your feet. I also tried some on my elbows and was very satisfied with the results 
I use this shampoo on a daily basis. It does not dry out my hair, but softens and gently cleans. I enjoy the smell, which is not filled with alot of perfume. Has a very earthy smell. 
This shampoo is great. I love how silky it makes my hair and reduces the frizz 
I had my first Wahl "massager" for almost 15 years before the cord frayed. It is such a great and reliable product and the two-speed function allows you to control the intensity. I also appreciate the various attachments which allow you to pinpoint just the area you want to work on. May I risk saying I find this a multi-purpose massager and have found many marvelous uses. For the money, you can't get anything better 
I had a massagers wahl for 15 years with speeds too, when the wire became frade I had a hard time finding another wahl until I again checked the Amazon and was so happy to see the name (Wahl) again. Conair was all I could find, good, but not the power of Wahl 
I must say I was very skeptical when I received this massager as a gift. It looked a little clunky and is pretty heavy. However, once I turned it on and gave it a try I was pleasantly suprised. It has a really nice vibration speed and motion that is a little different compared to most massagers. Also, the rythm really is relaxing for the whole body, not just the area you have the massager directly on. I would recommend this product but wish they made it a little lighter. The wieght of it is a little cumbersome and could be a little too much for smaller individuals 
The Tweezerman tweezers are easily the best I've ever used. Compared to Revlon and other cheapies, which sometimes just don't grip well (a problem when going for those little brow hairs), these make the job a breeze. But I do keep misplacing them...? 
This suits me perfectly. Especially since I shave only once a week. It helps in reducing the number of times I have to use the razor every time I shave. It also increases the life of the razor... :) Only drawback being the working voltage. Where I come from 110VAC is non existent. Maybe they should try other alternative convertion methods. This is why 4 stars only 
I've had this for a couple of months now and "0" problems. All attachments work well and the self sharpening feature reall does work 
I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the "perfect" trimmer, bought this on impulse since the price was right. Best trimmer I have ever used; liked it so much, bought 3 more as spares. The accessories provided cover any kind of facial hair style imaginable, very easy to clean and compact enough to travel with. Highly recommend this trimmer 
I received my first Phillips Light Touch #1 Oval Cushion Brush in 1980. I used is for 7 years and replaced it with the same brush. Through the years, various other brushes were purchased when I would forget my Phillips or something, but NEVER have I found one that I loved more. I now on my third Phillips in 26 years! This brush does not tear your hair. I have had extremely long hair (past my waist) and short hair (shoulder length) through the years and have been happy with it for whatever style I was in at the time. The Phillips gently guides through hair without tangling, tearing or breaking. If there was ever a hairbrush to be excited about...this one is it 
Have been using this brush for almost 15 years. I wish they were easier to find but at least I can order them online. They don't pull your hair and feel so good on the scalp. It's the only brush my daughter and I will use. Once you get one you'll never use another brush 
My hairdresser used a Phillips Light Touch-1. I liked the way it felt, so I bought one from her. That was in 1984. It is the only hairbrush I use other than a small round one for styling. It feels good to the scalp and it untangles your hair without pulling. I love it. 
I too, have used these for over 10 years. I have many other expensive salon brushes gathering dust. Save for one huge, round boar bristle, this is the only brush my daughter and I need for our long hair. These brushes are great for flattening out as it grabs the hair without tangling. The give in the bristle is not too hard, and not too loose. The ergonomics are right on as well. My husband and sons also use these brushes exclusively. It also works well after the shower for the boys on their thick, wet, curly locks. We have the #2 small sizes for the cars, backpacks and travel. 
I have used this style of brush for over 12 years now. It's the only one my girls and I like. We all have long, thick hair! Very comfortable..doesn't pull the hair at the scalp. They used to carry it at Sally Beauty Supply..then they discontinued it! 
This product replaced an old mechanical scale that seemed to vary in indicated weight with the weather. (or perhaps the barometric reading?) My wife weighed on Doctor's scales, came home and weighed, and the two weights were identical, so she is pleased and confident in the accuracy of the Tanita. We have yet to make good use of the body fat feature, as we could tell from other reviews that consistency in time and conditions would be very important 
I bought this scale about a week ago and have found it to be the most accurate scale I've ever had. It's consistent with the one at work I use, which is the weight balance type. I've found the body fat measurement to be very consistent. Tanita recommends monitoring yourself at a consistent time (a few hours after eating in the evening). I'm consistent by .5%. If I try it any other type, it's the same. Not much variation. However, I am a bit skeptical about results. Both my wife and I are fairly lean folks (the lucky gene). I fall under the normal range (15%). However, she consistently registers at a very low percentage rate (at 7%) - which neither she nor I believe 
I love this scale. It is easy to use and keep track of your weight. It feels study when you step on it and I like that. I don't like to step on a scale and feel like I am going to break it! 
Excellent scale- ever since I bought it, I've been losing weight since I can accurately tell how much I weigh. It's a MUST for weight loss. I weighed 176 the day I got it, I'm at 157 right now. As for the water percentage, it's worthless- as long as you're over 50% (for a male), your fine. It's related to the body fat %. The body fat % fluctuates too much to be that great. It's a good rough estimate- but I go from 16-19% depending on when I weigh myself. I find that I'm 16% when I follow the recommended advice (don't eat for 2 hours and then weight yourself), but that's definitely too low in my opinion. I still got a small beer belly. 19% seems more accurate and I get that after I eat. But the body fat percentage has definitely gone down since I lost weight, so like I said -it's a good estimate, but don't worry about 3% fluctuations. I think the key with this scale is to note your lowest weight (in the morning when you get up, just do the weigh only option). That way if that weight goes down, you know you lost weight! And it's amazing how many pounds you gain right after your eat (clothes weight about 2-5 pounds depending on jeans/pajamas,etc. 
I have owned lots of scales over the years and I have never had good luck so I was sceptical since I have never had an accurate one. But this one I have checked it's accuracy getting home from doctors appoinments and checking my weight against this scale and it's identical to the doctors office! Easy to weigh little kids on too. Super easy to set up and use. Also, looks great in the bathroom. 
I have had no prblems with this product. It works well and the price was right 
I really think this is one of the best smells that exist nowdays. Perfect parfume for men. One of my friends told that when he use this parfume his girlfriend become "whorny". Really don't know about that, but it proves that women like this smell on her men. Think this is amazing smell as for business suite, the same for everyday use. Highly recommended!! 
This is a great product as long as you are sleeping on your back. I love it for napping in the chair or in the car. I really like the sounds, but be aware it doesn't block out other noise (great for me as I want to be able to hear my kids). Unfortunately, I am a side sleeper and the battery and sound unit create uncomfortable pressure on my temples. And since the battery unit is one side and the sound unit is on the other, I am uncomfortable on either side - sometimes ending up with a headache. But it you are a back sleeper or want it for naps in the recliner or for travel, THIS IS A FIRST CLASS PRODUCT 
I work third shift so my bedroom is pretty light at 7a.m. when i get home. I have always used some sort of eye mask but this is the best one ever. The music is great as it is. Love it and dont intend to be without it--(at least until retirement in two years! Ha 
i don't know if anyone else has this problem, but the velour makes my eyebrows itch! i like the countryside track...it's the most peaceful one to me 
This sleep mask is great if you are a back sleeper. The battery pack is uncomfortable to sleep on if you are a side sleeper. Since I am a side sleeper, I had to purchase a regular sleep mask without sound. I am keeping this mask as well, to use for traveling. When I first tried to turn the sleep mask on, it wouldn't work. There is an on/off switch on the battery pack. The instructions don't tell you that. I am satisfied with the product. If you are a back sleeper, it is very comfortable or if you travel alot, it would be great. I recommend this product. 
Well I must say that this product is truly a great buy. Every time I have used it, I have no complaints. I really liked that I could use my CD player with it. I have this awesome set of CD's consisting of piano music with the ocean in the background and using the mask as a headset allows me to listen to therapeutic sounds continuously. I let my folks try it out and they bought one yesterday. My husband has one without the audio hook up and I know he is jealous, just won't admit! 
You obviuously got a defective one, return it! What's the point of writing a review and telling everyone that the sounds on ONE defective mask don't work? Not a very helpful review at all! I definately am ordering on now, I plan on getting it not only for the feature of the nature souds, but so that I can plug in a jack and listen to the radio or a cd and not bother my husband. Plus I use a sleep mask now, so this will acomplish 2 things at once 
I ordered this item for my migraines and insomnia...I was really excited when I got it!! Well, guess what? The 'white noise' sounds advertised do not play....I tried a couple sets of batteries. This is not a great product-I will give it this though, it is comfy and blocks out all light. I guess I can give it one star for that 
I have used Eternity since I was a teenager (15 years of Eternity!!) and I have never received so many compliments. This perfume is nothing but light, airy, and elegant. No cheap perfume smell here. You will not blow poeple away with this, but you will definitely make an impression. My best friend, who happens to be a male, says that whenever he takes me out in his car, I leave my "essence" behind. He says this with a big smile. He says that the smell makes him feel like he's gotten a "big hug". 
I am very happy to have found this item. I suffer from a herniated disc in my lower back, and this has made it possible for me to sit much more comfortably in both my car and in front of my computer! Highly recommended 
The cartridge costs about $5 and last only 20 days before the filter and the cartridge starting reek. However, I found that Holmes Bacteriastat cost about $7 and could last for a season and it also extended the life of the filter. My suggestion is to buy the Bacteriastat. 
This is a must have if you have one of those humidifier I have and also for people like me. The lazy kind of people. I find the money I spend on this vs. the amount of time I have to do to clean the humidifier is well worth it. 
this product aids in the over all performance of our humidifier and adds to the filters life cycle 
I think this cleaning cartridge really helps keep the humidifier base free of mineral deposits and mold. I've had my humidifier for a month and so far no buildup. Also, the filter is still pretty clean. 
BUT IT DOES! We bought a Honeywell humidifier and it came with a free cartridge. We tossed it in and forgot about it. A month and a half later, my husband decided to change the filter and, as the thirty day life of the cartridge had expired, he tossed it. We could not find a replacement in a local store, so we just didn't worry about getting another one. Two weeks later the humidifier started smelling toxic. We removed the cover and filter to find slime everywhere! After only two weeks! These little cartridges are definitely good investments, given the cost of filters these days 
So much easier to keep your humidifier clean.. It really seems to limit mold buildup. I would have rated it 5 stars if it lasted longer than 30 days 
I have an evaporizing humidifier. I dropped one of these in the tank and my filter was good for almost a month. The indicator barely moved. I removed the cartridge from the tank and intended on getting a new one from the store. I put it off and forgot and my filter was bad by the end of the week. My new filter only lasted 2 weeks without the cartridge. This cartridge extended my filter life by almost double. Probably would have been longer if I had replaced the cartridge sooner. $30.00 later replacing my filter AGAIN I'm buying more of these. They definitely help 
These cartridges really do help keep down growth in the tank. I wouldn't run my daughter's humidifier without them anymore. People shouldn't assume, however, that they replace regular cleaning of the humidifier. I think they're a great adjunct to routine humidifier care. 
We love the downpour but the plastic holder keeps breaking. Purchased three already and the shower holder cracked again. If the holder was metal I would buy again 
Had the same experience an earlier reviewer had... the thing leaked like crazy after installation. The washer didn't want to stay in place and the two pieces didn't thread together snugly. Had to use plumber's tape to get it to stop leaking, and even then it was touchy. The worst was yet to come -- couldn't get the darn thing to hold itself upright. It's very top heavy (the head is about the size/diameter of a small pizza) and the plastic components just don't support it. It flops forward no matter what we do. That's fine for me, I'm short. For my tall husband, it's a nightmare. After about two weeks of use, the plastic piece that holds the showerhead cracked. I have to rubber band it together to keep it functioning, which prevents me from using it as a handheld. Today, I'm sporting a fat lip because the thing popped out of it's jerry-rigged holder and smacked me. Needless to say, I'm ordering something else today. It is such an inferior product I will probably never buy another WaterPik item -- suspecting they have abandoned any quality-assurance standards 
I bought this because it was a good compromise; my husband wanted a rain-shower head, and I wanted the hand-held option. After fining tuning the intallation with teflon tape to stop the massive leak that occurred with installation, this shower head worked like a charm. However, we have now owned the shower head for 9 months and it is falling apart. It is cracked on the side and we receive almost no water pressure from the head. It is made of plastic and is pulling apart. We have had to tape the handle together to receive any water out of the head. There is a reason this is such a great price - my advice would be to invest a little more and you will not be shopping for a new shower head in 9 months 
I'm extremely happy with the waterpik. I bought the hand-held and I think it works great! Just what I was looking for 
I purchased this showerhead after buying a much cheaper one that left a lot to be desired! A friend had the white version of this showerhead, and it seemed like a good fit for my shower. I bought the chrome version because I thought it would hold up better than the white one. I really like the showerhead! It is heavier than the bad showerhead I had before, but it works so much better! It is completely adjustable and stays in place without having to use any tools. I suppose that it would be tighter if I used tools; however, the package doesn't recommend it. Overall, I think this is worth buying 
In response to "L. McKeever's" lousy feedback on this wonderful item I thought I would leave a valuable hint to getting his showerhead to mount properly....even though the directions say "DON'T USE TOOLS" use a pair of vice grips (CAREFULLY SO AS NOT TO MAR THE SURFACES)....it's the only way to get fittings tight and showerhead mounted straight and tall. I noticed all 6 of "L. McKeever's" other reviews were negative too--rather than working on a solution he just leaves negative feedback. This is harmful to products being sold and it's not fair to this wonderful product! LOVE the JET STREAM setting!!! Get your vice grips ready and buy this great showerhead with confidence! 
I purchased this shower head on my wifes wanting one of the shower heads with the large downpour settings. I've grown fond of it myself. The power spray works well for rinsing hair products out of hair. The downpour setting gives a gentle rainshower effect that's very relaxing and works very well for rinsing soap from the body. If you have lower water pressure, as we do at our house, you'll want to look at the directions at the Water Pik site to remove the 2.5 gallon restricter. It will greatly increase pressure, especially on power rinse. It is important that the swivel point connection get tightened sufficient or the head assembly will not stay up. We've had no problem once it was tightened and it's stayed fine for several weeks. 
I used the Jerdon Pedismooth Pedicure set when it first arrived. I liked it, however, I wish it had a little more power to it. Make sure you soak your feet first. Overall I would say I was a good buy 
I bought this for my husband because his feet are very rough on the bottom. I specifically ordered this one since the head was bigger than the other ones I found on line. I tried it on myself first. It has NO power to it at all and if you put any pressure on it, it will come to a stop. After a few seconds with it on, it started to smell of burnt plastic. 
This is a great addition to a self pedicure. I have purchased a total of 5 units. They make great gifts 
tHIS IS A GREAT ITEM. I USED IT ALL OF THE SUMMER BECAUSE I WEAR SANDALS AND WELL MY SKIN WAS GETTING ROUGH BUT AFTER BUYING THIS I HAVE ONCE AGAIN MY SOFT FEET. 
I have been using this product for just 5 days and it has transformed my feet from dry to soft. It's like getting a salon treatment at home.... I would definitely recommend the Jerdon Pedicure set 
Whaow! I bought this product based on reviews on Amazon. No other site had reviews about this product and I was skeptical about buying it. But what a surprise! Its an awesome piece of work. I used it with just 2 batteries on the level 1 and it worked so good. I cleaned my rugged heels in exactly 10 minutes. Quick tip: Like normal pedicure, soak your feet in warm water with liquid soap / shampoo for 5-7 minutes, dry them and then use the machine. I am so thrilled with this Jerdon Pedismooth that now I am gonna use the Jerdon Manicure kit too. I got that also on Amazon. I am sure it will be as great. Kiss roughness goodbye 
This pedicure set is great! I gave it to someone for a gift, and it was a big, big hit! Now the person I gave it to is buying some for others. I don't know how long it might last -- only had it about 3 months so far, but it seems fairly sturdy and it does a great job. Plus, at under $10, it would totally be worth it even if it didn't last forever. One thing, the attachments that work the best are the little sand paper-like pieces, and you should go ahead and order some extras of these while you're at it 
I was sceptical that the monitor would not be accurate enough or would be difficult to use but it rocks! Many different people (of all shapes and sizes) have tried it with great success. It is a safe buy 
I've searched for a while now, and have to say this is the best one I've found. It is very slim, easy to use and very portable! It comes with a case that easily slims into your purse or bag. It does have memory storage to keep tract of past readings which is handy when you need to keep track and don't have paper handy! The display is pleasing to the eye, easy to read and even has a color light confirmation as well. As for accuracy, so far it has been right on target. I have natrually low blood pressure and every time I check, its right where it should be. This is a great device for anyone who needs a portable machine. Its slim, simple to use and read, and accurate. I highly recommend it. 
The monitor looks really nice, small and stylish, that is probably it. It is probably the worst monitor we have tried. Yes, we read all of the instructions and did the measurement exactly as suggested. The worst part is that you can measure it five times and you would get five totaly different numbers. We returned it and bought a Omron cuff based monitor 
This smells so good, I was happy with the size of the bottle 
These are some of the very best tasting energy bars I've ever had, and they have some of the very best ingredients I've come across so far. I find the chocolate coated bars to be tastier than the natural (because I love chocolate); however, the natural bars are really quite good, too. These bars are soft, easy to chew, have a nice texture, and the chocolate coating is great. Here is a list of all the ingredients for the chocolate bars: Organic medjool dates, organic almond butter, organic quinoa sprout powder, non-gmo soy protein isolate, original GREENS+® powder (non-gmo soy lecithin, organic Hawaiian spirulina, organic apple fiber, barley grass powder, wheat grass powder, Japanese chlorella, hydroponic soy sprouts, organic brown rice bran, sprouted barley malt, alfalfa grass powder, dairy-free probiotics, royal jelly, Montana bee pollen, acerola berry juice, natural vitamin E, licorice root powder, milk thistle extract, echinacea root extract, Siberian Eleuthero root extract, astragalus root extract, licorice root extract, organic red beet juice, dunaliella salina algae, organic Nova Scotia Dulse, organic ginkgo biloba leaf extract, organic Japanese green tea extract, grape seed and skin extract, organic Swedish bilberry extract), organic rice crisps, wildflower honey, mixed tocopherols (natural vitamin E). Chocolate Coating Ingredients: Cocoa butter, barley malt sweetened chocolate, cocoa bean extract. I HIGHLY recommend these bars!!! 
I bought 2 of these at the store 3 years ago and was so excited to find them here on Amazon so I bought 2 more. The previous ones lastd about a year with daily use, but the two I purchase on Amazon burned out within a month. The first one only lasted a week. Maybe a bad batch? I dont know but I don't think I will take a chance again. I am lucky to have kept an old one and have pieced together a working model. Beware! I'm out $40. Don't let this happen to you! 
I love the size, the way it curls my shoulder-length hair and makes it shine. The price is right even though they only last about a year before overheating. It is so worth it, I've been buying them two at a time. I hope they never discontinue this model. 
I love this hair dryer. I have frizzy hair and the ionizer completely takes the frizz away. My hair is short so it not only dries the hair but styles it as well all at once. I have read comments about problems with these dryers. I have not had any problems at all. They do wear out--after almost daily use for 2 years. And for the price, that is really a good value for me. I am buying 2 today--I for now and 1 for a spare down the road in case they stop making this model. Maybe I should buy even more. I love it 
The Vidal Sassoon hot air brush is the best air brush I have ever tried. It got my frizzy processed african-american hair silky straight quickly and without stripping my hair of all its moisture. It also curls the hair very well and gives lasting body and bounce. In order for me to get the results I desired, a bit of tugging was involved to pull the hair straight while the hot air quickly set the hair. The reason I can't give this product 5 stars is becuase it has poor construction. The plastic attachment base of the brush broke after a year of use. Over the years, I have purchased other brands of hot air brushes only to find that I would never be able to match the results achieved with the Vidal Sassoon version. 
This is a great product that many don't even know about. And if they hear about it, they are way too quick to assume it is not important enough. They can also get turned off too quickly by the cost which actually is only about the cost of a dental appointment for crying out loud. This is worth the investment and can save us from doctor visits and missed work. There are some drawbacks as well. One difficulty is not knowing for how long the product is effective. One year, two, three, more? It kills a high percentage of bacteria and viruses on toothbrushes but for how long? How do we know if the product becomes less effective over time for some reason? The product is made in China, which gives me some concern over quality as well as concern about our trade debt and our economy. The correspondence department didn't do well at answering such concerns. The small basket is delicate and one of them broke on me before I had a good idea of how delicate it was. The toothbrushes, at least when placed handle down, have a hot handle after sanitization and there's no warning of this on the Germ Terminator. In spite of the drawbacks, I feel that this product should be far more commonplace. I am unaware of any other product sold that I would consider this good at toothbrush sanitizing. It uses a natural process of heat and steam and is a great storage unit. Use it on newly purchased toothbrushes too. You don't know where they have been 
I have had my Germ Terminator for 2 years and I can't imagin life without it. I am in the health care field and know the importance of preventing microbial contamination whenever possible. Even though it is not considered portable, I travel a great deal and never leave home without it tucked away in my suitcase. It does require a small effort to clean, but small is the operative word. Anyone who cares about keeping themselves and their families healthy would do well to keep a Germ Terminator in every bathroom. Also, you can sterilize other items that will fit in the basket and are not harmed by steam. I routinely sterilize the end of my Water Pik and other assorted dental hygine items before each use. Also, pierced earring that are all metal. I find it indispensable. 
This is a product that must stay on all the time for daily use, so I am glad that I spent the extra money for a professional model with a "smart" thermostat. My wife has arthritis and it's worth it to see the smile on her face after she immerses her hands in the paraffin. It's a great relief to her 
These bars are not as bad as other protein bars that I have tasted. The granola is flavorful and not masked by the soy protein infusion - I recommend these bars as a snack in between meals, they hold me over while out on patrol and/or convoys (I'm in Iraq for awhile) and the guys in my unit also like the bars. The bad thing is delivery - Amazon does not deliver these to APO/FPO addresses, even though the boxes are located in the continental U.S. - I have to have these shipped to my wife, who in turn re-packages them and sends them on to me. It adds a few weeks to the process. 
Some of the other bars, like the BerriesGoMega, Superfood, Strawberry Pomegranate and Chocowalla are more tasty, but this one is packed with protein. I felt compelled to write this review because this bar is not as bad as the other reviewer suggests. The fact is, it's hard to pack a lot of protein into a bar and keep it tasting great. Odwalla does a pretty good job. I would suggest also having something else around to eat, though, as two of these boxes would be a lot to eat without getting sick of these bars. I got through one over a few weeks, no problem, and I'm not totally sick of the bars 
This is a beauty. It has the look and feel of a first class writing instrument. It can be changed to accommodate your own writing style with a felt tip, rolling ball, or a standard ball point (not sure about the ball point, but then why would anyone choose to write with a ball point pen?). Highly recommended. I have owned other so called quality pens but this is the best buy for my money 
I use it for the heartbeat sound. My daughter has one of a different brand and I needed one for my son. It is hard to find one in the stores that has the heartbeat sound and doesn't cost more than $30. This one works as discribed and I have had no problems. I like the volume control better than my daughters. I also like the heartbeat sound better too 
My granddaughter has had trouble getting to sleep. This machine helps her get to sleep and stay asleep. She loves the ocean waves sound 
I bought this for my newborn's room and it has been great. She falls asleep listening to the ocean everyday. My husband and I can hear it from our room as well and we love the calming noise as well. This is a great product and a must have for every nursery 
I bought two- one for me when I travel (to drown out my husband's snoring) and another for my baby. It drowns out all of the startling noise! 
This is a great value! I bought this on a whim for my hubby, who has tinnitus. He would run a tabletop fan pointed at the bed at night so that the noise would drown out the ringing in his ears. Brrrr! Now, he uses this machine on the white noise setting, and we both sleep so much better. If only I can find one of these that will drown out his snoring! ;- 
I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, who kept complaining that he couldn't get to sleep sometimes because the house was too quiet. I looked at a much more expensive sound therapy machine at the mall, but it didn't have white noise, which is what he said he wanted. I thought this one was awfully cheap, but figured I'd try it before investing in a more expensive one. We tried it the first night, and we weren't happy with the white noise sound, but love the falling rain and the running stream. A few days later, I ended up stealing it from his side of the bed and putting it on mine, and I love the thing! Within 5 minutes, I am sound asleep. I love the volume control too, which some machines don't have. I'm probably going to buy one for everyone I know for Xmas next year - I'm that happy with it! Great value for the price too. Goes to show you don't always have to spend more to get a great product 
This is the exact product I was looking for. Many of the "sound machines" out there are very pricey. I just wanted a little white noise in the background for my children while they sleep. (like a fan without the wind) At this price, it was a no brainer. I am happy with this purchase 
My brother sent some of these multi vitamines to my grand parents in India. They saw the results quite quickly. She felt light and her body aches went away. Since then I started sending them :- 
I have been taking Nature made essential over fifty for ten years now,and have loved them.They are everything a women needs in a vitamin 
I found "Nature Made Multi Vitamins/Mineral Tablets, No Iron" for woman 50 and older, to be an essential part of my day. I am not an expert on vitamins, but I have been taking these for quite some time now, and I can tell you from my own experience that they work great for me. I know this because of how I feel on the days I MISS taking them. If I miss just a couple of days, I am more tired then usual, sometimes to the point of needing a nap. Taking them daily, leaves me energetic and feeling good. The buying information on this page, will tell you all the supplement facts: type and amount of vitamin or mineral per tablet and the daily value percentage per each.If I listed them all here, I would probably go over my allotted word count.I'll just say they do include key vitamins and minerals for the over 50 woman, where we just need that little extra boost.According to the box these vitamins and minerals will help: Calcium for healthy bones, Vit C to keep you healthy, Vit E for Heart health and Lutein for maintaining good eye health, among the many other nutritional ingredients. I take these along with an extra C vitamin and and Iron supplement of 65 mg Ferrous Sulfate,and that combination works great for me.There are 90 tablets to a box,so this 3 box-pack is a 9 month supply. What a great deal! The price here at this time(just over 20 dol.) is excellent compared to the price of my neighborhood market. An excellent supplement to your daily healthy eating ritual. These vitamins, would be the first thing I would pack, if I was going on a trip. Remember to breathe, eat healthy, exercise and enjoy....Lauri 
This cost almost twice as much at the major department stores. Great bargain 
It is my favorite perfume. Until this moment, I have thrown five empty bottles and I am ordering two more in the way. Although it is toilette spray, it is fragrance stay for along time 
everybody tells me it smell great. i personally think is one of my favorite 
to me, this is one of the best fragrances i have ever owned BUT it wears off quickly. wears more like edt rather than edp... but i would definately recommend it for the price alone. 
I bought this based on the description and was not dissappointed! It smells great!! It is light and not overpowering. It is impressive looking as well. I am very pleased with this product 
Shi is a wonderful fragrance--light and fresh, but substantial-smelling at the same time. And it lasts for a nice while. Great shopping experience here on Amazon--my order got here quickly, and I could not be more pleased 
I love my perfume, it came in the mail right on time, there were no problems what so ever 
This fragrance makes people ask you, what is that fragrance you're wearing? I had never heard of it before, but now it's my favorite. Great job offering great prices on extraordinary products 
The smell is very relaxing and very elegant. Thanks Amazon 
This is great for daytime use. This clean, clear, lightly floral perfume always bring me good moods in busy days. A black wood seat came with this perfume and it enhanced the simple water drop bottle design. This price is also a great bargain! 
I thought it was a great daytime fragrance, since it's light with just a hint of grapefruit mixed in. Quickly became my number 1 choice for the office 
I use Chanel Allure, DKNY Be Delicious, Michael Kors Michael regularly and Shi is fast becming my regular scent too. I needed a fragrance that worked well for day wear and would not over-power people around me yet stayed on all day. Shi fitted in perfectly - it's floral with musky undertones, very soft and feminine but strong enough to work for me. On me it lingers all day. Just to give you an idea of similar "blue" fragrances - I like Light Blue too which was great for day wear but it was too light for me, and I was tired of Davidoff's Cool water after 3-4 years of day time usage. Shi works perfectly for me 
Shi, the fragrance by noted designer Alfred Sung, is reminiscent of his total design philosophy which is classically modern, whether it be clothing, watches or small leather goods. This fragrance is subtle, fresh with a blend of Water Lily and Fig Leaves. Complementing the initial impression is a composition of Orange Blossom and Frangipani, resulting in a soft feminine scent. As one would expect the packaging, both bottle and box, is elegant simplicity. Utilizing three of nature's elements, wood, water, and metal, Sung has created a beautiful design. The bottle, a perfectly rounded glass rests on a dark wood base. On top of the cap is the Chinese symbol for water. Viewed as a whole, the bottle reminds one of a perfect drop of water. The box is a pale blue with the Chinese water symbol on the top panel. This fragrance would certainly be appropriate for day or evening. - Gail Cook 
After powerwashing windows on the house . . . I got creative and used this just as an experiment. IT WORKED GREAT! 
This product did an excellent job on my Lexus. I've tried to keep the car clean with regular car soap but it wouldn't come show room clean until I used the Mr Clean AutoDry Kit. The soap does a terrifc job on the wheels as well. Now my car looks as good as the day I bought it 
THIS SOAP IS SIMPLE TO USE AND OBTAINED A GREAT RESUL 
A superior soap, cleans about anything. The entire Mr. Clean Auto Dry system is great. This takes oil, brake dust, greese, off with just a little effort. Bugs tar you need to work at a little more but it does come off. I found that if I spray everything down well first then soap work from the top down I was better off. 
I think the best part of this scale is the fact that I can put a plate on it, then turn it on and the plate weighs as zero. I can then add food onto the plate as an exact portion size. Being able to check for carbs, fat, protein etc has been a real eye opener 
I mix it in the blender with a variety of ingredients such as skim milk, water, frozen berries, and it's delicious. I've started making a larger shake by adding more water and a scoop of SlimFast powder, and it makes for a very satisfying meal that keeps me full for hours. It's worked much better than any of the hoodia pills I've tried. Just wish it weren't quite so pricey, or I would give it 5 stars 
I recently started using the phytobase Hoodia DeLite shakes every morning for breakfast. I have been having the shakes almost a month now and have not gotten tired of them, at all. I believe the hoodia gordonii really does work to supress appetite. Feeling hungry all the time has been an obsticle for me in the past. After using these shakes for a few days, I felt less and less hungry each day. Now, I have no problem getting through the day without the nagging hunger pangs. The taste is fantastic. It can be mixed with milk or water. I usually mix it with fat-free organic milk and I like to add frozen berries. The frozen berries add a little more sweetness and make the mix thick and creamy. The best thing about the mix is how many vitamins and minerals it has. It has 50% or more of almost everything. I have definitely the difference since I started having these dailies. I have more energy and less fatigue. My biggest complaint is the price. It is around $30 for 18 servings. That is about 3x the cost of similar products, such as Slim Fast. The advantage of the Phytobase product is that it is low calorie, sugar free and made from organic ingredients. I think when you compare the benefits of the Phytobase to commercial products, like Slim Fast, Phytobase ends up coming out ahead and worth the cost. Still, I would like to see the price come down about $10. Overall, I like this product. If you don't mind spending the extra money, I think it is worth it 
I've read mixed reviews of this but as an avid shake drinker, I have to say this is the best tasting one I've tried. It's the first shake I haven't had to doctor up with juices and such. Seriously, it's good as is! I also read that people had a hard time mixing it. I found that if you shake it and let it sit a minute, then shake it again, it mixes great. If you shake it once and try to drink it immediately, you might find some mix still in there. When I wait a minute or two between shakes, it is perfect. I also find half skim milk and half water are a great blend. Finally, it really seems to actually supress my appetite, which amazed me. So far I love it! It's expensive and that would be my only complaint. But if you are looking for a really nice shake that helps you eat less, it's worth the money. 
The hoodia based shake mix makes a suprisingly tasty meal! I've also noticed it makes me feel full and I don't get as hungry as soon when I use the hoodia capsules. So many of the meal replacement shakes tast pretty nasty, but this stuff is quite nice. Your tast buds will be surprised 
Received them in time and in good condition. Overall, I am happy with the purchase of this product. I bought this item along with the $30 off of $99 or above purchase Offer, which even makes this product a good bargain 
The kids love how quick and easy we can get them cleaned up, the parents love how easy it is to keep these around. We loved the price on amazon, and indeed, even had trouble finding them in stores at any price 
This stuff actually helps, probably from the overload of caffeine but I get less tired during my workouts and have begun to notice my muscles are bulking up more than when I just took whey protein. Also, the taste of this stuff is surprisingly good. I would actually consider the taste to be enjoyable 
Do not use this or you will Xplode. If you enjoy bananas, this product is certainly for putting in water and mixing. Why doesn't the Bomb Squad just carry some of this around 
'm 21 and I just bought NO a lil while ago, and Im already noticing an amazing difference. I'm actually a lot more focused when I go to the gym, and I'm able to do a helluva lot more weight and reps than I normally do. My chest already seems to be sticking out more than it ever has, and it feels more toned. Great product buy no-xplode today on amazon.com for 41.42 bucks dont go at gnc or gnc.com to pay 60.00 bucks amazon is the best to get this item and no-xplode works good it works guys 
My son was so gassy we tried everything to relieve his pain. This one had instant relief and didn't taste so bad. When he wakes up in pain at night and sees me coming with his medicine he is so happy he opens wide and takes it with ease. Best stuff in the world 
I always use these types of drugs for energy boosts, not as a daily supplement for weight loss. One capsule will keep you alert with no noticeable effects, where 2 will give you that jittery feeling for an hour or so. If taken before exercise, I tend to feel extremely warn out afterwards, but in a good way, like it just really enhances the burn. My water in take definitely increases when I take it. As far as other types of similar drugs, this pretty much falls in line with the rest 
My first day with Zantrex3 is so far.. nothing, i took two pills before i had lunch today and still ate the same, no symtoms whats so ever, pretty much all im feeling is a little more energetic. I'm a 16 year old male and well.. i ordered this to lose weight and have some energy.. Maybe for all you people that are complaining just aren't used to the caffeine? Or.. perhaps its just me and i'm lucky to not be feeling what others are? Well i'll write another review about this product when my 84..82 pills run out. Will tell my results, so far nothing special. Wish me luck 
My daughter tried this stuff first and hated it. It made her feel sick but also disoriented. She was trying to read a magazine but couldn't understand a word of it. She gave them to me and I took one before heading off to a meeting. I was asked to take the minutes but really struggled to concentrate to do so. I suddenly felt so jittery and dizzy. I couldn't focus on any object or understand what was being said. I was afraid I would have a heart attack or something. I had a very disoriented and disconnected feeling. Thank God I wasn't driving! This is definately not a good product for many people 
My husband took this as directed for "1" day and at 1:00 am that night he had a very bad Grand Mal Seizure. He had never had any type of seizure before and was rushed via ambulance to the hospital. I thought he was dying in front of my eyes, after the seizure, he was choking for air unconsiously on foam and blood that was in his mouth. Several minutes afterwards he could not talk and did not know what was going on. His speech was like that of a stroke victim. Finally he was able to speak but then did not know where he was or what day it was. The paramedics and fire dept were there by then. All of his blood tests, ekg, blood pressure and blood sugar tests perfomed while in the ER were perfectly normal, we were told it was the Zantrex - 3.. Please protect your loved ones and do not take a chance with your life over this product. God bless 
I am a healthy 34 yr old female and I've been taking it for a week now. I have never had so much sustained energy . That's what Zantrex3 does. It's not a miracle pill, it doesn't melt fat, it gives you the energy to do what's necessary to burn the calories quicker than if you had little or no energy. It's not for everyone, but for those who do not suffer side effects, its a great energy boost. The first night I had trouble sleeping, but after that, I worked out so hard at the gym, I had no choice but to fall into bed tired at the end of the day and sleep like a baby. I'm very happy with the weight lost results in the first week; 3 lbs. I was at a plateau with my exercise program/weight loss for three weeks, this was the breaker. I'm very happy with the decision to use this product 
My sister took 2 pills a day for only 2 days, she has stopped taking it for another 2 days and is now hospitalzed. She still has chest pain, shaking, and difficulty breathing and swallowing. She was perfectly healthy before taking xantrex 
My wife works at a health clinic and I was constantly getting colds and sniffles ETC from the "bugs" she was around all day. Since we got this little gem (3 months ago)I haven't once had any germ/virus related symptoms. It's a little pricey but it beats having a cold for weeks on end. Plus it's very cool looking. My advice to anyone that is susceptible to colds and the flu, get one of the babies, hook it up in your bedroom and run it 24/7 at full speed (you won't even hear it). And for people looking for the replacement UV lamp, just Google Germ Guardian and they have all the parts for all their units 
I purchased one of these for our great room and I also purchased the GG-1000 model for my sons bedroom. Our Family had been passing around soar throats, colds and the kids had ear infections since October. They would get better from the antibiotic and as soon as they were off it, they would be sick again. Since putting this in our home, (knock on wood) no one in the family has had a cold and that is awesome, especially because of the holidays and all the stomach flu-like symptoms that were going around...we didn't get it!!! I have ended up putting one of the GG-1000 UV models in every bedroom and one in the kitchen as well. I highly recommend this unit based on the few months we have owned them 
The UV light went out on the sanitizer five days after using 24 hours a day. There is no restriction as to the amount of usage. Where can you get replacement lights 
I'm thrilled with this product. It has made a tremendous difference in our home. It really does control the spread of germs. I can't tell you how exciting it is not to have my three children continue to reinfect each other. I highly recommend getting a couple, one for the bedroom and one for the family room. You won't be disappointed 
After using the razor for many years, the new blades made it as good as new 
The item I bought meet my expectations in regards to quality and delivery tim 
This was the only place I could find these blades. The price was good and the turnaround time was excellent 
product arrived in a timly manor, good construction, enjoying close shaves. robert schulker 
Received the item in record time, and in good condition. Saved money buying replacement heads (as opposed to buying a whole new razor!) and didn't have to go from store to store to find them - Good deal 
Purchased these blades for my dad's electric shaver. They last a long time. Though a dermatologist I spoke to recently told me that electric shavers tend to burn the skin... the docs have been able to clinically prove this.. For white/fair skinned guys... it should be okay the doc said... but for tan/dark skinned guys.. the burning would be more noticeable. Again this was a reputable dermatologist who told me this and he referenced various studies supporting these facts... told me to stick with the manual Gillette Mach3 blades ... takes a little more work and time, but worth it overall. Happy Shaving :- 
Product works fine. And the price is right. Satisfied 
The razor is awesome. I replaced the blades with this replacement set, and it works fine. Amazon.com's packaging was tremendously wasteful. It was mailed in a 12"x9"x4" box, and the postage was quite high. The product itself was the size of an index card and could have been sent in a CD mailer or a "letter"-sized package. I understand that for efficiency they reduce the number of packaging options, but this seems a little excessive. If you bought one CD, would it come in a foot-long box 
I have been a Norelco customer for over 27 years and I have never had a set of cutters dull so quickly. In my opinion the quality is dow 
Amazon notes that these bags are easy to life and carry--and they are right. The black color of the bags helps to make your refuse more private, too. This is important in this day of identity theft. The bags have drawstrings that you should draw tight and then tie; but I recommend that you also tie the very top part of the actual black bag itself for extra strength so it definitely won't break when you take out the garbage. Hefty lives up to its name as being extra strong. I tried several store brands but none of them were as thick and durable as Hefty. In my opinion Hefty is the brand to buy. The 33 gallon capacity makes these garbage bags great for both families and single people. The bags are economical, too. At the Amazon price they cost roughly 35 cents each and that's a good deal especially because a bag can usually handle two days' worth of garbage. Highly recommended. 
If your looking for a bar that hits the spot without leaving you wanting more this is the bar for you provides great flavor and satisfies I highly recommend this bar for in between snacks not to high in fat has more carbs than other protein bars but is a great overall ba 
For once, I don't have to do a "public service" by going to clifbar.com and looking up the ingredients and nutritional information; Amazon.com has it all at the top of the product page. Now, I can focus on taste! That's a good thing, because this (along with the Clif Z-Bar, chocolate) is one of the better tasting "nutritional" snacks of its kind. It has just enough chocolate (brought to you by chocolate chips (which include organic cane juice, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa butter, and unspecified "natural flavors") to actually impart a chocolate flavor. Not a heavy or rich chocolate flavor, but an unmistakable one: You don't have to close your eyes, and convince yourself that it's chocolate. (Ever notice how permeable artificial flavors can be? Let's say you're eating a Popsicle--excuse me--a frozen fruit treat. You close your eyes, and the flavor clues are all but gone. Think purple, and its tastes like grape; think orange, and it's orange, think light blue and it's bubble gum--if you know the code, that is.) This is like a giant Bit-O-Honey candy, it has that chewy texture over laden with honey, with some sticky peanut butter and chocolate thrown in, and you've pretty much captured the flavor. To my surprise, there is no honey, that taste derives somehow from the syrups, malt, cane juice, fig paste, and other sweet ingredients. It's definitely filling, especially if accompanied by an apple or something, and at least eight ounces of water. It's very chewy, yet it doesn't seem as dry as similar products. Could it be the six grams of fat-two of which are saturated? Yes, two grams of saturated fat! NOT good. I'll try to balance that with the fact that it's made from 70% organic ingredients, has a whopping 11 grams of protein, only 20 grams of sugar (compare that with other brands and flavors), and includes five grams of fiber. Along with Clif's Z-bar and the excellent Clif apple raisin walnut, this is one of the better tasting of its kind--just don't expect a brownie 
I received the product quickly, it was in great shape, and I will buy more as soon as I eat all these up 
I use this book butler every day. I like to read while I eat my breakfast. I like almost everything about this product. I really would give it a 5 stars minus. The minus being that the clips holding the pages are not the easiest to deal with. It does give you total hands free while you are reading the open pages, and that is what I was seeking so I am well satified 
I eat in restaurants all the time using one of these, and I get a non-stop parade of people stopping by my table to ask what it is and where they can get one. Generally works very well (only extremely large or very small books are occasionally difficult; paperbacks and textbooks work fine). Holds the book reliably with no hands, yet you can turn the page easily. Folds up pretty flat (about the thickness of a book) so it's easy to carry. I own several and am buying a couple more for gifts 
The pages sometimes get stuck on the posts when u turn them, you have to put straws on the posts for it to work, and it doesnt fold up like it says. The only good thing about it is that it does hold a book open, which is good for people who can't do that themselves 
Product looks very different on-line. Not as thick as viewed. Gave as a gift. They seem to like it 
Great in the car and canoe. Susan Manassas, V 
I got the cushions hoping to relieve my pain when we travel, it works great. We liked ours so much that I bought our daughter and son-in-law each one for Xmas so that when we go west next year it will make the trip alot easier to sit for such a long time. I have bought 4 cushions so far and recommend them highly if you have a job where you must sit alot or do alot of driving. We love ours! 
I have a back injury that keeps me from walking much of the time, and having a comfortable seat means the difference between functioning or being trapped in bed with pain for days at a time. I had been looking for a new wheelchair seat (this is a seat cushion for regular chairs, not wheelchairs), and this gel seat caught my eye. I bought two, and am thrilled with my purchase. The way the gel is distributed in the seat helps me sit straight up and not lean to one side, and allows my legs to get proper blood circulation. Obviously, this isn't a product for everyone, but when I'm not using a cushion, another family member is always "trying it out." I've gotten so many comments from the spouse tha I'm seriously consider buying enough for each of us. At the very least, I an buying one more cushion for my high-school aged kid's desk chair. The chair that came with the desk is a hard wooden task chair that even looks uncomfortable. I asked the kid to try out the gel cushion, and it was reported that the cushion is such a success that I am not getting it back. Figures 
This is my daughter's favorite perfume which she requested for Christmas and I purchased it for her 
I just love these batteries. They last longer than Energizers and work with all sorts of gadgets. The price as it is now just can't be beat 
These things are absolutely marvelous! Seriously folks, these little miracles are by far the best way I've found so far to power portable gadgets, and what's even better is that all of the gadgets are designed specifically for use with these batteries. That's right! No modification necessary! Simply an ingenious product, go out and buy a pack of these things today and see what all the fuss is about! And 
i love this product it makes my hair silky smooth i use i every day. buy it u wont be sorr 
This biosilk makes your haie so soft and silky. It really does work 
If I could have only one hair product, this would be it. I've tried the "cheaper" type products that I got at the discount stores / grocery / drug store and NOTHING comes close. Yes, it's more expensive, but totally worth it. I have VERY think long hair (with a perm and natural curl) and still use a dime size amount. The comb will go through my hair now with ease. It makes it so silky too. I'm not that fond of the shampoo or conditioner in this line, just the Biosilk therapy stuff itself 
This is probably the best serum I have ever used ! It did seem a little pricey to me at first... considering i can just go down to wal mart and buy a bottle of serum for less than half the price of this but it is so worth it ! I got my first bottle of biosilk silk therapy in May and i still have more than half the bottle left ! I use it about 3X a week along with my hair straightener and the results are amazing ! I have a lot of split ends due to coloring and heat styling and this seems to seal them right up.... it also doesnt weigh down your hair and it doesnt have any scent to it which is nice. I dont think I'll ever switch back to any other hair serum ever again !! 
I have longish wavy hair that I color occasionally. My hair tends to frizz up and look frazzled out, even though I never use a blow dryer. I have tried a lot of different hair-smoothing products, from shampoos to conditioners to leave-in lotions. But this stuff! It makes my hair sleek and silky in a way that no over-the-counter stuff I have ever found could. It's not goopy or gel-ly or oily like many anti-frizz products. I think it's silicone-based, so it just slithers onto your hair and then makes it look like a '70s shampoo commercial. (If I also use a straightening wand for special occasions, it looks like "princess hair.") My hair also feels about 500% softer than it does without it. Not just subtly softer, if you're paying close attention, but like the difference between those new kind of plush toys that have extra-silky fur, compared to the old-fashioned kind of stuffed-animal fur. (I've had guys compliment me on the softness of my hair since I started using it.) This is a "desert-island" product for me! I had a shampoo-sized bottle (not sure of the exact ounces) and it lasted nearly two years
