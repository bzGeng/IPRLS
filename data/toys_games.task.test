1	my 2 year old loves it ... though one set of grandparents ca n't stand the noise so if you do n't like noisy toys - obviously this is n't one for you . otherwise its great ! runs out of battery very quickly though .
0	like many others , the arm on my 4 year olds excavator broke as well who can we contact for help ? there is no information on the box
0	if you want a beautiful asian doll , i just found a couple in ebay under `` asian berenguer girl doll `` . the one i got on ebay was gorgerous ! ! ! my daughter loves it and wo n't leave home without it .
1	everyone in the children 's room at the avon library loves the gazillion bubble machine . it is used frequently during story hours and captures all the chidren 's attention . it 's not necessarily educational but is alot of fun
0	we got this for our son for easter , and he was playing with donnie the dumptruck , and the handle part was opened , so it was the flat blue portion of the truck , well he some how slipped , and ended up cutting his forehead b/c the blue portion does have somewhat of a sharp part . luckily enough it was n't where he needed stitches , but still ... so i called little tikes , and they said they wanted me to mail it back and they let me choose another toy-so there customer service at little tikes is definitly a + ! just watch out because i think the ages on this toy should be a little older . semper f
0	the seller shipped promptly but the merchandise disappointed ... materials/workmanship not so hot ; my husband stuck his hand all the way through a side panel while setting it up . since there was no taking it back from our 2-year-old after he saw it , he now has a tent with an extra window in it . child is delighted with the toy , parent is not delighted with durability
1	my daughter really wanted this for christmas . she really has played and played with it ever since . i wish that it came with some dry erase markers for the board in it but other than that we have been very pleased with the product
1	i purchased the game to play at a christmas party . it was a lot of fun . thank yo
1	i stumbled upon this game years ago , and my family has enjoyed it -- even my adult friends , who seemed to balk at first at playing a kids ' game . this past year , i decided to purchase it for my sixth grade classroom . i must say ... wow . i allowed the kids to play it for a while during homeroom , and kids would be waiting early outside the room to get in and snag the frog juice . they would even play it over other outdoor games at recess . anytime you heard a `` noooo ! '' in the room , you knew someone had pulled out the witch wash . the kids loved it . so , i have come back to purchase a new deck for this upcoming year . to any educators who might be reading this , it makes a great addition to the intermediate classroom for those few minutes of downtime , and because of the math and bit of strategy involved , you do n't feel guilty about it at all . plus , it is something different and for the teacher , inexpensive as far as games go
0	since purchasing this `` executive '' set , i have purchased another one at a local store . although both sets are relatively the same , the instruction package with my second set is much better . the sea monkeys in the `` executive '' set lasted about a month and a half . this was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague . we did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them . the instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over 3 months . i believe the `` executive '' set is overpriced as well
1	our entire family loved the hand held game , as a matter of fact we ended up buying 5 of them total eveyone wanted one . i would highly recommend this item to everyon
0	well , now this carry case is a goner . the latch will no longer close and the top rim is hopelessly bent . it was fun while it lasted
1	this is great ! no more lost cartridges or torn books . very easy for my four year old to store all her leap pad items
1	this product was exactly what i was looking for . i recieved it in a timely manner and the merchant communicated kindly and proactively with me about the shipment . thanks
0	i bought this sippy cup seeing how informative the review was.. and i was happy when i saw it and my baby liked it.. but whn i went to wash it , i cleaned the valve , by removin a obvious piece that had to be removed to clean ... and it never was able to attach corrctly it will fall in her drink and completely get my babys face all wet so after one use i had to discard it ... maybe it was defected but i was not satisfied with it
1	i especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms . my only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen . it has a contrast adjustment , but it not very helpful . it also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either . a great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast .
0	my son loves to `` drive '' cars . i saw this and thought he would love it . it is totally unrealistic , doesnt make much noise ( which for some parents that would be a + , but in this case its not ) and it is not entertaining at all . paid entirely tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at all . i have tried letting some of my friends children play with it , and they dont seem to enjoy it either .
1	if you are not a literature professor or do n't read everything that the library gets in , you will probably find this game extremely difficult . on the other hand , you now have a book list
0	i bought this shopping cart for my 14 month old daughter who absolutely loves her little mommy doll . she enjoyed taking the food out of the shopping cart but when she tried putting it back in the basket fell off the frame and she got quite upset . also , at her age it is difficult to get the doll into the seat portion without assistance from mom . the cart itself also does not turn well when tried to walk with it
1	i always thought clue looked like a complicated game i 'd never touch ! that is until i played it at my friends house ! now i 'm a clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions ! this game can never get old because it 's a different outcome every time ! i strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older
1	we just got this for my daughter 's 5th birthday . this toy was what received the greatest excitement . while opening presents , my daughter exclaimed at the the top of her lungs , `` i got a brietta pegasus ! '' the pegasus itself is durable , beautiful , and creatively sparks hours of imaginitave play . i did n't think it was a big deal trying to get it out of the box . many toys are packaged that way these days ... perhaps an anti-theft plan . i just got some scissors and brietta was out to play . so far we also have n't had any trouble with the wings . if they do fall out occasionally- they pop right back in . a small price to pay for such a well-loved toy that my 5 year old plays with for hours . as a mom who also loved unicorns and pegasus ponies as a girl , i 'm glad i can give that magic to my own girls
1	i love melissa and doug toys , they 're always well-made and always thoughtful . they encourage learning and their pieces , made of natural material , not only hold up well but are environmentally friendly . this game is a particularly nice example . it 's a classic wooden puzzle with a twist . each vehicle puzzle piece has a magnet on it and the players yank them out with a magnetic `` tow truck '' . melissa and doug have made two other puzzles similar to this , a fish puzzle and a butterfly puzzle , with the same concept . this one , however , might appeal more to kids whose current fascinations lie more along the lines of cars and trucks . one of our pieces ( on the fishing version of this puzzle ) did stick , but a quick rub around the edges with some sandpaper loosened it right up . the downside of using real materials is that wood does have a tendency to warp in humidity or dryness . that 's a downside i 'm willing to live with ! excellent toy !
0	this item is nothing like picture poorly made i could have made a better one myself out of old pillow cases.not worth the money avoid this item
1	this is a great , simple , fast game that is fun for all ages
1	i bought this for my grandson , and he no sooner got it out of the box ( with help ) , and he was outside in the sand with it , having a great time . can not lose with these oversized trucks for little hands . it is a good purchase
1	this is a very handy product to have around for our 3-year old if the batteries happen to die while traveling . the ac adapter is a life-saver for long car trips . just as an aside note , the adapter does not look like the one in the picture . it is gray-and-orange , like the adapters you seen in the store
1	we purchased this game for our son for christmas . he is a chess lover , and we wanted to get him something a little different . chaturanga was perfect , since it is the precursor to chess . he has enjoyed the game . all of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition . it is an attractive box . we are very pleased with every aspect of it
1	we love this game . we were first introduced to it at our children 's preschool where it fast became a favorite at `` free choice time '' . the children engaged in it delightfully and playfully . everyone has fun . the game board is durable and can be constructed differently over and over again -- this works out so great because with all the repeated play ours gets the kids are not memorizing the spot the item was . i worried a little that it might be too competitive and those that were `` better '' at it might leave those not as quick at hunting feeling discouraged , but have not ever found that to be the case when we have the game out at home or at the school . the board is brightly colored the items are fascinatingly fun to search for . it is a challenge even for us big kids . i would recommend it highly for a fun family activity game
1	a `` jewelry box '' for your little girls polly pocket accessories . my daughter received this as a gift for christmas and loved it ! would be perfect if it was just a little bigger but is definitely worth the money
1	we recently purchased this playhouse , and discovered that it does not come with the peek-a-boo shutters ( i do n't see the shutters in the photo either although they are mentioned in the product description ) . our 3year old and 18 month old both enjoy it , but i would say it is more fun for the 18 month old than my 3 year old since there is little to actually `` do '' inside the house . the doorbell makes fun sounds . it is very easy to put together
1	my daughters love this supermarket checkout ! they 've had it for a few months and have n't lost interest . i would recommend it for any child who likes to play pretend . the quality is what i expected ... works fine
0	i could n't wait to get this for my 18 month daughter . much to my disappointment , i get it and it does n't work . i returned it and received a replacement . that one also did n't work . i am in the process of returning it and wo n't ever buy from amazon.com again
0	this thing took about 6 hours to build . the directions are terrible and extremely difficult to follow , but i figured it was worth it because it just looks so cool . unfortunately after completely assembling the thing and flipping the switch the motor , on fresh batteries , did n't have enough power to lift the ball the almost 6 feet consistently . we spent as much time trying to get the motor to do what it was supposed to as we did building it . ours also came with a special ball that had a skateboarder inside . he looks really cool , but the motor never was able to lift him more than about a foot . i love knex , but this set is a dud
1	i bought this mostly for the container . i had individual play-doh products , like the barber set that came in it 's own box . i 'm able to put all play-doh things into this container and everything is in one spot . no more boxes and sorting . i even still have space for more things like different colors and everything . my daughter loves the variety of the toys and i love the convenience . i 'm going to buy it for presents for other families i know !
1	i was very pleased with this product , it covered the back seat and has a handy little pocket to put bottles , wipes , dipers in . i have brought another two for the other car
0	i bought two bionicles for my son 's stocking at christmas . he is 5 so i had to help him put them together . it took forever to construct this sad little robot and within minutes of playing with it , it began to fall apart . the instructions are not clear and the overall durability just stinks . if your child just wants to construct them and display them , then this is great . if your child wants to play with them , forget it . go buy a preassembled action figure and move on with your life
1	i ca n't put it any better than the others before me have . i did a lot of research before purchasing this train and am so glad i decided to spend a little bit more money for a ton more quality . this is truly an heirloom train set that will be around longer than i will be ( and i 'm only 35 ) . the other reviewers are also correct in advising that you shop around before purchasing this train set . the prices vary wildly . yes , it hurts a little to spend this kind of money on a train set when you know there are others out there . however , the others are cheaper for a reason ... they 're junk . you simply ca n't do better than this set
0	worst product ever . i really trust crayola , but am having doubts after these new outdoor products . theyre just terrible- made shotty- they dont work.. i am very disappointed . this spins so fast that none of the paint comes out- then it just pours out in a big wet mess . just awful
0	i 've owned this toy for a few weeks and have given up on it . at first this toy was a little fun and i was optimistic about getting it to handle correctly . i 'd adjust the top screw to trim it from spinning clockwise or counter clockwise and everything . this gets old after doing it every time after a charge . next , using the forward and backward control does n't work that well . also , it will drop out of the sky or do something weird every now and then . all in all i would n't buy it again , especially at the higher price it is currently going for . try the smaller havoc , it seems to handle a little better ( youtube has a few movies of it flying ) . [ ... ]
0	got a very similar model at a babies r us several months ago , but without the adult 's handle . my son is almost 2 and can almost pedal by himself , and we generally like the style , but the trike tips so easily that i rarely take it out for him to use . never would have thought to check this but i 'll be in the market for a big-wheel type trike or one that is much more stable than this model .
0	if you 're a fan of the evil child-killer mr. fred krueger , then add this item to your collection as well . you can always trust neca to provide with great horror movie replicas . the figure is based on his latest entry ; freddy vs jason
1	we got this toy for my son when he was 2 1/2 years old he is now 4 years old . it still runs like new . he drives it like a champ . we have used it to haul mulch to the back yard and some yard bricks . it never fails us and he think he is a big helper which he is . i am thinking of buying a 2nd one for my younger son now .
0	this tor breakes when you build tall buildings , but i made a mouse out of them . when the magnets are pushed back that makes me angry , but you can make people by just putting four magnets on one ball , but in all i say you shuld decide yourself .
1	i received this ty pig as a baby shower gift . my son `` discovered '' it when he was 18 months old and it 's his dearest companion besides his `` night-night . '' piggy must go for car rides , eat with him , get jammies on and go to the dr. to have his temperature checked . we love piggy because when he 's covered with milky cheerios , we can just throw him in the washer and dryer . he 's good as new in about an hour . who would n't love that ? it 's also a great toy for allergy sufferers because it can be thoroughly cleaned regularly to remove dust mites . we love it and my son loves it . now we ordered a spare piggy so that there is a piggy substitute when piggy is bathing . enjoy your toddler
1	it is a magnificient item ! so simple and beautiful yet full of really small details and `` hello , here is johnny cash ! '' looks really great on foot with his guitar . just like real . i strongly recommend it to all cash fans
1	after reading other reviews , i , too , purchased this to use to practice agility with our dog . i was n't sure it would be large enough . she is an english setter . it works perfectly for this size of dog . she is approx . 35 lbs , med . size dog . cind
0	i thought this would be a great addition to our tub toy collection , i was wrong . it does n't work ! ! ! ! we tried shampoo and baby wash in it and there was no `` mountain of bubbles '' . this product does n't work , save your money ! !
0	i was very dissapointed with the product , it was displayed as something that was simple to use and fun for all ages ... .i ordered 4 of them for my grandchildren and when they opened them for christmas , we found that they were `` clumsy '' to use , the sound quality is poor at best , and they are made of hard plastic which is not particularly safe to be `` whacking '' on anything and everything as i was led to believe . we are a musical family and therefore more inclined to try to produce music from various sources , but i am afraid this is not worth the money . if i had opened them before christmas i would have returned them , but it was too late so now they are stuck with them
1	i got this for the price , $ 4.99 . i put it together 2 days ago and my 4 year old daughter has spent almost every waking hour playing with it . the first thing she asks me in the morning : `` will you play mermadia with me mommy ? pretty please ? '' the parts come off easily but do not fall off . my daughter is a little rough on her toys but since the pieces of this are easily taken apart and put back together it is great for her . she loves it .
1	toby is one of the regulars on the thomas his friends tv series , and this little wooden tram engine is well-made and durable for those who have the wooden railway sets . my only complaint - and this is very minor - is that toby is a bit taller than other wooden thomas engines , meaning that he can not fit under bridges very well
0	this toy seemed like a fun idea , however it is utter chaos . the toy moves randomly over the page and does not make any sort of comprehensive design . actually our table received more ink than the paper and then the kids could not get it to turn off . i think it may be slightly posessed !
1	i bought this toy for my daughter almost a year ago now . she still plays with it all the time . it is by far her fav toy . the only problem is that it 's a bit too load and no way to turn it down , or off . well , besides that it is a perfect toy for small kids . my daughter is almost 4 and still is not tired of it
1	this toy is fantastic . although i have the english speaking toy , it still has a similar sounding italian accent to the toy . if you enjoyed the films , i highly recommend these toys ! ! ! is it possible to buy an italian speaking luigi
0	i bought this puzzle for my kid after he solved the original cube . i had read the review here and other places stating that one needed to be cautious when turning the puzzle . however , our major problem with it was that the orange stickers ( within ten minutes of playing with the cube ) began to peel back and fall off . we tried using glue ( they had no stick to them ) to put them back but it was not long after that the green stickers began curling back and falling off as well . the major problem is that these turned out not to be `` stickers '' after all , but rather colored squares of vinyl adhereing to additional stickers beneath ( all white ) by means of static . they fall off easily . this is a nice puzzle for show ( impressive on the desk ) but not for actual continued use . hopefully , rubik 's can use proper stickers or adhesive in the future and maybe even tighten up the design so that this can be used as a fun puzzle
0	like others said the microphone stand broke very easily and the whole toy is not durable at all . the legs and the stool do not stay together whatsoever . my son has to sit with it on his lap to play it . i would not recommend this toy to anyone
0	the beads and charms are nice enough , but for the price you get very little with this kit -- only about 50 tiny glass beads and 50 spacers , plus the charms . there 's nothing here special enough to justify spending the money -- there are plenty of nicer jewelry kits out there that are more generous with the supplies
0	when putting together the mobile section of this item , i was very disappointed in its flimsiness . it looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic . when i turned it on i was disappointed a second time , this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes as it rotates . it 's so loud you ca n't hear the music , which is a shame because i 'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving lights . the third disappointment - the buttons are very hit-and-miss . sometimes the music buttons do n't work ( the lullaby one worked eventually once i mashed it in really hard ) . that i could live with , but it 's fiddling with the other controls that is really irritating . control for music off , lights on/off and rotation on/off all seem to be tied up in two buttons . if you have the music and lights going , then turn on the rotation , the music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on . then you have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you get them all going the way you want them . please bear in mind i am not particularly daft - i managed to figure out my tivo remote in a day or so - but the controls for this baby 's musical mobile make no sense to me . i thought at first it was supposed to be deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby 's natural curiosity ' , but after two nights it really got on my nerves , and if i ca n't figure it out , i do n't see how my one year old is supposed to . i can only think that there is something very screwed up with the circuitry in there . i 'm not dismissing this item all together . the music is lovely - not too simplified and not too electronic-sounding . the minute waltz is particularly nice ( i 've noticed my son scans for it ) . the lights are lovely too , and do look pretty when they 're moving if you can stand the buzzing . my son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself with as he falls asleep . but , if you buy it , i 'd recommend testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return it .
0	a friend of mine has zombies ! ! ! , also by twilight creations . i 've played it a few times , and found it pretty enjoyable . zombietown is sort of a followup to this in some ways , and tries to expand the strategy of the game somewhat . unfortunately , it ends up far too confusing and complicated to make for fast gameplay ( it 's often very slow , in fact ) , and the strategy is more shallow than risk . ya know the stereotypically confusing instructions of insert tab a into slot b ? that 's pretty much what the instructions to this read like . they 're fairly poorly written to boot . there were also a couple problems we ran into the rules did n't seem to cover . i ca n't recall them off the top of my head , and they did n't come up very often , but it was still irritating . overall , definetly not reccomended . at $ 40 in stores , and $ 35 off amazon , it 's also a huge ripoff . what do you get in the box ? like 100 tiny army men-esque figures , a couple of packs of cards , and a laminated piece of cardboard . i understand why it is expensive , as i 'm sure this was a low budget item and such , but zombies ! ! ! was much less expensive .
0	we just put the stupid thing together and put the batteries in and nothing worked . the light would go on and off , but there were no sounds at all . we made sure we had everything plugged in correctly , but it still would n't work . after all the time of putting it together what a disappointment . i will be calling fisher price tomorrow and seeing if they have any suggests and/or taking it back to toyrus .
1	this set is perfect for a younger child ! having 100 markers to work with is great . i know when i was younger , i loved having little carrying cases for eveything to keep organized ... i wish i had had this cute little case when i was 5
0	how annoyed am i ? today my son is 5 an aunt bought the tmnt monster jam truck ; so we , supposedly , bought the battery to go with it . wrong this does not go with it . son has a toy with no battery , we have a battery with no toy . well done toys'r'crap . will never buy here agai
1	i work at a daycare and have an 11 mo old and can promise this is a great toy ! my baby loves it and she usually gets bored with toys fast . all of the babies like to open and close the door and crawl through . it also has a doorbell that rings and a light that turns on . it plays several different songs and really keeps the attention of older children as well as babies . i highly recommend
0	this is very small . it 's too small for a play kitchen . and you only get one not two like is pictured
1	my daughter recv 'd this from her grandmother for her third b/d and i think its alot cuter than in the picture . it has worked fine for my daughter she has figured out how to work it by herself and even has shown mommy how to turn it on once in awhile . she likes playing the cds with her name in them that her grandpa got her for her b/d . the only thing i did wrong was let my daughter keep it in her room w/o me checking up on her , she went and poured some kind of liquid in the storage compartments so i had to take it away as punishment . i have forgotten about it until i seen this ad which now i think i will get it back out and let her play with it again . i have even played my cds on this while cleaning the kitchen and they sounded fine . my daughter has alot of the princess furniture in her room and this really matched and is very cute , and we have had no problems with this item so far . ( knock on wood ) .
1	i was very happy with the lincoln logs i ordered for my three year old grandson . he has been enjoying them . they seem to be more complicated than they were when my son was his age which was about 35 years ago or close to it . then it was only one small log cabin but this set is a western building . my grandson has still been able to build something that he likes . thank you for making it available
1	i had a radio flyer wagon just like this as a child and loved it , which is why i wanted one for my daughter . we bought ours when our daughter was a year old , and she loved being pulled around the neighborhood in it . now that she 's four , she loves pulling her one-year-old little brother around , or posing for pictures with him in it . we use it for picnicing in the local park , or setting up an impromptu lemonade stand on the front lawn . the wagon seems to keep popping up in our family photos , from the labor day block party to halloween trick-or-treating . it 's a `` classic '' for good reason -- kids love it , and never stop loving it
1	my one year old has had this toy for about 4 months now and it 's still his favorite toy . there is no end to the amount of fun my child has with this toy and he keeps coming up with new ways to play with it . it 's hours of endless entertainment !
0	my daughter just received this as a christmas gift . she was so excited . my husband and mother-in-law went to the tv to install it . 15 minutes later my five year old is in tears . i wish this had been reviewed before we purchased . the graphics are terrible . this will be going back to the store . glad i still have the receipt .
0	i got this toy with my own money and i think i wasted it bigtime ! i play with the products more than the store.i think it should have been bigger and come with more stuff i nd not have had all that crap painted on the card borad backs to the shelves and i think it should had come with plastic strong backs instead of card borad stuff . i uassly take out the card borad backs and make the store be a grocery store i would not buy this toy i would by the nursery playset instead.im 11 yrs ol
1	i bought this car for my 4 1/2 year old son who absolutely loves the movie cars . he also loves those hot wheels cars . i got him this car , and he really liked it . in fact , all of my kids ( ages 4-15 ) like it ! it 's a really cute toy . it 's even great if you are a cars collector
0	great company - terrible toy . my daughter got this toy for christmas and waited all day for daddy to bring home the 4 c batteries which were not included . she was excited until we turned it on . 1 ) the frame is not secure and will open when you reach into the middle to change the picture disk . 2 ) the light is not very bright and will not work in mid-day light . 3 ) the image is quite small - only takes up the middle 3 inches of the paper - not even close to what is pictured on the box . 4 ) the clamps that hold the paper are not easy for tiny fingers to use . 5 ) because the small picture is in the middle of the page and the clamps are on the far edges , you ca n't shift the paper to re-use the paper . you get one tiny picture in the middle of standard size piece of paper and its a waste . the chalk board was fine - but the whole piece slides across the table when you push to draw . big disappointment . get some washable markers and some tracing paper and do n't waste your money on this suprisingly junky toy
0	we got this when our son was about 4 months old and at first he did love it . there was a slight rubber\plastic smell with everything in the tub time tub but we thought it would fade with time . well six months later the smell was still there and our son ended up stop playing with most of the bath toys except the squirting bath buddies.we did all the precautionary steps to keep the bath toys clean yet they grew mold in a very short amount time . the playtime tub toys were good except the teething sailing boats which also had the rubber smell . plus the stacking tubs do not make practical storage because the lids are too flimsy . there are some good points with this product but i feel it is not worth the $ 35 price tag . guess that 's why it was on clearance at the store . it was the combination of quality and price that made me give it only 2 stars .
0	my daughter had this when she was a teenager . now my grandchildren come and play the game she had . to preserve the original game i ordered new ones to replace my daughters game when she had it . the grandchildren , all 6 of them , love playing this game at our house
1	i bought this for my three year old godson last thanksgiving , and he loved it . the pieces are bright , sturdy , and easy to grasp with tiny hands . i 've purchased several melissa and doug products , and i 've never been disappointed
1	i was very pleased with the light sabers , i gave them to my two grandsons for christmas and they loved them , they were made very well , my grandsons are 7 and 5 years old and they played pretty rough with them , they had lots of fun with them
1	my 6 year old absolutly adores junie b. santa brought her the leapter for chrismas and grandma gave her the junie b game . she only puts it down to go to sleep . there are a few games ( word searches and finding a noun/verb/adjective and great for 1st/2nd graders . it is a great learning tool . the software is set up like the junie b jones journal book . if you child loves junie b she will definetly adore the game
0	this is a very cute and realistic set . the measurements are all accurate . the whisk is very dangerous though . it is metal . one of the `` things '' came out of the handle and stuck out like a weapon . one of the kids could have been severely injured had i not found it and thrown it away . if you buy this item , make sure get rid of the whisk !
0	this toy is not good at all ! its hard for the reflecters to stay still and to connect . its hard to trace the picture because you can hardly see your hand ! plus it the picture moves , thats it ! you have to start all over again . its better if you just take a piece a paper and putting it over the picture and traceing it that way , trust me i ended up just doing that
1	my son has really enjoyed this , however , after marks are made with the `` washable '' markers , it actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do come out eventually
0	do n't buy this price increased version . i does n't work any better than the $ 19.95 model . plus it uses twice the amount of batteries . the concept is great , the graphics are great and that 's the end of it . this just like the first plug and play ms pacman ( which i also bought ) and has a joy stick issue . if the manufacturer would take off the games that need the twisting action of the joy stick maybe this would actually be fun to play instead of frustrating . while playing ms pacman which is the only reason i bought these plug and plays ms pacman has a mind of her own , turns corners on her own and runs into the ghosts on her own . it 's impossible to use the joy stick without twisting it during play and then you 're out of control . it 's extremely frustrating . for as popular as pacman and ms pacman were in their day and still are these plug and plays would sell on that merit alone so take off the games needing the turning action of the joystick
0	the game has a nice concept , if it worked . i 've been trying since christmas ( over 3 months ) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today . something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds , but the web site is always down ! ! ! ! ! experancing technical problems ! ! ! and the nice window that pop 's up on the home page from the chief , asking for suggestions goes to a bad link ! ! ! i only gave it 1 star because the review process does n't have a 0 stars . do n't waste any money on this thing ! ! ! !
1	saw this on jay leno and it was a hilarious gift ! tried it out and it dances to the chicken dance song and when you grab its neck it yelpsand pretends to choke then when you let go it continues its dance . i ca n't wait to give it as a christmas present .
1	anything leappad is great . its one of the best things to come from the computer toy area for kids yet . my son is ahead of his class in reading with the help of leappad . at 6 he reads at a midrange grade 1 student and is progressing quickly . i highly recommend this and any other leap pad book and toy . most schools have dropped phonics from the classrooms and leappad has brought it back in a fun form your little one will love..
0	dissapointed with this product ! our daughter can not even play with it without it falling apart ! small pieces that disconnect from swing not a good idea for childrens toys
0	i asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year - she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter ( 2 yrs old at the time ) . she bought the two bikes at the same time , same model , same color , same store . my daughter , who is far more coordinated then my nephew , tips over very easy , my nephew seems to do fine . my daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies . perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily . not sure - but i know i regret that she ever got the bike -it was a total waste of money
0	my son and i have had the same experience with this sticker maker . great fun for the first 5-10 stickers but then the sticker role jammed and i did not have the opportunity to give the insides a good look before i was desparately trying to remember how it all went back together . too bad ... he loved it while it lasted
1	my son has been using this table for the last 3 months and absolutely loves it . he also has the leapfrog table , but gets bored with just one . this table is on the opposite side of our ( toy-filled ) living room , and he will go over to this for a change of pace . he loves elmo and likes to hang on to his head and also mouth it . he likes to use the phone , which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on everything : ) - and also the little bowl under cookie monster . so why four stars and not five ? i do wish the base had a bit more weight to it , but he can easily pull up on it without getting the whole toy over although we 've had a couple of near tips . also , the toy is a little less educational than i feel it could be since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his arm ... so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger , but his arm could press the pig ... and off elmo goes oinking and singing about pigs . still a great toy , with lots of entertainment value , and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs . i bought it on sale and it was worth the money
0	this is the 3rd and by far the most disappointing of all . the sound does n't work . yes , i put the batteries in correctly and yes i turned it on . the van/car kept getting stuck . my son was very disappointed and can only play pretend with it . i did n't pay all that money for an interactive toy and it does n't work . very disappointed in all these sets and will not buy another
0	my daughter received this as a gift we all found it extremely difficult to use . i was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out . it was not at all easy for a child to enjoy . there were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand play . it is too advanced difficult to use for the ages listed . the screen on the monitor was low graphics poor lighting quality as well . this is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter
1	this emperor penguin puppet is a real hit with my 5 year old . we almost never use it as a puppet but rather as a plush toy/pal . this penguin looks round and pregnant , but to my kid , this penguin is a perfect friend . he has pretty much outgrown all of his plush toys , but for some reason , this one has a place in his heart and in his imagination
1	my daughter absolutely loves rarity . it is the perfect size and goes everywhere with us . the bright colorful hair is fun to play with
0	all the cut shapes are the same , so it 's very easy for my 3-1/2 year old to force pieces in the wrong place . the pieces also seem thin and flimsy . the coolest thing about the puzzle is the lunchbox/carrycase . all in all , the quality is much less than i expect from ravensburger . the ravensburger `` thomas giant floor puzzle ( 24 pc ) '' is a far superior product , but no longer complex enough for my kid
1	i bought this brio train set for my 2 1/2 year old niece over christmas , and she absolutely loves it ! it 's a great starter set and can be expanded with other brio track sets . very easy to put together and the pieces are durable . makes a great gift
0	my sons received this for christmas and it 's already out of commission . the quality of the fabric ( more like paper ) is such that the polls very quickly poked through , leaving the folding/elasticated sticks to stick out . it 's a great idea , but if it was a better material so that it would last more than a couple of weeks ... here 's hoping that i can sew up the holes without tearing it more
0	to anyone who buys this toy , keep the box and receipt handy . we may be the odd one out , but we purchased this toy and it did n't work . the legs on manny are to be pulled back to fire a rubber ball . this did n't happen . rapid pushing and pulling of his legs produces 'rapid fire ' , and if we were lucky one would shoot out - after great effort . it comes with three foam balls , two of which fit , the third was slightly too big and would jam . ours is going back to the store today .
1	my daughter ( age 13 ) really enjoyed this game . it provides more options than scrabble , which sometimes frustrates her because her mom and dad are better at that .
0	this is a horrible edition of this game . it has a limited amount of games and it does n't play like the tv game at all . save some money and buy the old boxed editions from [ ... ] or get the newest version ... you 'll like it a lot more .
0	this is the best deck ever ! but if you are looking for armed dragon lv7 go to soul of the deulist booster packs because this does n't have it . but i love red eyes darkness dragon
0	i would n't waste my time buying anything from this company . we purchased the train table for a christmas gift and while assembling it on christmas eve there were quality issues . several drilled holes were not drilled in the proper position and the table surface had several deep scratches . i called and e-mailed the company several times to try and obtain replacement parts and never got a response . most companies want you to contact them when you need replacement parts rather than returning it to the store , but not kidkraft
0	this was very dissapointing ! ! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it . the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade . the mat looks like it comes from the dollar store , or they ran out of color at the factory . my daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one ... .not like the box or commercial !
0	the box was a huge hit with my 4 year old and he loved the extra , `` hidden '' compartment for his treat on the front . ours however got a crack in it within the first few weeks . it must have dropped just right on a corner . it 's still usable , but we 'll probably be switching before christmas break
1	this is a great puzzle ! my son is 2 1/2 and wants to put it together almost every day ! it is amazing to watch him , because every time we sit down on the kitchen floor to do this together he can do it more and more on his own ! and when we are done he is so proud of himself , i love it ! i am online right now looking for more just like it
1	and still loves it 7 months later ! he even takes it camping and plays for hours outside with it . we are getting him more - his dad likes to get in on it , too
1	my 6 year old loves this book . wanting to be like her sister she is learning spanish too ! this is a very well laid out book . enhances the ability for young children to learn a second language
0	the paint brushes are so stiff that they do not even catch the paint when you dip them and then they do not bend to meet the paper they poke the paper- i threw them out after one use
0	i though i hated yu-gi-oh because mostly everyone i played against summoned like a dark magician without even sacrificing weird right : ( so instead i bought the computer yugi the destiny 2 learn how 2 play im a very good duelist now because i have 2 god cards obelisk and shining dragon so i bought this deck and i found this deck was unstoppable
1	both my 3-year old daughter and my 5-year old son ( to his father 's chagrin ) love playing with and endlessly dressing dora . her outfits are darling and my children enjoy mixing and matching ( or not-so-matching in some cases ) the clothes , too . we are looking forward to adding new outfits as well as the armoire and bed - dora needs a place to sleep ! dora is well made and sturdy , and her clothing has even been through the wash and no harm done . and i have to admit ... i 've been known to dress dora a time or two myself . we have the same problem with the shoes not staying on well , but it does n't seem to bother my little ones at all
1	our family loves this game . it brings out the creative side of people of all ages and is very fun to play . there are 5 catigories . movies , weird laws , initials , word meaning , dealers choice . everyone takes a turn orchestrating the game while the rest of the players make up ficticious answers . then that same person reads everyones made up answers along with the correct answer and you have to guess which is made up and which is the correct . we played many times over christmas with teenagers and gramdma too ! everyone was having such a great time we did n't want the game to be over . turn off the tv , make some popcorn and re-connect with your family with this fun , no pressure to win game
1	we recieved this bed as a hand-me-down from a friend 's child who used it until he was eight ( would not give it up sooner ) . my son recieved the bed at two-years-old and is now four . this bed is durable ! the bed we have is twelve years old and looks brand new . it is so easy to wipe clean . my son feels that his bed is special and just adores it . he sees `` regular '' beds other places and feels so proud that his bed is a blue race car . i have a feeling he 'll want to stay in this bed until his feet are hanging off the end . five stars
1	my 3 year old received this puzzle as a gift for his 3rd yr birthday . i was n't so sure if he was ready for the puzzle at the age of 3 , but four months after his birthday together with his cousins he started putting the pieces together . he is now 3.5 yrs . and knows how to complete it all by himself within less than 10min . i give ten stars
0	our family loves all types of memory games , and this is the most attractive . the colorful stripes on the back are great , the pictures are good , the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying , and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box . my only negative comment is that there is no indication which country each child represents . the children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together ... i think it is an obvious teaching opportunity . in fact , i would like to know this myself
1	lots of fun for young children . my kids ages 2 , 4 and 7 all enjoy building creatures with this set . the only negative is that there are n't very many pieces . if more than one child wants to play at a time you will need more sets
1	solid constructed dumptruck . only problem is the dumper is higher then the matching loader . wish the loader raised higher then the dumper for better play ... for my son , not me :
0	i bought the familiy fun pack ( $ 65 ) from the ad on tv ! what a mistake ! when it arrived one tub was open and spilled all inside the box while another unopened tub was nearly dried out . no return label or customer service number was enclosed so i could n't even return it ! it is such a mess and smells like chemicals . it stuck to a votive candle holder ok and it looks kind of cute but when you try to just mold it all it does is stick to everything including your hands . some are really gooey like slimy paint while other tubs are nearly dry and you end up with micro-mini styrofoam beads all over the place and they sink down into the carpeting and wo n't come out . needless to say , it sat around for awhile until it finally made it 's way to it 's new home ... .the trash
0	i nearly bought this until i read that it involves cardboard and stickers . that 's shameful . search amazon 's partners and other major booksellers for the `` nostalgia '' edition of stratego . it runs $ 4 or $ 5 more . it has plastic pieces with metallic paint . this game is a blast ; you and your kids are going to play it a lot
1	i purchased this as a birthday gift for my 11 year old grandson . i knew it would be a hit as my son had received it as a gift from his grandparents as a child and was entertained for hours with it . it did not lose it 's charm for 11 year old boys through the years . my grandson was thrilled with it as well . just enough challenge to keep their interest
0	this game is ok , entertains my children for a little while . i thought everything was ok , but then , after only a couple of months , the cartridges started to malfunction ! we have two leap pads and some games work in one , but not the other ( and visa versa ! ) for the price , i do n't want the toy to not work 1/2 the time after only a few uses . the books seem to hold up pretty good , but the cartridges do n't . and , at a price of around $ 12 each , i was very dissapointed . if the cartridges worked all the time , i would probably give this toy 4 stars , as it is fun ( when it works ) and portable . one last comment for improvement , would be to have the volume be on the outside , not in the book , as the regular volume is a bit too loud and i have to ask my little one to turn it down each time she switches books/cartridges
0	my 4-yr old daughter really wanted this for christmas , and santa was kind enough to bring it for her . the quality is fine , but it just does n't do much . she played with it for the first day , and has touched it maybe twice since . i 've seen these on clearance everywhere i 've gone lately , too . if your child is into playing `` mommy '' , this is cute , but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks does n't really equate to lasting play value with this one
1	my 11 yr old son got these moon shoes at christmas and he plays with them a lot . he has adhd and sensory integrative dysfunction , and the bouncing really soothes him and gets him refocused . i do n't think he ever expected to bounce very high ; he seems to be happy enough with the bounce he gets . when he wants to play with them in the house , i send him downstairs to jump around on the concrete floor to save wear and tear on my hardwoods . the downside for us has been that the bands have started snapping very frequently . at the rate he 's going , he 'll run out of bands long before he outgrows wanting to play with the toy . so if anyone hears of a way to get more bands , please speak up
0	my son received this as a gift . i love that the inside is set up like `` shelves '' . my son loves to organize his trains in it . i do n't like how thin the metal is . it dents as easy as a cola can . if it were made better , it would be worth the money . save your money on this one and find something better made
1	every family , every party , every gathering of kids and adults or combinations of both will love this game
1	i am in my twenties ... i had one of these dogs when i was little and i loved it . it shows kids the way dogs naturally feed their puppies . of course it is only a stuffed animal so it is not going to do anything . but in my opinion it is a very cute toy for a dog love
1	i 'll start off by saying that this is the company to buy naruto headbands from . it is high quality fabric that is very comfortable on the skin and the length will fit around anyone 's head ( trust me , i have a pretty big head ) . the insignia plate is made out of real metal and is engraved superbly . a velcro padding on the back ensures that the plate does n't touch your forehead and cause discomfort . in other words , this headband is like it was plucked out of the show itself , and for the price , it is a very nice addition to any naruto fan 's wardrobe
0	ok so my daughter was 2 3/4 and not 3 ( toy rated for age 3 ) , but she loves elmo and loves playing with this toy . it is somewhat loud an there is no volume control . also after 4 months of use the pen stopped working , rendering the toy worthless . also the binding is weak and my daughter has torn the sheets with normal use . so fun toy while it lasts
0	this toy is a terrible disappointment . it falls apart immediately , is very poorly designed , and ridiculously difficult for a child ( or adult ) to put together .
1	my six month old grandson loves these toys ! they are perfect for the teether and he loves the colors and noise . they hold his attention for much longer than some of his other toys . they are easy for him to hold and shake . i would buy them again in a minute .
1	i bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased . it is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all . the corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on . it will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with . the price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products .
0	i was so disappointed with this item . my son ( who 's 3 ) received this for his bday . the child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son could n't do it . he ended up getting so frustrated , he broke down in tears ! the noises the train makes are much too loud ! and you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track , which we do not have . i was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it 's a peg perego . the manufacturers should 've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it . why could n't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones ? i put it back in the box and back to the store it went .
1	this item showed up on time and without incident ... i 'm not sure what else i can expect from a pair of novelty glasses .
0	bought these beads for my 18 month old . he enjoys taking them in and out of the container . they are made out of thick plastic but are too heavy to stay snapped together . when we snapped 4 or more together they would not stay snapped together because the weight of the beads pulled them apart as soon as they 're moved
1	i love this motorcycle and it is a `` no-duh '' that it does n't run on fuel . really ... think ... what fuel are you going to use . plus , fuel is hazardous to children and a company would n't threaten the lives of innocent children ! that 's my opinion
1	this board is of excellent quality and is highly transportable , but a little small for go players who play avidly . the stones are also small , but they get the job done . why i bought this board was because i wanted to be able to take it with me , without a huge board dragging me down . this fits what i want almost perfectly . thanks
0	purchased 2 pairs for my 8 9 year old daughters for christmas . the shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic . the box includes bunches of black , elastic bands that you need to really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto the shoes to provide the `` bounce '' . the more your child weighs , the more bands you use , but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks . they are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them . once assembled , the kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored . they have n't played with them since . do n't waste your money
1	it takes a few hands to learn all the tricks to this game , but once learned , it is a lot of fun . a good game for four players , and a great game for six players . it generates lots of lively action , with the bidding for the cards . we played this game on a cruise with four strangers . they were no longer strangers , after the game . everyone we have played with say they are going to buy it . that 's how we got it . bought the game after playing with family .
0	i ordered this for my 7 yr old grandaughter for valentines day . upon receipt it was not operable . the user is supposed to ask the `` love ball '' a question , and then turn it over to see the answer under a clear glass window . the answer would not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark liquid
1	my 6 8 year olds sons received this toy for christmas . they are huge pokemon fans so just the fact that it has pokemon pictures on it made the toy worth it . fortunately , it also happens to be fun to play . 2 to 4 players try to allow the fewest balls possible past their own paddles . the fewest points wins . each player has their own scorekeeper for up to 5 games . setting up the game after every round gets a little tedious , however it 's not so bad if everyone helps . the 2 best things for me are that i do n't mind playing ( unlike the actual pokemon cards which are a boring nightmare for me ! ) and it does n't require batteries ! ! my 3 year old daughter likes to play too although she loses every time . we just do n't tell her . if your kids like pokemon , this is a good toy
1	my 3 yr old grandson loves this . he can manage it ok. good gift
1	we played this game with 3 couples and all of us enjoyed in very much we laughed the whole time it was a very enjoyed game for all
1	using his superior intellect and quick wit , einstein takes on all evil doers who dare to engage him in combat . with the energy stored in the mass contained within his mighty chalk piece that he raises confidently in his right hand he commands the vast power of mathematics to defeat those who dare to forget to carry the one
1	very cute product and well worth the money . my three year old loves all the things he can do with it in the bath tub
0	the tail rotor fell off right out of the box on the first throttle up . the landing gear fall off if you do not glue them yourself . not only is it poorly made for the money but it is an extreemly touchy machine . main rotor to tail mixing have to be perfect . final thought ... . after several hours of hard work adjusting the tail to main rotor mix i managed to get it to stay in the air for a few seconds . if you want an r/c helicopter try the japanese made hirobo xrb sr .
0	after hearing a lot of the songs used for other fisher price music toys , i expected the best from this one . i liked the songs included on the rom , but i expect a nice beat and catchy tune . ( like the backyardigans or the doodle bops ) . these songs are performed in a dry sort of way . they are n't even as good as the wiggles and my kids hate the wiggles . it was a bit disappointing
1	my girls , twin 4 year olds , received this when they were 3 and have played with them over and over again in a variety of ways . great for pretend play as well educational- matching of shapes . super durable and not easy to lose . i highly reccomend these cute cupcakes for your little cupcakes
1	this wagon was easy to put together . we use it frequently when picnicking outdoors and going to the park . it is big enough for my 2 year old to lie down and take a nap . it was also large enough to hold our lunch cooler and my daughter . it is very easy to pull around and is very durable
1	7yr old son has had many many hours of fun rebuilding this into many different tracked and wheeled vehicles . quickly lost interest in snow monster part but the vehicle part is easily changed around for new setup each time . highly recommended
0	this was given to my 2 year old as a present . it is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart . the roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with . the concept is good , all the animals and farmer are built very well , but it 's frustrating to me and my son that it wo n't stay together .
0	ok this isnt really a review but more of a reaction to another review , which in my opinion was written by no child . it 's just a doll ... get over it . and stop wasting the space where some of us people actually write real reviews . i just had to say something about that . oh ... i did order this doll but i 'm still waiting for her to arrive :
1	my 6 year old loves this toy . she made all 3 bears at one time . my husband helped her . they are well made and close up in the back with a zipper and special tool , so they do not come undone unless you want to open them and re-stuff them
0	purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren ... .this is boring and absolutely no fun no matter what your age . i guess for almost $ 40 you should n't expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting . does n't even deserve the one star i gave it .
1	my 3 year old opened this for christmas and loved it . who would have guessed that this little car would have been a bigger hit than a lot of the more expensive things he was given ! it does n't get stuck on any surface that we 've tried it on and drives right over things in its path , which my son thinks is really cool ! great toy for a relatively inexpensive price
1	excellent i love chimps and watch all documentaries , so i had to have this one for my birthday and i am thirty seven years old.i would buy from you again
0	the main issue is the controls . we are having a hard time getting this thing to fly well and the idea of pulling down to go down is weird to us pilot types . it tends to just nose dive regardless . we will give it another go at the park tomorrow but so far all it does is crash . that it 's still in one piece is amazing
1	my three year old takes a `` rest '' instead of a nap , which means he stays in his room for a quiet time so mommy has some sanity . he ca n't tell time , so he would come out every 5 minutes to see if rest time was over . in order to keep him in there for an hour i purchased this clock so he can see and hear when his time was up . it works perfectly and he is n't anxious about when his time is up . he understood the concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up . i set the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on out . no more `` is it time yet ? '' . i get my full hour of sanity uninterupted !
0	if you want a beautiful asian doll , i just found a couple in ebay under `` asian berenguer girl doll `` . the one i got on ebay was gorgerous ! ! ! my daughter loves it and wo n't leave home without it .
0	the start button is too difficult for even a three year old to hold down . the battery is tedious to re-charge ( required after every use ! ) . dangerous . when child leans slightly to the side the entire engine will turn over . for all your time and money you will only see a child with a bored expression - or a frustrated child who ca n't operate start button alone . you could tape down the button and then the child must ask for you to stop it . total supervision required any way you look at it . a real expensive , gimicky toy !
1	i wanted my daughter to be able to listen to music without headphones . this product , the fp3 speakers , was perfect . she loves to walk around from room to room singing her favorite songs and carrying this around . it is easy to turn on and very kid friendly . the only downfall is that the price dropped right after i purchased it !
1	love this game . with family and/or friends it 's one of the best card games around . it is easy and does n't require a lot of attention ( you can watch movies , talk , hang out , etc . ) yet keeps your interest . it 's also a game people of many ages can play because it 's not too difficult . a good card game for having friends over to play over dinner or while watching a ballgame .
1	this action figure is sitting on my desk at home . he 's my little computer buddy . it 's really not bad at all , although the plastic hair does n't allow his head to move very much . when i 'm writing , and i get to a point where i need to back off a bit , i pick him up and change the pose , or threaten my daughter with the masamune , or she and i set him up for a couple of humourous pics . it 's great . all hail sephi ! ! ( and you can just hear it , why the heck are you calling me that ? well , why not ? it 's weird and it 's not right ! but , sephi ... . ) hahahaha . ca n't wait to get cloud too . then things in my house will be interesting
0	whoever decided this was good for four year-olds must not be a parent of said age group . my four year-old received this as a birthday present . his adult aunt could barely figure it out . it 's one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it , taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring . we have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it , even though we have the corresponding mystic force power rangers themselves . i think this toy should be perhaps 1/4 of the price listed . simply disappointing
1	sure this does n't make the popular clanking sound going down the stairs as the metal originals , but it still works well , and has been copied by many companies . i even have one with a business name on it . these fun , functional , and keep a kids imagination engaged . no noise or batteries needed . buy someone you know this for a stocking stuffer this year
1	whenever we take this bike to the park , boys and men of every description crown around it in awe . my son , who is seven and so far not athletic at all , loves the recognition , not to mention the nifty spin outs he can perform for everyone watching . we just wish it came in an adult size
1	i got this for my 3 year old niece . she loves it and requests that it go with her all the time . the box to hold all the pieces is handy , the magnets are easy and there 's lots of variations of outfits . having 2 dolls makes it easy for friends , parents etc to play along and interact . the only cons i see is that the box with all the pieces is a bit heavy , it could use a handle . and the magnets are strong but sometimes the pieces slip a bit . all in all , a great gift and toy !
1	i just got the whole set of geotrax and really think they look great and way cheaper than thomas however the round housecan only hold one train at a time so it derails the train if you have more than one locomotive . they really need to add the reverse as well so they kids and me ( mom ) lol can really make use of all the options . however , overall i really love this toy but yes i had to convert my office room into the geotrax room . be ready to do this if not stick to the basic set up . its very hard though since it all is so coo
0	this product arrived with none of the hardware needed to assemble . the table itself looked as if was used or returned for being substandard . all in all , not a good experience . i will not purchase anything from this seller agai
1	this figure of the great wayne gretzky is a must-have for those who collect hockey memorabilia . the figurine is life-like , with gretzky 's expression looking just as it did whenever he scored a goal . what i love most about this toy is that you can purchase gretzkys that wore different jerseys to represent the eras in hockey his playing career spanned . if you are like me and collect gretzky memorabilia ( pictures , cards , jerseys , etc ) , this is an artifact that will fit quite nicely in your collection .
1	i got a wagon like this when i was really small . now i am 14 and istill use it for getting grocries from the store . it is still in good condition except it is rusty because i used to fill it with water nd make my friends ride in it . it is fun to ride down the hill from the store too my home . it can go really fast and it 's easy to steer . you have to be careful if you cross the road and go onto a curb with kids in it . one time my mom was pulling me and my sister to the store . when she went over the curb it tipped over and my sister scraped underneath her nose . it is a great toy and even though i 'm too old for it i still like it a lot
0	long story short . bought for daughter for christmas ... it is in the trash ... this was the worst toy/doll purchase ever
1	this is an extremely fun and addictive game . you shuffle the cards , and place three ( room , weapon , person ) in the secret envelope . in every room you go into , you can make accusations . if someone has the card you accused ( like the room ) , then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad . the game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . the character pieces have teeny details , like mr. green has straps and buckles on his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really think . oh , and good problem-solving skills too . and coordination ( you have to add all the clues up to see who did it ) . all in all , a terrific game . great for rainy days or playdates . and did i mention the weapons ? very realistic . and cute
0	this toy is a ripoff for 1/2 yr. olds and you 'll get annoyed couase the games are sooooooooooo hard even for me a 12 year old and in stead you should try out this game its an internet game its better than fat tamagotchi and if you drop the tmagotchi in water it dies 4evr 4evr and evr forever do you hear me ! ! ! ! ! go to [ ... ] you wont regret it ! ! or you can laugh at me i dont car
0	this one is rather small and does n't really look or feel like the rest . not as durable feeling as the others
0	this paint brush globs out the paint , does n't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint . we went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it . not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you ca n't get the brush in it to suck the paint up . i am so disappointed
1	this is one of the most fun games i 've every played . there are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question . i find the questions ( and answers ) are quite educational too , i 've learned a lot from these questions . a group of family members played at christmas ( 6 of us ) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question ( a bluff ) . we even let our 5 year old nephew `` play '' and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs . try it , it is loads of fun . i recommend a group of at least 4 though
1	i purchased the 12-prank kit for my 83 year old aunt this past christmas . on christmas morning , as everyone opened the usual boring gifts of knit sweaters and scented candles , my elderly aunt carefully tore open her prank kit . it was an instant hit ! as she laid out her fake dog poop on the floor next to the christmas tree and blew her new fart whistle , everyone started to roll with laughter . oddly enough , this inexpensive little gift became the high-point of our family christmas gift-giving . maybe that sounds pathetic , but my aunt was carried back to younger days when she used to pull pranks with whoopie cushions on her little nephews . thanks to this great little package , we all laughed so hard it hurt . what an awesome gift
0	i read all the negative reviews on this table and decided to go ahead and order hoping i would get lucky and not have all the problems the other customers had . do n't do it ! the table arrived poorly packaged and beat up just as the others here have described . one corner of the table top was bashed in , another piece of wood was split , the green paint from the table top rubbed off onto the white table leg , and edge of the other table leg was dented in revealing the plywood underneath the paint . this is a very cheap table - cheaply constructed of plywood . it is functional , but just not very attractive since it arrives already damaged . just beware before you buy that you will more than likely be getting a banged up train table
1	my two daughters ( two and four ) got this for christmas from `` santa '' , after seeing this , they no longer had any interest in any other gift . they love it and spend hours on in fixing each others hair
0	ummm ... i am a huge fan of bratz , but this piece of junk is absolutely terrible . first of all , the eyes are super ugly . i ca n't believe they would make such an ugly product ! the lips are fine . but i could reconsider by making better , cuter eyes ! they broke when i had it after five minutes . they do not blink . they try to , but do n't succeed . do not buy ! ! second , the features are horrible . they are made so bad , i tried to make it walk since it could n't on it 's won ! it does not walk . note that . also , it 's head does not move . it was broken on mine and it made it fall down and the neck , while trying to move , muffled the song . also , unless you wan na hear the same 20 second `` bratz catz '' song over and over again , do not buy this product . it will dissapoint your daughter like it did to me . i am the daughter , but am very dissapointed . i have returned mine and did not get a new one , either . i got some bratz babyz which were cuter than this junk ! i am warning you , this cat is brainwashed and should not be continued . do not buy this product unless you want a crying daughter for it ! ! ! thank you for your patience and gratuity in reading this grievance . love , brownie , baby doll lover . get babies instead , they 're cute !
0	i misunderstood the dimensions listed ( 7.5 x 1.5 x 10.5 inches ) and thought it would be large enough for my mother to see and handle . it is n't . apparently , the dimensions include the packaging . she loves wheel of fortune on tv , and i thought this game would be terrific therapy for her hands . very disappointing . i 'll be returning it , unopened .
0	we bought this for our 3 year old daughter for christmas . we turned it on right away and she was very excited until the sound suddenly started to fade out . we thought it was just a case of dead batteries , so we replaced the batteries - several times - until we realized the product was just bad . when trying to get it replaced , we were told they were out of stock and our money would be refunded instead . needless to say , our daughter was very sad and we will not be buying this product anywhere , ever . we 'll just stick with another type of keyboard to help our daughter develop a love of music
0	i bought these skates for my almost 3 yr old who wants to be like her big sister . the skates are good overall . they are easy enough to put on and take off . the padding inside is nice . the only drawback i can find is the the adjustment lever that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting 1 changes by itself to setting 2 which lets the wheels roll . i am not sure if i just got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of skates . i will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have to keep putting them on the correct setting .
1	the game of memory is a great equalizer because little children are just as apt to remember where they saw the hidden images as older children or adults . this makes it great game for the whole family to play together . the images from the `` i spy '' book illustrations are bright and creative . they do n't match exactly- for instance , there might be two images of cats , but borrowed from different photographs in the i spy books . so there is a bit more visual variety to spice things up . this is a much more attractive memory game than most , and would make an ideal gift for a child or family
0	this is a very fun toy . there are numerous buttons and sounds that my children enjoyed very much . after you close the phone , it rings a couple seconds later , and the kids loved to answer it and pretend to talk to people . unfortunately the two i bought quit working within a short time of buying them . i bought the first one last year for my son , and it lasted for about a week . first the recording feature stopped working . then none of the sounds worked . new batteries did n't help , i even opened it up to see if any transistors had burned out or there were any shorts . did n't find any problems ... it just refused to work . we bought a second one for christmas 06 , and it 's already quit too . we 'll try to stay away from this brand
0	the barbie plug and play 12 dancing princesses thing is a joke . my daughter only wanted that for christmas for three months . after the one on christmas morning did not function at all , the second one was so terrible that she gave up after two days . the graphics are straight from 1981 and the `` dancing princesses '' even make roboty bendy noises as they move . very strange and disappointing
1	after i read the reviews on this toy , i wanted to cancel my order . thankfully i did n't because my kids love it . i have two boys 5 9 and they love bowling with this toy . my kids have played with it since we got it in feburary . in the reviews , people said the toy broke soon after playing with it . my kids play with it all the time and we have not had any problems . everything still works great ; the pins , the sound , and the ball return .
0	this was a real let down for my daughter . she loves horses and has several breyer horses . when we saw this paddock she was so excited about it . we decided to get it for her for christmas . it is very flimsy , does not stay together and breaks easily . she spent more time trying to fix it than actually playing with it . after a couple of weeks it was just completely not worth the effort and we put it up but later threw it away , only the doll and horses were salvagable
0	the kid who wrote the 5 star reveiw is wrong . he needs to go to preschool . first , the pagages arent free , if they didnt come w/the maker no one would buy it . second , this kid says it cant get any better , but it cant get any worse ! ! ! ! the 1 star reveiws say to go to mc donalds if you want a mc flurry , but dont go there and support them thats just what they want you to do so they can earn more money ! ! go to dq or just make one yourself . do not waste your money on this peice of junk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	my sister said her 3yo son loved and and was able to play in it with his 1yo brother ! i do n't really know how durable it is , she lives in another state but said they liked it alot
1	i have two boys , 10 and 12 . the younger one bought a webkinz first and after seeing how much fun he had at the website , the older one asked for one for his birthday . the website is very kid friendly . you wo n't have to worry about what they will see on this website . it is great fun , and even i play on it ! i highly recommend this for any age child
0	i had searched high and low via the internet trying to find the perfect baby doll pram . good quality material , well made and if possible fold away storage ability . when i found the corolle pram /carriage i thought i found it plus the added bonus of a adjustable handle so no matter how tall my grand daughter was she could push her babies . but when it arrived i was not thrilled . what looked good on paper was not so in life . true it folds away to store in a closet no problem . but this ability is to easy and i fear the child will pinch her fingers . all that keeps the stroller in an up right position in 2 lame flip over metal rings . now with the wonderful way a simple umbrella stroller for a real baby folds way , why was n't this technology used on this product . sure an adult would have to fold it up , but i would feel better if that was the case then a 4 year old maybe getting broken fingers . also the cute canopy . it does not stay on if you even move it to open a tiny bit . i spent $ 113.00 on this item thinking i was getting a well put together item that would last years for my grand daughter . only way that will happen is if i can weld parts together and forget about ever wanting to store it . i did not buy this from amazon only cause i wanted it right away and so bought it from another shop . but i knew amazon would have this forum and wanted to make sure others did not waste their money on this product . go with the other one for $ 33 at least maybe it will stay together . now i have to hope i can return this thing to where i bought it . but i think corolle should either rethink this items design or just pull it from the stores . it 's not what a good parent would want for their child . thanks i hoped this helped
1	i have been wanted a non-electronic non-paper sudoku game for some time . rubik 's sudoku is a self contained single player game board . i can move it from room to room without the playing pieces moving from where i have placed them on the board . there is one extra piece for each number/color tile included . with the color coding it is easy to learn the strategy behind sudoku . i was not picking it up very fast when i tried the paper versions . after i progress through the 100 puzzles included with this game i 'll use the game board and pieces with the sudoku magazine i have . for the cost i would recommend this over the more expensive wood versions . if cost is not an issue then you might go for one of the more durable all wood versions that amazon has
1	we bought this and the sing along favorites and my 5 year old loves them both . she would n't have know many songs on the other rom packs . this is definitely a hit for the younger ones !
1	i bought this high chair for my daughter 's second birthday because i love the look of it . the similar chair made by badger basket toys gets terrible reviews for being poorly constructed so i went with this one despite it having no reviews . i could n't be happier . this high chair is solidly built and was easy to assemble . i love the white finish because it will be relatively neutral as my daughter 's room may go through decorative changes in the coming years . i do n't forsee her outgrowing this toy for quite a few years and it is sturdy enough to last . she has several dolls , the largest being her 17 '' corolle lila , who fits beautifully in the chair . i would guess that this chair could possibly handle up to a 20 '' doll . while it is solidly built , i am obviously discouraging my daughter from sitting in the chair herself ( i 've caught her trying to several times ) because no doll chair should be expected to be that sturdy ! the only real negative is the joke of a chair pad . i actually just tossed it because it does n't really add to the toy 's play value anyway and would probably just be a nuisance . i highly recommend this high chair for the child in your life who enjoys taking care of babies . it 's made me look to kidkraft for more toys and doll furniture
1	if you 're not sure if your little one will really be `` into '' these train sets , this one is a great one to try out . it 's more fun when you get all the extra buildings , but if it 's an iffy situation , then i highly recommend this set . we bought this set for our little one because he just was n't too sure about these trains . however , after he received it , he found out that he liked them and well , now we have a bunch of them ! the $ 40 is not much to invest n a toy that they 're not going to play with either ! i just wish this set had more things with it besides just the track and the train . however , you can get a little better deal if you buy the track separately from maxim , who makes brio trains now , and the train separately as well . this train will chew up the batteries pretty quickly unless you use duracell . energizer only makes it two days in this train but duracell makes it two-and-a-half weeks . other than that , highly recommend this toy
0	we have two new power wheels 12 volt batteries . they take a charge just fine with the charger that came with them . i bought this so we could use it as a rapid charger and it would take less time for the batteries to charge . i plugged them in and waited a few seconds . both batteries had the flashing red indicating the batteries were either a wrong battery or bad . this will not charge the batteries for me . all it does is sit there and blink red . but the batteries charge just fine with the original charger . how can they be bad batteries if they hold a charge and we get hours of play out of them on a full charge . funny that . makes me wonder if it is a marketing ploy for people to run right out and buy a new $ 50 battery to replace the `` bad '' one . if it would actually work to charge the battery then it would be great . but we can not get past the red light with ours . it is going right back to the store ! ! ! it might be slower but we will stick with our original charger from now on .
0	first of all i think the concept is great however the safety bobber does n't open and after about a dozen casts the reel fell apart . if you 're looking for something that shoots , buy a rocket rocket not this rocket fishing rod and save some money . shame on you roland martin for sponsoring such a piece of garbage . do n't expect to catch fish with this it is simply a novelty item
1	this little toy is cute . my 11 month old son loves blues clues and loves this toy . he will hold him on his lap while he watches his favorite show ! its really cute
0	my son loves cars and trucks so this looked like it would be a big hit , but like the other reviewers , we have had to put this toy away because of all the injuries . he used the handle to push it , but the toy is unbalanced , so any pressure on the back causes it to flip up and hit him in the face . he 's had several big bruises and one cut lip . since posting this , i 've spoken to a rep for little tykes . she said they would look into this toy a bit more and sent a replacement toy for my son to play with until he is able ( if ever ) to use the dump truck again . if you 've had a problem with this truck , please call them so that they can get it on record
1	i love the upstairs . it is so fun . because it has an upstairs , you can move up a level twice as fast . it is more fun to play when you also have the love 2 shop malls . ( quoted from my 10 year old daughter
0	this item is really small . i did n't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item . in hindsight , i would n't have order it had i paid more attention . i think the other products from haba ( eggs and teabags ) are worth the money for the size .
1	we bought two sets of the alphabet foam play mats - so glad we did ! we have a concrete basement floor , and now the kids have a nice , colorful , and soft place to play . plus , the foam floor is n't as cold as the concrete - wer 're in colorado . the colors are great - so inviting . the pieces fit together perfectly , and the border gives it a finished look . great purchase ! we 'll probably buy more so that we can increase the size of the play area !
1	i bought this for my son 's second christmas ; he was almost 2 . it was a recommendation of one of my parenting magazines and i had to hunt it down 3 years ago . he loved pounding the balls and he even could match the color of the ball to the color of the hole ! he still plays with it and i will be buying his baby brother one when he 's big enough
0	my 3 boys ( ages 4 , 7 and 9 ) love their lightsabers so the idea of a spring activated version was too hard to pass up . imagine the disappointment when the fragile spring/force action is only good for about 3 tries and then it falls apart with no way to get inside and fix it . we have 3 of them ( darth vader , obi-wan and luke skywalker ) . vader was done before 9am christmas morning . the other two are hanging on by a thread and now the boys have to be `` very gentle '' when they load the saber . the worst part is that the light up feature is tied to the spring so it does nothing now . these are not rough kids and it 's just a matter of time before the other springs get jammed . stick with the original light up sabers and forget the force action .
1	this puzzle is a lot of fun and my son loves it . the container is a toy for itself
1	i do n't know why poor scrat got so many bad reviews . my kids absolutely love this toy . they laugh hysterically every time and they 're 4 1/2 and 7 . he does have a tendency to fall down and does n't scoot very well . but the laugh factor alone makes this well worth the money .
1	this game set it of amazing quality . every piece has so much detail it just looks good without doing anything ! the dubloons are the best part , and like others have said , make the best clinking sound when you drop a pile into your hand . this game is definately worth buying ... . if you come up with some new rules that make the game more interesting . the gameplay is very uninteresting , boring , and brainless . my wife never passes up an opportunity to tell me how boring it was , and even her younger ( 12 year old ) sister thought it was boring and had more fun playing with the pieces . my wife says i should have bought us settlers of catan instead of spending my money on this ( before we got our own set ... now we have one ) , but when i bought it i knew it would be just for the game pieces . i am brewing up some good rules to change the gameplay dramatically and make it much more interesting . she likes settlers so much.. maybe i will get some trade of spices into the game and whatnot . anyways , if you are creative and have a good idea for a ship game , then definately get this game set . it is high quality and beautiful . but , if you do n't have the interest to make your own game , then pass this one up because you would most likely love to play any other game you own before this
1	this item is sooooo cute ! garfield is dressed in his jammies and is clutching pookie in his left arm . we highly recommend ty goodnight garfield , especially if you are a garfield fan
1	puchased for my grandoughter who is 5 years old . she liked very much playing the puzzle . only thing we didnot like the quality of side parts gone bad very quickly .
1	when my 25 year old daughter sat down to play wedgits with her younger siblings , she declared that she wanted a set for christmas . she thinks it will be a great coffee table game for all her college friends . my friend got a set for her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and son-in- law monopolize them with their little competitions . these are wonderful for the imagination , and with wedgits you will have a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the children very happy
0	i ordered the ants in december ( christmas present ) , and although the temperatures were unseasonably warm here throughout january , no ants arrived . i have called several times , with the same excuse . they have my money and wo n't deliver the ants . i would suggest any other company besides uncle milton industries
1	i ca n't believe how well made this set is . i have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my daughter for christmas . i wanted something sturdy and not plastic . i just received my order today and these items are great ! my son opened the box and tested them for his little sister and he ca n't wait to play with them with her . i ordered this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood and are extremely durable . i am very impressed and wish amazon carried the matching coffee pot and blender ! i also had a problem with the velcro on the butter . it was an easy fix with some super glue . i think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come off
1	great ! ! ! it is the perfect place to store all those wooden puzzles we all have for our toddlers ! the puzzles slide right in on the small metal rods ... very easy to remove puzzles ! i also like the fact that is made of a lovely natural wood ! we have this in our living room , and it is quite attractive
1	i bought this game based on the reviews on amazon and i am not disappointed . even my three year old enjoys this game and is capable of understanding the concept . the beginner puzzles are right up his alley and the expert puzzles are challenging enough for me .
0	i purchased this item as a christmas gift . on the day after christmas , i helped my son assemble this product . it worked flawlessly for the first day . the next day , i turned it on to show the boys ' grandmother . apparently , the steel ball `` wheels '' under the `` riders '' do n't roll very well after initial use . the riders would be hoisted to the top , but would fail to slide onto one of the chutes . if they did make it onto a chute , they would sometimes fail to glide all the way to the bottom , or would fall off the chute . the failure rate went from 0 % when first used to about 90 % after the first day . i 've purchased other k'nex items before and never had a problem
1	i say that because the paint on these cars chips very easily . the hamm car was already chipped sealed in the package . my son 's matchbox cars , which get tossed into their basket quite regularly , do n't seem to chip near as easy as the cars ones do . never-the-less , kids do n't care . though , my son ( who is only 3-1/2 ) is wondering why they did n't make a red ramone or the announcer cars ( bob and darryl ) ? ? also , for collectors , the sarge and fillmore are shown on the back of the card as being sold as individual items , but on the back of the hamm card , they are not shown . i have as of yet see them sold individually on the supercharged card
0	i bought 8 sets of these mats to completely cover my son 's playroom . of the 8 , there were 6 perfect sets . the other 2 had very rough sections that caused major irritation on my son 's knees . when i contacted the company , they gave me a very hard time about the issue and basically said they wouldnt do anything about replacing those mats until they received them back and could do an investigation as to how this could have happened . they kept saying that they had never seen anything like this before as though i was making the issue up . in the end , i was so unhappy with their attitude that i returned all 8 sets and went with another brand . be careful and check the quality of the sets that you receive !
0	my son ( now 4 ) loves cars , so when i saw this bed frame , i thought this is it ! well , looks can fool you . i also read many glowing reviews about this bed frame , so i was confident that this was a must buy . but after using it for a while ( 1 year now ) , i am very disappointed . if i would buy another bed frame , this one would not be in my shopping list . what i and all my family do n't like about this frame : 1 . the front end of the car frame is shaped like a sports car , so people hit that protruding part all the time when walking in the room , making people falter sometimes . 2 . since it is made of plastic , it gets really cold , and it really feels terrible . i do n't know why it is damn cold all the time . 3 . i had to exchange the regular-height box spring for a half-height one , because the regular-height box spring would be too high and the sides of the bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling . 4 . so many toys and things fall between the mattress and the bed frame . i have to lift the damn mattress and then go into the car frame to pick up all the junk that my son loves to shove into the little openings . 5 . i think the bed frame takes up way too much space for a twin sized bed . it is waste of space . 6 . my son was disappointed that the wheels do n't spin . and i think he has a point , since this bed frame costs so much . my son now do n't even think it 's a cool thing . well , he stopped liking the bed only after a few days . 7 . the head part of the bed is also plastic , and for some reason , your head can go under that plastic , because that head part comes over the mattress . it is quite annoying , and we had to put another pillow to cover that part of the frame . and you ca n't even use it as a shelf since it is not flat . dolls and little toys that we put up there would slide down to hit our son or slide to the sides and fall into the corner where there is a big opening between the walls and the car frame . 8 . again , it is very very cold , and it really feels terrible when you want to sleep at night and everything around you is so cold and hard . this is a miserable bed , and i feel bad that i bought this horrible bed for my loving son . we are gon na sell it for 100 dollars ( we hope ) in the summer . the only reason for giving 2 stars is because , it is very solid
1	sooo cute . santa gave my 7 y.o . daughter the dog and cat versions of this game . she and i have already spent several hours playing with her `` pets '' . unlike the earlier pets , there is more to do than just care for your pet . there are games , activities and interactions with pet friends . there is a whole village of homes and places to visit . you collect stickers throughout your adventures . for instance there are 29 stickers available for making friends . it is represented by a heart sticker . everytime you collect a sticker , you are taken to your sticker book and it indicates how many stickers are available and how many you have obtained . there are three exterior buttons for use to play with , groom and feed your pet . when your pet ignores you , it means it is time for grooming , playing or eating . sometimes your pet will suddenly disappear and then reappear at their potty mat having left a little undesirable . my daughter thinks that is hilarious . kids ! the only drawback is that the screen does not light up for play while travelling after dark . maybe they 'll improve upon that in the next versions
1	balderdash is a riot ! it keeps my family in stitches ! my entire family is so full of bull we play this easily . playing balderdash is a family tradition after thanksgiving christmas dinners and everything in-between . anytime there is a family gathering the balderdash game comes out ! my grown sons and their wives are full of bull , the grandkids are now joining in , but , it 's tough to out bull the mother of bulls ! got ta love it ! jan
1	it was impossible to find baby sunglasses in the winter until i found these stunning red infant shades . a plus was there is a soft strap to keep the sunglasses on . our granddaughter looks like a movie star
0	the description did n't say that the board game was sold separately . i assumed a `` game pack '' had all the necessary materials . it should hae said expansion pack . it did n't , so i had to go buy the original game . it should n't be called wb 50th anniversary , it should be called `` scene it - friends version . '' we played one full round with 2 teams and literally half of the questions had to do with the friends tv show . all in all , i was very disappointed with this product .
0	i purchased this for my sons birthday this year . he is three . he was so excited to have the play tent but when i took it out of the box and started to put it together i noticed the stitching was not straight and missing in some places . it took him no more than 24 hours to brake it . the plastic supports and cheap fabric were horrible . there was also a center support pole with no place to put it . he likes it but the quality craftmanship was a zero .
1	first i have to say thank you to amazon for having this game . this was on my daughter 's christmas list and amazon was the only place i could find it . second , my daughter loves this game and so do her friends . they have played the game more than any other she received
1	this product is not the best ever created , as the roxxi doll that comes with it is not the prettiest of bratz dolls . she has huge black and red streaks in her hair , as well as an oddly-shaped head . however , one gets used to her and can even find her pretty . the stage itself is a great product , but plugging it in to your stereo is more confusing than you might think . this playset comes with a microphone that is different from the regular rock angelz microphone , as it is gray and of a different style . also included is a faux-snakeskin chair , roxxi , a guitar , and a few accessories , like bottled water and make up compacts . the stage itself is rather nice , and i strongly suggest the instrumentz if you buy this . however , be warned that it is not the best of bratz products , despite its appeal . it 's rather nice , though . :
1	great idea to hang clothes . the hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on . if your child is like mine who loves to dress and re-dress dolls , the armoire is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits . the price is great now . i paid $ 20 . great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer .
0	i purchased this for my eight year old niece . we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks . be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer . the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive
0	3 of my friends ' sons have had this tractor . all 3 have complained of the tires popping right off , exposing the wire that connects the 2 together . i figured maybe it was because they bought them from another retailer or something , maybe rough housing ? though our sons are 2 , they 're truly not rough with these much cherished cars toys ! : ) anyway , bought mine from the disney store for [ ... ] 2 days later , after watching my son simply watch the movie w/the tractor , play randomly w/it- nothing crazy- the tire popped right off . thank god i noticed before my other son , who is 15 months old ! good luck with this one- i 'm on my way to write the company on this disastrous dangerous product- do n't purchase is my advice , unless you want a sort of rental toy ( it will break within days
0	i had high hopes for this game , but played it with a friend last night and was appalled at the number of confusing questions and just plain incorrect answers . for example , one question asks , `` which of these animals is not found exclusively in south america : ( a ) chinchilla , ( b ) sloth , ( c ) guinea pig , ( d ) spring buck '' . ruling out zoos , my friend reasoned that since zillions of kids in the us have pet guinea pigs , the answer must be c. alas , no ; the correct answer is `` ( d ) spring buck '' with no explanation . did they mean animals in their natural habitat ? we are n't sure . the question is not clearly written . another question asks , `` the word `berserk ' is derived from : ( a ) a norse god ; ( b ) the german for `crazy life ' , ( c ) a tropical plant '' . i read this to my friend and said , `` none of these is the right answer . '' the word `berserk ' comes from the germanic branch of the language tree and means `bear-shirt ' . the game says the correct answer is `` a norse god . in norse mythology , the god `berserker ' always fought in a state of frenzy . '' there is no such norse god . who wrote these questions ? one of the aspects of trivia games that i enjoy is the prospect of learning something in the process of playing ; this game concerns me because i do not know which answers are incorrect . from a learning standpoint , the badly written questions and poorly researched answers make this a frustrating and intellectually dangerous game .
0	pros : very cool toy/model for a 12+ with extra time on their hands . cons : too many microscopic pieces to count . very little room for open play . requires extreme caution playing with it because the propeller and other pieces fall apart at the slightest breath . not appropriate for under 7 , at least . first just let me say that my son loves the lego duplo blocks and spends hours creating all kinds of different designs with them . he has been begging for the `` big boy '' legos , and i have been turning him down , pointing out the recommended ages on the box , ( knowing that i would be picking up infinite numbers of tiny pieces throughout the house for the next 18+ years ) . the ages they put on the box seem to be purely arbitrary , based on this particular toy . a well-meaning relative decided to bless him with this present on his 5th birthday . ( i will be seeking revenge as soon as they have children . ) i spent the next several hours constructing this nightmare , which in and of itself defeats the purpose of a building toy , in my opinion . i have no idea where they have the idea that this is appropriate for a 5-year-old , given that it was a challenge for me to put this together . given the amount of microscopic pieces in this toy , one has to wonder who designs these things and if they have children of their own . so much of it seems purely sadistic . when the helicopter was finally assembled ( and i warned him that that was the one and only time i was putting it together ) , my son spent some time playing with it , only to be constantly frustrated by the fact that pieces were constantly popping off , particularly the propeller , and this was with very gentle play . bottom line , if you have a child under 10 , they would probably have many more hours of play if you just bought a lot of inexpensively priced lego blocks ( of various types ) that they could make into all kinds of different designs . these expensively priced city lines and the like are really neat once built , but then it 's just like a very fragile model . once you 've spent the time constructing it , you really do n't want to take it apart , so i 'm not really sure why you would buy this over a traditional model . i guess i miss the point .
1	my 8 year old son loves this toy . he has spent many hours acting out the cartoon and loves that fact that the cape pops out at the push of a button and winds back in by moving a leg back and forth . he likes the food dish that shoots the disc . and also thinks the cryptonite is cool ! ! ! it says it changes colors when warm , but we havent seen that . maybe nn to run it under hot/cold water ? ! overall a fantastic buy
0	we bought this item for my daughter 's christmas present and the strings do not work at all . all it does is play the 3 songs , and the microphone works . but the other functions ( anything to do with the strings ) do not work at all . we bought this at toys r us and we 're taking it back tomorrow . as i can see from the reviews ( which i wish i 'd read earlier ) , we 'll be getting a different brand of guitar . these seem faulty as a rule . do not buy this
0	as others have stated the dvd mini-games are nearly impossible to play due to wonky controls . i also have no idea what the cards or pieces are for , other then they may come into play if you `` win '' the main game . they should have just done a choose your own adventure type game . it would have been less high-tech , but you could at least have a laugh when you choose `` set up a perimeter '' and the terrorists once again escape . do not buy
1	i like that everything fits in the case . my 2 year old enjoys dumping all the pieces on the floor . no big deal . you can also store a few parts in the potato and take it with you . very happy with purchase
1	this was the best stocking stuffer ever . and we got 4 . one for each of us . mine is know at my office , and my boss loves it
1	we use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1- and 2-year old children . it 's intended for children a little older , and i can see why , as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps . however , my 2-year-old can use it by herself , and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys . i had to hold it in place for my 1-year-old , but when doing so , it also allowed him to color . i would recommend it , especially for children 3 and up .
1	unavailable for some time , the sky high suspension bridge is back . once you have the ramps to get the track up there , it really stands out as a part of the railroad . assembly was required but routine ; the directions were quite adequate . there are no stickers to wiggle into place
0	bought this for my 6 month grandson . worked about 1 week then quit . have changed batteries but still does n't work . guess it was too good to be true ! spend your money on another crib toy
1	wonderful product . we bought this as a gift for my son 's 7th birthday as a fun incentive to get him a little writing and spelling practice . he loved to make his own books at home with computer paper and the stapler , so a real book was a huge hit . he thought this was great because it is a real bound book with his own words and pictures . his book will be a cherished keepsake and i 'm sure it will be great fun to look at when he is grown
1	well , this is the expansion for settlers of catan , and a lot of things have changed . the ability to build military forces adds depth to the game , as does the city improvements . the abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone . the expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play , but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours . my only complaint is that in several games , the barbarians have not beaten us once , they are way too easy . however , this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own . all in all , this makes a great game totally awesome
1	based on the other reviews , this grandmother decided to buy this particular playhouse for my grandson 's first birthday present ! i am not the least bit disappointed . colorful , action packed activities everywhere , sturdy , easy to assemble , cold weather friendly and perfect for the little boys in your life ! there are a lot of girlie playhouses , but this one is the answer for boys . my son put it together in about an hour , and was ready for the birthday party guests . happy grandmother
1	i purchased this as a christmas gift for my 1 year old nephew . very pleased with the online price through toys-r-us and amazon.com , it was $ 50.00 less than in a retail store ! very prompt shipping , had to be put together but not difficult with common household tools . very nice quality wagon , top of the line and well worth the money . rubber tires give a more comfortable ride for small children . i also purchased the pad set . fits perfectly , looks great nad comfy ride , but be sure to purchase the pad set for the model # 29 all-terrain cargo wagon ( bp-29 ) , as other pad sets will not fit ! very nice onverall . do n't hesitate to buy !
0	i was torn at what remote control car to buy my 4 year old son . the sales clerk at the disney store could n't say enough about this car , my son is a huge `` cars '' fan -- i was sold ! ! it never worked , it just jerked a little bit ! my 2 year olds fisher price car works a lot better for a third of the price . now i got the boys fighting over the baby car and do n't even ask for lightning mcqueen . i am going back to the store and get my money back . do not waste your time on this toy ! ! thank you .
0	it was neat to be able to make `` cotton candy '' at home , however , the machine only makes a very small amount at a time , so it is a lot of work for not much enjoyment . it takes an adult to run the machine and watch over it since it gets hot . then it cools for almost 10 minutes . it does n't even come with the sugar needed ! the product should list it on the outside of the box..sugar not included ! then you have to clean it ( adult only ) it would not buy it again.this review will not mark a 1 for educational value . it keeps giving it a 2 and i put a one ( fyi
1	i originally bought this for my husband , an emt/ff . i wrote a poor review of company , based upon my entire experience w/ this storefront , and the other items i had purchased . i was n't terribly pleased with the [ ... ] pen but my husband took it to work and loved it . said it went off several times from pocket while driving..and the entire er loved it . overall , it is fun and writes and does what it 's supposed to : make you laugh
0	why should i buy anything from amazon when they allow price gouging by third-party retailers
1	i wrote some reviews of lila doll saying she is my favorite but this one is extremly pretty . her face is so pretty and all her clothes and cute . i say diffrent , i say that lila is better than polly ! lila also comes with a cute horse and carrige . wow how can you think spending 25 dollars on polly will be better when you can spent less than 10 dollars on lila and get a real cute and worth-the-money doll
0	we tried adding the soap and turned the handlle `` really fast '' but it still dosent do much ? ?
1	we had a blast making up our on questions and playing this game . the guys played it and the guys never want to play games
1	being a preschool teacher i use these all of the time . i have found that taking the sheets out individually clipping them to the easels clip to be the best way to work with them . even if you do n't have an easel these are wonderful for children of all ages . large , unlined sheets of paper encourage children to be creative and to express themselves in a completely original way . for infants , toddlers , and preschoolers i will often tape the sheets to the table and let them color/paint/glue to their hearts delight
0	we 've had a number of gazillion bubble machines . the first - this one , with an upright rotating set of bubble wands - worked relatively well , but stopped working after maybe a dozen uses . ( granted , one of those uses was for a few hours ) . when the level of liquid is low , the machine stops making bubbles since it has to pick up enough liquid to cover the wand . we replaced it the next year with the typhoon machine - this was awesome , produced a huge quantity of bubbles and worked more reliably since the bubble liquid is sucked up and put on the wands , no matter how low the supply of liquid . it has a large reservoir at the bottom so you do n't need to fill it very often - it takes a lot of liquid though . our issue now is getting the liquid . gazillion liquid does produce the best bubbles - they last well , etc . etc . etc . however , very few stores stock the liquid , and except for when i first bought the first machine , no-one stocks large size bottles . even the online vendors like toys.com who are supposed to have them , never have them in stock ( i 've been on their notify list for a long time ! ) i 've ended up buying from someone in canada on ebay - otherwise , buying the smaller bottles at toysrus , target , etc . is just too expensive . both of these machines do n't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids ( especially the cheaper kinds in very large size bottles ) are much thinner and the liquid drips right off the wands before it has a chance to pass by the blower part to make any bubbles . we 're planning to start making our own bubble liquid and hopefully that will cover us . otherwise , the machines are useless now .
0	do n't waste your time with this thing . by the time we invested in the toy , the batteries , etc . we had quite a few dollars into it ... for about 15 minutes of fun . the toy ca n't just be set down on a table , so when my son actually gone bored with it ( to my shock because he loves bubbles ) he tried to set it down and it spilled the remaining gold solution all over . yuck . mommy promptly threw the toy in the trash . this toy is just a gimmick - stick with the good old magic bubbles and save your money
1	these blocks are so great ! they 've gone through their different stages of growth . they learned to reach for them , peek inside , grasp them , toss them around and now stacking them to make towers . my triplets are 20 mos and have had them for about a year . love them all
0	my wife and i purchased the videonow xp interactive video system for my son this christmas however when we did walmart was out of the headphones . well i was on amazon one day and decided to look here . i ordered them and was seriously disappointed when they arrived . my 5 year old son attempted to put them on and all they did was fall to his shoulders . no matter how we tried that is all they would do . my 12 year old daughter decided to try them with her mp3 player with the same result ! i am able to wear them however even with my 30 year old head ( size 8 1/4 ) it is still loose . these are not adjustable which of course makes things all the worse . i would just go ahead and pick up some other company 's aftermarket headphones for your child . if tiger reads the reviews of their products at all then they need to ensure that they rethink the engineering of this device
0	do not like this product at all ... the girls on the video are not facing the right way for easy instruction ... we have to go the opposite way ... very uncool ... my daughter started crying , too ... i told her it was n't her fault ... you want your child to feel good about themselves and all it does is make them feel like they are n't good enough ... do not waste your money
1	i bought this set for my son prior to reading the other reviews online but before i tried to set it up . i will admit in reading the reviews about how difficult some people thought it was to put together that they must be exaggerating ... we 'll apparently they were not . i tried for 10 minutes and was covered in soap and nearly hurt myself trying to get the first two pieces together ... so at that point i gave up and waited for my husbands help . the two of us spent nearly an hour banging the thing together with every tool we had ( after we washed off all the soap b/c that just made getting the pieces to stay together impossible ) and once we had the center base up i pushed it and it fell completely apart . we got it back together but there was no way i felt it was sturdy enought to let my child anywhere near it . so in desperation i called the toysrus store where i got it and spoke w/ the store manager . she assured me that this was not how it was supposed to be and that i should bring it back . i wasnt thrilled about that b/c it wasnt the easiest thing to get home in the first place ... but what choice did i have . i asked her if they would set the next one up for me to make sure it worked b/c i was n't about to go through this again . when i arrived at the store it was all set up and completely sturdy ... exactly what i had wanted it to be when i had purchased it . unfortunatly due to its size we had to take it back apart to get it home but once we did my husband had it back together in about 10-15 minutes with just a little banging from a rubber mallett ... just like some of the other reviewers had said . so the morale of the story is ... if its miserable to put together then its probably defective and should go back ... but once its together properly its great ... .now if my son would just show some interest in the darn thing all would be good with the world !
1	even though i dont have this i think is the most cutest thing i have ever seen
0	my brother , the uncle of my two sons , purchased this item for christams . in the excitement of testing this item out they realized the battery backing was not able to be opened . the screw casing was stripped ! no big deal , i thought , i would just call the company . they are not willing to replace the prodect unless i pay for shipping . they recomeded that i take it to a local store to replace knowing that it was purchased over 1000 miles away and not at a chain store ! passing the buck . i then asked to speak to a super visor and she repeated the same mantra , `` sorry company policey . '' i never go to the lengths that i am now , but i am tired of companies not performing the basic duties of customer satisfaction . they want me to go to the post office and mail it to them at which time they will determine whose fault it is and then mail me a new one . when i asked if there was any way around said policy the manager told me i could write a letter . so here it is
0	kids played it one time and have n't touched it since . bought the extra tower attachment which was a complete waste of money .
1	my 4 year old son loves all things rescue hero ! his grandparents got the macc for him almost a year ago now . i run an in home day care , so i watch not only my son but 2 other 5 year old boys and my youngest son , 13 mo and a 10 mo old boy ! they all love it ! this thing has stood up to all of their adventures ! one of the kids i watch was thrilled when he got the same macc for his birthday from his parents ! he had just went on and on about it , and they could n't resist . it is very large , but we already had the firetruck , police car , helecoptor and about 30 rescue heroes , so , in the words of my son , we just had to get this too ! i highly recommend this toy for all ages ! great imaginary play
1	i really like my first leap pad and so does my 3 year old son . i bought it for him for christmas last year ( he was 2 1/2 then ) and though some the activities we 're alittle hard for him to start with , there were still plenty of things he could do with it.every picture you touch the pen on says a frase/says the name of the object or make a sound , so even without playing the games he still had great fun with it . a year on , he can now play all the games on it and has recently noticed letters make words , so now he touches the words and the leap pad reads it for him , so he is still learning from this toy after a year ! i will be buying more my first leap pad books for him this christmas , this toy is worth every penny
1	i purchased this toy for my 2 year old son . he absolutely loves it ! he had played with it before because his older cousin has one . i had searched in stores around me wanting to buy it but no one had it . sure enough i found it on amazon . it 's a lot of fun to play with and he just loves to rock out with it . i definately recommend this toy
0	dude this looks cool but plays crappy -pretty cheap plastic , mechanics are lame . you cant really tell when superman is hit because his head barely leans back . you have to constantly adjust the arm positions of the figures so their reach can strike the head or chest targets -and it seems rigged that supermans arms are just a little longer to stack the odds for truth , justice and the american way . again , cool figures weak cheap playability
1	my daughter has trouble concentrating in school . i got this for her birthday and her grades instantly improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a noticable improvement in all areas of her work . the best thing about it is that i do n't have to tell her to use it because she loves it . i told her it 's just like having a laptop because she always wanted a computer of her own . this is as close as i 'm willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her age , plus it 's a minute fraction of the price of a personal laptop . for children who do n't have a hard time in school , this may not be for them but for my daughter it is a whole lot of what i needed to help me help her learn . i just wish i could find an adapter .
1	fun for kids age 4 -40 . bought it as a gag for my college age son ... he loved it for pranks , but also let young nieces and nephews play with it . kept them laughing for a long time .
0	i think that the new style of the people are not as nice and durable as the old ones
1	my girls were given this game a couple years ago . . .ages 2 and 3 . they crack up over the voices and play it still . i like it also b/c it 's so darn cute
0	this is the first time i 'm writing a review of anything on amazon.com , but i need to warn people about this game . it would be great except for 2 problems : 1 . it skip excessively . 2 . there is no way to easily skip past games that you 've played . so once you 've taken out that dvd , put it back in and you 'll recognize the questions -- you 've answered them already ! not recommended . if i could give it negative stars , i would . however , amazon makes you give it at least 1
1	i bought this house for my daughter who will be 3 in 2 month 's . i did a lot of research and was torn between the twin town house and this one the loving family sweet sound 's house . at first i almost went with the my first doll house by fisher price but was told by a friend she would proberly grow out of that fast and she was right . this house the sweet sound 's is a perfect size for her and i know she will get quite a few year 's out of it . yes the furniture is impossible to find . after reading the review 's i did n't look for it much knowing i would never find it . i ended up buying her the twin town 's bathroom and a few pieces from the my first doll house by fisher price . the pieces work perfect together and are chunkier for her and not so many tiny pieces . they work great with the doll 's that come with it too . i did also purchase one doll set from twin town house . the house does make some sound 's with just the pieces that come with it , they are cute and my daughter does n't know any better that it would make more if we could of found the correct sweet sounds furniture . she 's happy with the way it is . i decided against the twin town because i agreed with some reviewers after looking at it that the room 's were too tiny . yes you get more room 's but my daughter i know would get so frusterated with alway 's knocking the furniture over in those tiny room 's . this house has big room 's . it fold 's up easy in half but not so good when it is filled with furniture . we leave it open anyway 's so that is not a big deal . it was easy put together but the sticker 's took about and hour to put on . also a note make sure and put the battery in before you fill it with furniture , i put the battery in last and ended up spilling the furniture everywhere . also i did n't see any one mention the front door . i am not really sure why but it does n't open from the outside , only from the inside . you can open it from the outside but you have to pull it very hard and really are n't supose to open it that way . why not be able to open it both way 's ? ? ? i guess their thinking is so if you are moving it so the door does n't swing open but they could of put a little latch on it so you could of closed it shut when you wanted . also i am not sure what room is supose to be the bathroom . i think it is either the bedroom or above that which i thought was the kid 's playroom . i ended up putting the bathroom in the right side of the bathroom . all in all i think is is a great doll house and i would recommend it
1	this was a gift to my grand sons ( 10 7 ) . they were well pleased with it . the 10 year old has joined a chess club after school .
0	at first this case seemed like a good idea , but after the 3rd use , the zipper broke . since the case does not stay open on its own , there is tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart . after fixing it a couple of times , it is now permanently broken . bad design . maybe velcro would have been better
1	along this is not the most exhilirating toy . however , my son has collected many of the toy story toys and enjoys playing with all of them together . for any child who does this you need to have slinky do
0	this game has zero replay value . once you play the three episodes , you 're done . each run through of each episode is the same . played through the entire disc in an hour and half . my advice : spend a few dollars more and get scene it !
0	i picked this item up for my 6 year old nephew who loves science . we put it together one night and i was surprised to find that the base and volcano are incredibly thin plastic that crack under any pressure at all . the plaster/sand mixture was impossible to work with , it just balled up into clumps and there was no real way of spreading it around smoothly . we both ended up with plaster all over us . once it had dried , he was excited to get to paint it . as soon as he began to paint , parts of the plaster started breaking off in chunks . hooking the plastic tubing up was not a major problem but i had issues keeping it hooked together . the `` pump '' system was supposed to send vinegar into a baking soda chamber to push up into the volcano . instead the `` pump '' ( which was a squeeze bottle ) pushed the vinegar weakly upwards and then once it hit the baking soda chamber it clogged up . when it finally made its way out through the volcano after me squeezing the bottle as hard as possible , it barely trickled out . once it had trickled enough , the rest of the plaster fell off as it got wet . he and his sisters just looked at me and asked `` is that it ? '' after three tries we trashed the whole thing . also , the `` rock samples '' that they give you in the kit are the size of the tip of your fingernail . i 'm a geologist and these are not rare , expensive rocks . there was no reason to not include larger samples . he was very disappointed in the whole thing and so was i. i ca n't believe that the smithsonian put their name on this product . we 'll go back to our plaster volcano with vinegar and baking soda
0	my son received this as a christmas gift . he and his brother and dad were excited ... got all set up to build it ... and got nothing but frustration ! these are really mechanically minded guys too . very disappointing . i was especially surprised because of the smithsonian name on it -- you 'd think they would test this stuff before allowing their name on it . my guys never got as far as the reviewer who eventually got it assembled . the screws stripped and we did n't have the appropriate glue to even attempt a rescue . it simply would not assemble the way it was advertised . i am calling amazon tomorrow about a refund .
0	toy makes extremely loud animal noises , along with a screeching motor when backing up or at top speed going forward . my son enjoyed the heck out of it for about 2 minutes before my wife said it was going back to the store , which is exactly what i was thinking . at least 3-4x louder than any other toy i 've ever seen , let alone purchased . also when performing its `` flip '' maneuver , it gets stuck 70 % of the time and then makes the same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries to reset its `` flip arm '' . might be okay for just outside use if you can stand a lot of high pitched noise . controller was extremely toddler friendly compared to other rc toys . toy also seemed fairly tough .
1	this is really fun for adults . we get together once a month and we really enjoy the company , the food and the spirits . this was meant for adults to solicize not for children . i am sure they might learn somehting at another gathering . i have really enjoyed bunco .
0	this toys purpose is to sort your change , and it performs poorly . in mine , the quarters get stuck unless you pour coins in one by one , which takes forever . if you pour more than one coin in they get stuck or little coins fall into the slots for bigger coins . in mine the quarter got stuck in the dime slot blocking it , it no longer works
1	you know the family games that you regret buying , especially when you see your child coming at you with it on a rainy day , saying , `` will you play this with me ? '' well , rat-a-tat-cat is not one of these . it 's simple enough to learn , but there is enough challenge in it to keep even an adult guessing . rat-a-tat-cat was a gift to our family , but when my youngest daughter ( age 4 or 5 at the time ) got the hang of it , it became her favourite and here 's why : 1 ) though she was just learning numbers , she could understand the game , 2 ) the guessing part of the game put her on equal par with adults , to her delight . 3 ) even for a busy adult , it 's easy enough to sit down and play this game and actually can be relaxing . 4 ) if a guest came over , my daughter was able to explain the game rules to the guest and soon she 'd have even teenage guys sitting cross-legged on the floor trying to get rid of the rats . good ice-breaker . simply put , rats are bad , cats are good . high points ~ you do n't want them . the higher the number on the card , the more rat-power in the drawing . zero is the best , with rats gone and a cat installed as a happy statue of liberty . the drawings are whimsical clever . the reason it 's a success as a game for all ages is because though it appears simple , there is the element of not knowing what your cards are and even if you peek ( with permission ) , opponents can take your best away from you . so , if you do n't mind losing to a kid and making that kid 's day , as well as having a laugh , go ahead and get this game . my daughter is older now and we still play it . she 's also learned to be a good loser : -
0	my daughter , 6 , received this for christmas . her 4-year-old brother also wanted to play with it . the first problem is that there are no instructions included for how to put it together . this is a problem when you have two antsy kids eager to play with it . i was struggling with getting the various panels to snap together solidly when , after repeated attempts , i happened to look in the drawer underneath the colored bulbs and crayons , and found -- what do you know ! -- screws . then , after i put on the top , i realized i should have installed the light bulb first ( you need a light bulb of 25 watts or less , not included ) . then , when i thought i was done , i found i had a piece left over . arrgh ! that extra piece was a clip that is supposed to hold a picture for tracing . ha ! even after i installed it , there 's no tension on the clip and very little chance that it will hold anything . there are two drawers to hold the bulbs and crayons . good idea . but for some reason the drawers catch and stick . how hard can it be to make drawers that slide easily in and out ?
0	i thought this would be fun , but ended up in garbage after 2 days . fighters dont stay in place and dont really move well . very hard to hit at other playe
0	i would give this kit zero stars if i could . the instructions say that it takes 6-8 weeks for the seeds to sprout . i kept them in moist peat and warm temperatures for over three months after the recommended period of refrigeration . not a single seed sprouted . i finally had to throw out the whole kit when mold took over . complete waste of time and money . but if you 're feeling lucky , you should know that most of the seeds in this kit are n't much bigger than pinheads , and they all come packaged together in the same tiny plastic bag . so if you want to have each type of plant growing in a different section of the plastic tray provided in the kit - like that shown on the box cover - you need to separate out each seed under a strong magnifying glass . and even then you wo n't be successful , as most of these seeds look just like ground pepper . i accidentally spilled a few on the floor , and after sweeping them all up i literally could n't tell them from the other debris in the dustpan . by the way , it takes a minimum of 6-8 years living in ideal growing conditions for any of the plants in this kit to reach the sizes shown on the box cover . these are not plants that can simply be put on a windowsill . they need an environment that is not easily provided in the average home - lots of very bright light ( about 15 hours a day ) , lots of humidity , an acidic growth medium ( such as sphagnum moss ) , and about 80 degrees . and even then , these are very slow-growing plants . to keep the humidity level high , you 'll need some kind of terrarium , preferably covered to keep the humidity level high . but if you use incandescent bulbs to provide the necessary level of light , the amount of heat they produce can easily raise the temperature to lethal levels . for this reason i recommend a combination of fluorescent bulbs and a moist/dry heating pad at the bottom . be sure that whatever heating pad you use is n't the type that shuts off automatically after one hour of use . some warnings ... these plants flourish only in a very limited range of environments and nourishment . the care you would normally give a houseplant will - in all likelihood - kill these plants : never feed them animal protein ( like hamburger ) . the fats in meat are n't digestible and can kill them . never use tap water to water them . the mineral build-up can kill them so use distilled water only . never feed them insects that have been killed by insecticides , like raid . carnivorous plants should be fed soft-bodies insects like small slugs , ants , termites , etc. , rather than hard-shelled insects such as beetles . well-stocked pet stores will carry dried mealworms , but even these will need to be cut into very small pieces . just as a baby needs tiny mouthfuls of food , so too do venus flytraps . never fertilize them . these are very slow-growing plants and any attempt to force them to grow will kill them .
1	the build a figure ( baf ) program of marvel legends keeps on rocking . this time build a giant 14 '' apocalypse . this baf is big and cool , super articulated , with sculpt and paint fine enough to be a sculpture . for apocalypse 5 stars . for iron fist ... well he 's super articulated and does come with the mighty booty ( that 's the buttocks ) of apocalypse , but really is the weakest figure in this series . a lot of that is just charater design though . green tights with an open v-neck green shirt , and what is that tattoo supposed to be anyway , ballet slippers and a dew-rag ? pretty horrible looking . if you can , try to find the red suit variant , at least that 's a little cool . also , the accesories ( besides the booty ) are two rubbery flames to fit into his hands to give a fire fist effect . good luck with that . they are kind of flimsy and hard to place in the hands . once you get them in you better not touch the figure again or they will fall off . overall , not the quatlity of figure or accesories i 'd expect . but the rest of the figures in the series will make up for this one , plus you do still get that booty
0	complete waste of money ! i bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it ! after several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed . now the darn thing does not respond to her answers . even when i clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register . complete waste of money ! ! ! ! would not recommend to anyone ! save your money and play with a rock , much more fun
1	this was my first schleich world of knights figure , given to me christmas of this year . it 's a highly detailed classic dragon , with no moving or detachable parts ( the wings are an integral part of the figure ) . as such , it 's safe for very young children , and you do n't have to worry about someone 's eye getting put out . as to its historical accuracy and educational value , i really can not say , never having seen dragons in the wild , but the level of detail is wonderful , and it should encourage children to obtain the more `` practical '' members of the balance of scheich world of knights collection , which are excellent , as well
1	my almost 5 year old daughter loves this toy . it is easy for her to control . my 8 year old thinks it is boring . i do n't think it has any educational value . the controller has a long pointed antenna with a plastic rounded end , so the kids have to be careful not to poke each other with it .
0	bought this product for my two sons ages 4 and 6 . within the first week one of the sticks was broken . called the company and they sent out another one , but before it could arrive the other stick broke . they are n't made strong enough to use . they plastic simply cracks and totally falls apart . we ended up throwing it out
0	i am a breast cancer survivor and i find this pink dressed , blond `` doll '' of perfection rather insulting to my female self , the perfect perky boobs , the long blond hair , the body that does not exist on a woman after the ravages of chemotheraphy . i can perfectly understand mattel wanting to support breast cancer research and donate a portion of proceedes towards funding ( and thank you for your generosity ) , but to do it under the guise of selling a `` doll '' which does not reflect the community of women who have experienced the challenges of recovery and survivorship ... a doll which does not look like a survivor is literally painful and insulting ! why does n't this doll have a wig ? why does n't she have a breast removed ? why does n't she have a bra fitted with a form to mimic the shape of a breast ? what is wrong with reality ? why ca n't mattel acknowledge the true nature of this disease and make a doll which comforts , not insults the sensibility of women who have suffered from this disease . i will purchase this doll , just because i am horrified by the product itself . i will disrobe her , and with a saw , cut off her breast so that she will look more like me , a survivor , a woman of pride . i will dismantle the construct of supposed beauty and make this image more like my own - because i am what is woman , not the facade of a false construction .
0	my 3-year-old son liked floam because of the goop factor , but unfortunately the goop the little foam pellets are suspended in seems to be a great medium for growing mold . this happened to us twice ( despite clean hands/work space ) so we gave up on it entirely . i suggest you try playfoam instead . it 's also available here on amazon , or at lakeshore learning store ( look for samples at the checkout for 49 cents ! ) playfoam has a nicer consistency , less sticky ( but still moldable ) and no odor
1	this doll is absolutely breathtaking . i bought her for my `` gift closet '' , but i think i 'll keep her for myself ! the price was only $ 5.29 during the special toys r us sale , plus free shipping . could n't ask for a better deal or a prettier collectible doll
1	in boggle , players compete against one another and a 3-minute hourglass to find word combinations across randomly distibuted letter cubes on a 4x4 grid . the game develops pattern recognition skills , and because most possible words are only three or four letters long , astute younger players can play adults without too much of s handicap . tactics learned playing boggle translate well into success at scrabble and other word games , while the clock management skills help with chess and test taking . boggle is lightweight and makes a good travel game , though you might want to bring a zipper-lock sandwich bag to avoid losing the letter cubes . as an added plus , the game can be played solitaire with minimal dropoff in entertainment value . if you enjoy boggle , you might want to seek out big boggle , which uses a 5-by-5 grid ( 56 % more cubes ) . words and time limit are both longer .
0	my friend got this toy for me saying it was the best , and because i 'm a dancer . when i opened it , the doll 's head fell off and when i dropped it , it broke . i suggest instead going to a real studio , because this was a waste of my friends money .
1	i chose this railway set over learning curve because i believe their prices are inflated , and i was not disappointed with it . the set is well made overall , with smooth , well-fitting track and sturdy accessories . my son ( 3 ) and daughter ( 6 ) have played with the set for hours every day since we got it , both with equal fascination . it fits perfectly with thomas accessories we already own . i have only three small caveats : 1 ) buy some `` sure track '' clips to use on elevated portions of the track . we use it on a smooth , level surface ( hardwood floor ) , but the clips really enhance the stability for active play . 2 ) the round turntable did not spin freely when we got it , because the blue center piece was not perfectly round . we drilled out the rivet and removed the blue center piece , sanded down the edges , and replaced it . now it 's very easy for my kids to operate . 3 ) the trains included have slightly wobbly wheels , compared to thomas trains . but they are functional , and my kids use the trains interchangeably . it 's a great set , and a real bargain
0	i bought this for my nine year old daughter . the game in theory is great , but ours does not work right , and the company is not real great to deal with . i am still trying to get a replacement . if the game worked properly , i would rate it 5 stars , easily . even my thirteen year old daughter loves it
0	while the doll is beautiful , i do n't think she is a good representation of chinese people because if you look at the picture of a close up of her face , you can see that her eyes are big and round just like a european . her nose also is upturned . while some may say that some asians do have rounder eyes , most do not and i do n't think this doll looks chinese enough
0	i bought her because martina mcbride is my favorite singer and then my lil sis gotm madded and she chopped of the head ~7 year old
0	my daughter ( 3 at the time ) received this as a christmas present and it took her all of 10 minutes to memorize where the pieces belong thus ending the usefulness of the game . the game itself only comes with 12 puzzle pairs ( 24 total pieces ) . i would avoid this game entirely .
1	when it first came out almost 20 years ago , i saw this game at a bookstore and bought it to take on a christmas skiing vacation with my family . unfortunately , my mother ended up having emergency gallbladder surgery instead . we did n't have gifts that year , but we did made it to colorado and spent hours by the fire laughing until our ribs ached playing this crazy game . it does n't matter if you can draw , it 's how fast you can put something down that halfway suggests the word they give you , and how ridiculous everyone 's scribblings usually look . i 've played it with an artist . he could n't even draw a nose and chin in the 20 seconds he had , so his artistic standards took a dramatic tumble . if my spirits need a boost , i play this game . buy it . you 'll love it
1	at first it was confusing but after you get it , it is sooo much fun . and it 's great for keeping your brothers out of the room
0	back in the day ( 1970 's ) these were made with a stiff , strong plastic , rigid `` insert '' w/ the poly-rope outside . this gave the `` leash '' a realistic , `` tight but curved under own weight '' appearance , a believable / realistic `` bounce '' to the `` dog '' with the most imperceptible wrist action on the part of the `` dog walker '' . however , this piece of crap has a thick soft wire inside the leash , and this gives the leash a very phony , fake-looking , too-heavy , all bent-up look . piece of junk piece of junk piece of junk !
1	if you are a hardcore family guy fan like me ( i am actually one of the few people that watched family guy when it was originally on the air ) , you will not be disappointed with this monopoly version . the box is beautifully designed with the griffin family pictured on center , and some easter eggs to look around for . the board is not the most impressive one especially compared to the simpson 's and muppets monopoly versions but it is pretty nice with the griffins at center . what you will love of the board is the properties , which include everything from chris ' closet and seamus ' lighthouse to james woods high and geronimo 's palace to the clam and channel 5 news to mayor west 's mansion and finally petoria , all from both old and new seasons plus some scenes from the stewie 's untold story movie . the property deeds are somewhat disappointing though . the do not have color watermarks like those found in the simpson 's version , but i guess they will do . peter 's fishing boat , hinden-peter , peter-copter and the pope mobile replace the railroads . i bet you will not be laughing too much when you have to pay $ 200.00 ( income tax ) for volcano insurance or $ 75.00 for workplace sensitivity training ( luxury tax ) but hey , you ca n't stay mad for long at the salesman guy , right ? it would have been cool to have joe swanson on the go to jail space and have a picture of quahog prison on the jail space but well , what can you do ? the pewter tokens are nice . you can chose from tv junkie peter , mug in hand brian , nose picking chris , lois , stewie in a high chair and meg ( who looks like a peanut character ) . you can also order four more tokens that include the giant chicken , quagmire , joe and the evil monkey . the coolest changes are the chance and community chest cards that are replaced by the what the deuce ! and giggity ! giggity ! giggity ! cards , respectively . they are beautifully done in full color and you will find things like ; made sheriff of bumblescum advance to go , get liposuction and implants pay $ 100 , confederate civil war veterans are after you go back 3 spaces , take big fat paulie to the movies as a favor collect $ 25.00 , help death get a girlfriend collect $ 100 , and many more . the money goes as follows $ 1 - meg , $ 5 - chris $ 10 - lois , $ 20 - brian , $ 50 - stewie , $ 100 - peter , $ 500 - the griffins there are no special rules for this version , which is weird since it has been the norm for some time in these special monopoly versions . to wrap it up i must say that even though they could have done a better job this is a beautiful and wonderfully done monopoly game . family guy fans will love it making this a great gift . have fun
0	i was also discouraged by the reviews but bought it anyway . it was a lot of fun ! while it worked . we experienced the same symptoms as the other reviewers here ... i appreciate the info on how to fix it but should we have to ? it 's too bad because it really is a cute toy and my 2 year old loved it . i would not buy it again . if you are considering purchasing this toy make sure the company has fixed it first
1	as always a pleaser ! my girls , ages 9 , 8 and 2 have about 8 other sweet streets . they play for hours with them . i also bought her the shopping district and movie theater . they got a big kick out of the music the movie theater played . i would highly recommend sweet streets village gift set and all the other sweet street products ! ! ! !
0	i bought this for my 4 year old grandson for christmas . we opened it up and sat on the floor and began putting it together . he was excited because he is a lighting mcqueen fan . he got about four pieces of it together and got very frustrated . it would not stay together . the puzzle is junk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the pieces are not flat and do not interlock so that they stay together . he lost interest and left . i finished it enough so that they were laying together to see the picture - which is very cute . but , no way would they ever all fit together . do not waste your money on this . i also had to retape the corners of the box , as they were all coming apart too . yea for cheap imports . the usa is so much better off for them ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
0	was a lot smaller than i expected . my daughter had to find a small doll to use that would fit . because she could n't use her best baby doll that she loves to play with she lost interest real quick
1	i bought this for my grandson for christmas , he was 8 months old . this has been the best learning toy for him , along with entertainment . he has learned how the shapes work and took this on soon . it has also helped him in walking . it is entertaining for me to watch him play with this toy , he has to push the button and play the music before he pushes it . i would actually buy one more for him to have at home with mom and dad . this is well worth the money
1	there are so many great things about this that i do n't know where to start . availability -- price -- shipping -- the list goes on and on . bottom line is that my daughter is a big care bear fan and it 's impossible to find this bear anywhere else . it arrived quickly , was just as described ( in fact it was softer ) and occupies a place of honor on my daughter 's bed . i give it a 5 , only because that 's the highest . makes a wonderful gift ! !
1	my little cousin sarah loves this toy . i bought it at wal-mart in springfield . it works with or without water and features realistic sounds . i am now on my way to purchase another for my 6 year old cousin sean
0	dont waste your money on this one . the picture is cute . but the quailty of the toy isnt any good . the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child . the concept is supposed to be like the game memory , your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting . your better off just buying the real memory game . the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price .
0	sure wish my mother-in-law had read these reviews before giving this to me for christmas . tried to play it once with my parents , who are also big 24 fans , a few nights later and were sorely disappointed . this game was obviously just shoved out the door to feed off the popularity of 24 the show and not to garner any popularity in its own right . the mini-games were an exercise in extreme frustration . the problem is that the dvd is not ideal for those mini-games . whenever you try to move there are only two subsequent animations : the successful one and the unsuccessful one , which made it seem like it was just moving at random . other than that it seemed like the game was going to be pretty linear , the clue cards contained no useful information , and the board completely superfluous , unless apparently you are masochistic enough to get to the bonus level
0	i can see from reading the below reviews that i 'm not the only one who hates this thing . what a total waste ! i got it for my little one , remembering how much i ( and every other kid i 've ever known ) loved this toy . well , this version has been made too safe to have any fun on . it barely spins . if you want your toddler to develop amazing upper body strength , then force them to work out on this thing a couple times a day . it 's almost impossible to spin and you never get up any momentum at all . not to mention the loud loud music with no volume control . which i could deal with if the thing was any fun at all
0	i saw an advertisement for this toy on the tv . i was shocked that they were still selling it ! years ago , my young son got his arm trapped inside the hole where the balls come out . we had called playskool and they had us return it to the store and they sent us a free 'i 'm sorry ' gift . the one pictured on amazon is the dangerous one that many kids have gotten their arms stuck in . if you look on the playskool website , they have a newer version which offers a cover over the hole where kids like to stick their little paws . be sure you get the newer version ! it is a super cute toy , and i am glad they have fixed the problem so many have had
1	i do n't understand why they are so offensive to people . i am christian , and i lvoe all three midnight dance dolls . i think they are more 'phantom of the opera ' than 'sadistic satinist ' . meygan is my favorite , but yasmin is still beautiful . these dolls are gourgeous
1	i bought this game for my mom for christmas and we played it ... right now it is in my game closet because i introduced this game to my poker friends and now we have `` pit '' night instead of poker night . we can not stop laughing when we play this game . we bring this to all get-togethers and everyone loves it.i had to buy my mom a new pit game because i take it all the time . this game is soooo much fun , the more people you play with the more fun it is ! ! ! get this game ! !
1	got this as a fun birthday present for my husband who adores anything star wars . he liked it so much he brought it to work and we now occassionally hear stories about darth potato and the spud troopers waging war on unsuspecting engineers . it 's a great geek toy
0	is n't barbie supposed to be pretty ? she looks like an ugly prostitute , hands down . i would n't `` wear that to a club '' and neither would any of my friends . her make up is gross , and especially the look on her face says , `` do me now . '' there 's a difference between beauty and over-the-top trashy . you ca n't deny that she looks like a porn-star , which is an industry that is illegal for teenagers who get this doll to participate in , but i guess we 're preparing our youth for this at a younger age now
1	i bought this toy because amamzon 's price was a great bargin compared to other stores . i would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way . there is a lot more room for more logs . 115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front . i ended up buying additional logs ( not lincoln logs ) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence
1	we purchased this for our 5 year old along with the spy goggles . he immensely enjoyed both . as a matter of fact , the adults were quite taken with it too
1	this is a must have for your little sweetheart ! my daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes . it 's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next ; ) the accessories are cute , but she 'd rather use stuff from mommy 's purse . ; ) the purse is oh so cute too , and durable . my daughter is 21 months old , she received this on christmas and has been a favorite since .
1	i bought this for my daughter for christmas , three days before her first birthday . she loves taking the pieces out , banging them together and recently , putting them in the correct spaces ! the size of the pieces is perfect for a young toddler and the knobs are the right size for her hands . will definately look at melissa and doug puzzles for her again
0	remember spirograph by kenner you played with as a kid ? this thing hasbro sells under the same name is not that toy . it is obviously of cheap quality , parred down to a handful of `` gears '' , and designed so poorly that it doesnt really work ! stick with the original , which means purchase it used on ebay , but do not buy hasbro 's spirograph .
0	lego is a great product , unfortunately this one 's just a little too ambitious . my son fell in love with this and begged for it for chanukah , but once we got it put together it would n't stay together to play with . it 's great to make smaller planes with , but the original plane just fell apart under it 's own weight .
0	put simply , this toy does n't work . or i should say perhaps it would work with really good bubble solution but it does not work with the bubble solution that comes with it . it sort of sputtered some bubble solution out the top but we never got even one full bubble much less the stream of bubbles we were hoping for . luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore did n't mind when we took it back
1	the game itself is actully pretty good . you can go through the entire price is right game or you can just go to each section . like if you just wanted to do the pricing games , there 's that option or you can do the showcase showdown etc ... there are times that the graphics of the game lag , which is kind of odd since to me since i was n't playing it on a computer , but on my dvd player . the pricing games are 'random ' but you do tend to get some of the same games more than other games . you can technically play this game by yourself , but it 's obviously going to be more fun the more people you have
0	i ordered this item and was so excited . it loaded fine . it let me upload files just fine . it was n't until i actually tried to create my pvd that i received errors that shut down the program ( many many many times ... with numerous types of video files ) i double checked the system requirements for the software and my computer checked out fine . the worst thing is that there is no support for the media player . i tried contacting hasbro with no response . i am so dissapointed .
0	this particular sudoku handheld was not as expected . it has only basic functions and the person i purchased for said it is easier just to do sudoku on line or in the newspaper or in a puzzle book . really inconvenient functions . may be good for young children , but not adults
0	i purchased this for my eight year old niece . we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks . be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer . the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive
1	if you love the unpredictable , then catch 22 is for you . this game has plenty of social interaction and combines skill with luck in the pursuit of 22 gold tokens . just when i thought i was about to win the game , my boyfriend landed on my game piece and stole all of my tokens . boy , that did not make me happy at all . the key to this game is to use your blocker cubes wisely . the cubes are used to either block an opponents way or safeguard your path to the money . once you use the cubes , you can only retrieve them by landing on a 'collect blocker ' square . you can collect any blocker cube placed on the board , including your opponent 's cubes . i made lots of money selling blocker cubes back to my opponents . we were so addicted to this game that we played it all night long . i highly recommend it , but be prepared to either win big or lose your shirt !
0	the only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet . but the real promise of this kit -- to see a model volcano erupt -- may not be fulfilled . we followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base ( above mentioned cheap plastic sheet ) that is extremely difficult to balance on 4 ill-fitting stilts . a poor experience for the kids . the eruption was more of a fizzle . waste of money and time
0	if it were up to my children , they would rate this stuff 5+ stars . they love it and they are totally entertained with it . it is one of the only times they play quietly without fighting . mom , on the other hand , hates it and you know it is bad when a toy gives mom some free time of peace and quiet and she wants no part of it ! ! ! this stuff sticks to everything and anything-including your children . you ca n't believe the mess it makes . imagine billions of tiny little balls stuck to everything in your house . i confine it to their playroom , but it follows them everywhere they go . you will find it all over your house and in everything-you ca n't escape it . as for the product itself , it definitely does n't dry out , but it also does n't hold together as well as described making it quite difficult to make the objects it claims you can make on the package . once you put colors together it is impossible to separate them out as they are tiny millimeter balls . playdooh may dry out if left out , but it does n't make anywhere near the mess this stuff does and it also molds much better than playfoam ! my advice is to stick with your playdooh
0	concept was good , but fails because its not constructed well . after 2 months the toy 's electronics went out
1	this made our 6 year old so happy ! great colors , great markers
1	this update of the old big wheel style `` green machine '' is made to handle the height , weight and wear and tear of big boys ( and girls , up to the latter 30s have even been caught on it ) , yet the seat is easily adjusted so that the average 5-year-old can reach its pedals . the main cool feature is the dual lever steering . just like with the original hollow model plastic version , pulling on the steering levers in opposite directions sends the machine into a wicked spin-out that kids just ca n't get enough of . yet under the usage of some pretty crazy 6 , 9 and 12 year olds on a steep downhill driveway , the machine has almost always remained three wheels on the ground . so first , i am amazed at the staying play value of this toy . for two years now , it has been the first toy out of the garage every time the door opens . and second , i am amazed at its durability . the 9 year old who uses it reguarly is an evel kneivel who is notorious for breaking my children 's toys left and right , and so far , it has held up without a squeak . this was a million times better value for our hundred spot , than the darn motorized motorcycle we bought a couple years prior for twice that amount which only lasted a year before the gears stripped . definitely consider this for your 5-10 year old boy , even if he already has a two-wheeler . it 's a whole different kind of fun . ***** all the way
0	while i certainly did n't expect these drum sticks to be whisper-quiet , i found them to be quite loud for little kids ' ears . and there was no volume control . also , i was hoping for a more authentic drum sound that i have found in other toys . i returned them
1	bought this item for mt son , and he just loves it . he plays with it all the time , from the time he gets home from school until dinner time , and from after dinner until bed time
1	i bought this for my niece 's 5th birthday , and she loved it ! my nephew ( 8 ) would n't leave her alone , he wanted to ride it . my brother-in-law got on it , and it actually moved him around . it is very durable , thick plastic looks like it will last a while . for the price , if it lasts this summer only , it is worth it
0	ho ho ho ! ! my 6 year old has been asking for this toy for about 6 months now and today he finally got it . he 's had it for about 5 hours now and is already tired of it . we 've tried no less that 20 different cars and have yet been able to get it to work . the only thing it seems to do consistently is play that obnoxious sound over and over again ( if you know how to turn the sound off , let me know . i 'm ready to remove the batteries or clip the speaker wire ) . do not buy this toy . you 'll be very disappointed in it .
0	although this new release from barbie looks very much like the real life singer , the doll itself is not something i would recommend for a child under 12 . the doll is dressed pretty sccantilly and is adorned with realistic jewlerly . it also comes with a bracelet appropriate for a teen . the short hair of this doll and tight clothing does not lend itself to childs play and is more suited to a serious doll collector or mcbride fan
0	i purchased this toy for my 3yr old in december last year . he has not been able to use it since we have not been able to find any products ( discs , carrying case etc ) for the videonow . i have called the company several times . everything is always unavailable and i do check on a regular basis . my son has been watching black and white discs recently from his older brother on the machine so he will get some use out of it . it was a good idea but the company leaves a lot to be desired . if you make a product make sure that there are enough discs . it is simply a waste of money and time . i can not continue going on line and checking a couple of times every week . i hope this info factors in in your decision to purchase this toy
0	the bed looks very nice.. [ ... ] when you have a toddler who is starting to climb out of their crib..this probably wo n't make it in the reviews but i 'm writing it anyway
1	i bought this for my 3 year old daughter . she loved it in the store and i thought it was cute . i also agree with the other reviewers that there should be instructions for the stickers , but you do n't need to be a genious to figure out where they go . i chose to not sharoen the pencil because she is 3 and i did n't think it was necessary . for twenty dollars it is a good buy . i know my daughter loves it and is having a lot of fun with it
1	previous reviews listed the lack of volume control as a negative point . in a panic i ran to check the three i have purchased for christmas gifts 2002 . all three have volume controls now ! do n't let reviews on a previous model keep you from purchasing these products . friends have these and my girls begged for their own . as a home-schooling mom i prefer to buy toys that are both fun and educational - leap frog is my best source
0	got this for xmas present for 2 year old . he loved it , but sounds and steam quickly stopped working with zero abuse . incredibly cheap for a toy costing 40 bucks . this is just how to ruin a fan of the show . the folks who design such badly designed stuff should be ashamed of themselves . my son is important and deserves toys that can last more than two days
0	i am a seamstress who knows how to sew , and how to thread both top and bobbin threads . my daughter received this machine for christmas . we threaded it according to directions . it sews about 10 stitches then jams . i observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing , and leads to a jam every time . do n't disappoint a child by purchasing this
1	this is a well engineered product ; i can not call it a toy because it is much much more than that . after building just one of the sample setups i was able to put down the manual and start creatively designing and building my own . my daughter ( 3.5 years old ) loves it . she really likes placing a marble on the run when i tell her its time to `` test it '' , and i let her identify the error . the only marbles that have fallen off the track are due to construction errors by myself . after 1 day ( and several of our own setups ) we already find ourselves wanting more pieces . i suggest buying the largest set from the get go if you have an engineering type mind or just enjoy puzzles . nice feature to note : the coloring of the blocks is logical ; each color has its own unique function ( s ) .
0	i do n't know if we got some old box left over , or what . magnets are so weak , that kids ca n't make anything vertical . they just collapse , and slide . if i knew of course i would n't have purchased . i got rid of the box , so i could n't even return it . over priced big time ! !
0	i have to agree with everyone before me . flimsy , hard to put together , does n't stay together , impossible to close . my four old , who is obsessed with batman , lost interest after 5 minutes and i really ca n't blame him . spend your $ 50 on something else ! ! ! not a good purchase ! ! ! ! !
0	if i would have been able to try this out before buying it i would have never bought it . the surface is way to hard for a baby to be laying on it . the it is not too sensitive to movement so when baby kicks or moves it doesnt always turn itself on . i would have much rather bought a playmat instead .
1	bought this for my 2 1/2 year old for christmas and he loves it . all you have to do is press a button on the back and it moves it 's head and roars . very easy for the young kids to do and my little guy loves it
1	we did not buy the refill but purchased the original set with sandbox . it works wonderfully and my kids have played with it for hours . clean up is easy . another family i know just used theirs for the 1st time and they also had a wonderful experience .
1	i bought this set for my son who loves to draw and paint . he absolutely loved this set . the colors are wonderful and the different types of pens , paints and crayons make drawing alot more fun for him . the case is sturdy and great so he does n't lose anything . the price ca n't be better for everything you get .
1	this doll is cute and fun to play with . my daughter loves it . i like these dolls better then bratz . they need to make more dolls that are dressed the way kids are . i think that lil does . im happy and my daughter has a toy i think will be around for a long time .
0	have this unit in out house , we have the one with one base unit and two mobile units . a few things to note . the ones we had do not offer rechargeable batteries . it uses alkaline only , or if you have your own charger you could use rechargeable but would be nicer if it recharged while plugged in . we live in nyc , queens to be exact . we hear taxi cab radio chatter over this at times , especially at night . also if unit is close to base unit static is not too bad but still annoying in bedroom , but if you have it one floor away , forget it . unless child is screaming all you hear is static . on both units . only has two channels a b which are set manually at both base and hand held units . so if you have a bad signal in middle of night , you have to go into child 's room and change channel . just do n't wake the baby ! ouch ! also missing a pager and a `` walkie talkie '' feature . they would be very nice . not a deal breaker if they do n't have it but it can be handy especially if your two floors up with baby with a full diaper and spouse is in basement and you need more diapers from garage . i am about to have a second child , and i am replacing this unit with a better one , i am looking at one of the new digital units that have the noise/static reduction . consumer reports gave some of them their top marks . they are however way more pricey than these , some are near $ 200 and only one receiver . but they all have charging bases and most importantly they are static free with auto channel switching
1	i got this as a gift for my neece , she loves it , her parents love it too . she is now three years old , she got it last yr. for christmas , ... i was over to see her yesterday , and it still is like new . the velcro is very strong.. and it 's a very safe toy.. her baby brother , now is playing with it too , he is one yr . i recommend to all ! great buy .
0	i am very unhappy with this product . the handle is hard to turn , and it takes too long for the clown to pop up . when the clown does pop up it smells like a forst fire inside of the toy . over all i would not recomend it
1	it 's amazing how much a child learns by having access . we are an american family living in germany and felt my 5 year old would have a greater understanding of where we live and where our extended family lives
1	my baby is only a year old and has a blast playing in his tent and tunnel .
0	i was disappointed with the quality of this item . little tike is a name i have learned to trust and this was a bummer . the front broke because of it 's poor design and flimsy plastic parts . so now it is just a broken dump truck . also you have to push the button for the sounds to work . it is not motion sensitive .
0	we bought this for our snowboarding 11-year-old son . being used to playstation and gamecube , he was n't impressed with the graphics and control of the characters is very clunky . it 's a cool concept -- but it needs more time in development
0	we like the lunchbox because of the cute designs , but were a little disappointed in it 's durability . the first time i dropped it on the ground , it scratched off parts of the design . so , mom did some creative thinking and did some touch up paint and sealed the design with `` self laminating sheets '' . that did the trick . we also wished the thermos and lunchbox were insulated . other than that , it 's o.k
1	the 3-d solar system is great . i rated it 5 stars because i knew there was no sun , so this product was exactly what i expected . easy to hang up , glows well , my 6 year old son is very happy with it ! a sun would be nice , but still well worth the money
0	not only did this phone not work , but the screen was really quite tiring on my eyes . the only ringtone that it had was a sound like beads being shaken up . the flashing light was distracting , and its features were extraordinarily limited ! the camera option did n't work at all , and where the heck was the texting ? ? ? my parents bought this phone for me for my birthday , and it really made me mad ! ! i can see that this might be a good starter phone , but you can only get 0 calls froim it , and really limited reception in the mountains . switch to a razr as soon as possible
1	very pleased with this purchase ... my 2 yr. old daughter loves playing with her new kitchen ! the kitchen came fully assembled and all plastic parts are very sturdy . the telephone is fun - and is actually my daughter 's favorite part of the whole kitchen ! i know of 4 other friends who have this same kitchen - and all are pleased with their purchase
0	it 's a pretty good toy but most people get sick of them as they get frustrated and ca n't do every side the same colour on each side . if you 're ready for frustration then this cube is for you . if you are buyin it then have fun
0	my son got this for his 4th birthday . moon sand is a terrible toy -- ugly and messy . he seemed to enjoy playing with it ( but no more than play doe ) , but the clean up is horrible . the sand stuck to the treads of his shoes and was tracked throughout the house .
0	my 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon , and so did i initially . however , during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder . the problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy . my son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when i saw what had happened . personally , i would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented . otherwise , i would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product .
0	this is not really a practical toy . my son gets discouraged , because you have to press on the keys really hard and in order to follow the music you have to be rough . it 's like playing musical chairs with 5 bullies and a moving floor
0	i got this toy for my one of my triplet sons for his 5th birthday , and i am appalled that i paid $ 50 for such a poorly made product . they say it `` transforms '' into the batmobile - that is a joke ! you have to take most of it apart to get it to fold back up , so why bother with that `` feature '' in the first place ? the whole thing is made terribly . it barely stands upright , and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks . none of my boys play with it , and now i am stuck with it because i do n't have the box anymore to return it . bottom line : this was a complete waste of money
1	my son absolutely adores all his thomas the tank engine stuff . what can i say ? edward the blue engine is a fine addition to any child 's collection
0	i do n't usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy . i agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my 4-year-old daughter ! also our dolphins fall off and the one that is supposed to flip around gets stuck and does not flip half the time . all that being said , she loves it
0	yum ... play food ! this is a great set . i will buy it as soon as i find it . this is a great set ! lots of cans ( good for storage ) , ice cream , boxed treats , cookies , ( yummy ) , and of course , much more . and who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs ? and is that chocolate chips on the ice cream ? oh my gosh , it 's better than i thought . you might think that to have a good time , your child needs 40 dollar melissa and doug wooden play food with real cutting noises and a fisher price 100 dollar kitchen for imaginative play . bullpies , i say . i have tons of dollar-store food . i have ultra-realistic foam food from a kitchen set i got . i prefer the dollar store food . dollar store food is better because it has more in one package , looks real , is cheap , pretty durable , and looks nice . i have a really silly play food set that came with a stovetop ( small , but the knobs turn ! ) , a pink and purple propane tank , a can of `` barracuda '' ( seriously ) , and a can of `` barracuda hash '' which included barracuda , ham and eggs , chicken , turkey , potpie , and more eggs . but the logo has spam and a hotdog , and the front of it has beans , turkey , fish , sausage , and lots of weird meat . but it says `` eatable , 100 % dainty , present ! , daintiness , dainty '' . just wanted to let you know . so , bottom line is , dollar store play food is much better than you think it is . it comes with lots of things that the expensive companies would never have dreamed of
1	legos , duplos , ello.. they do n't hold a candle to the kid knex in the series . unbelieveable how much our 6 year old daughter plays with these and our 3 yo son too . these have a good feel for kids too . bright . easy to use . we have all in set now . bring on some more
0	this bowl is extremely cute but it does not suction to the high chair . i can get it to suction to the counter and my glass table but not on my baby 's highchair , so it really does n't serve the purpose it is suppose to
1	i purchased this train case for my son last christmas , ( age 6 ) . it is very sturdy , with handle . i like that all the trains can be put into one place and carried away simply/easily . those moms like myself , when your child has finished playing , there is now a place for them to put their trains in . the 'metal ' case is a great added bonus , the trains have the magnetic ends and they easily go into case . next play time , the trains are all in one spot . thomas , come up with a place like this for the track - i need it
1	this is perfect for any kurt cobain/nirvana fan . it looks great , definitely reminiscent of the smells like teen spirit music video . i bought it as a gift but almost kept it for myself ! if you are thinking of getting it , i would recommend you do so . you wo n't be disappointed
0	my 10 year old received the massively mini media player for christmas and she and i both are very disappointed in it . there is simply not enough memory and this product does not seem to be compatible with our napster files ( at least not readily . perhaps i could burn them to cd then rip them back to my computer and then transfer them to the mini media player but i have not tried that yet . ) folks , 128mb is a joke even for a young child . there are much better players out there in the same price range . i own the sansa e250 which is a solid little mp3 player and i am seriously considering buying the same model for her as well
0	the retro-slinky dog , however cute , just does n't work . we have tried it on the hardwood floor , the carpet , the title . we have tried tying a string arounds it 's neck , adding a string to it 's short stubby string , using the short stubby string to pull it but nothing works . our kids 2 6 just drag it around laying on it 's side -- it 's just not fun -- the head is too heavy and it does n't move well at all . i would not buy it . the fisher price doggy we got is very cute and it stays upright , it walks with you and the pull-string is a good length -- plus it 's cute too ! !
1	this game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it . his little sister , who is two , also loves this game . this game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues . it is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept . there are no complex rules to learn , so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game . as each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match . best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the tv turned off
1	i love this thing ! great product , great deal , great times to look forward to with my grandson - he simply goes nuts over it ! thanks
0	this toy is not what i had expected . it is n't very durable at all and it 's hard to put together ! i do n't highly recommend it
0	we purchased all of the figures for my daughter for christmas . within 2 weeks of her receiving this one , the pin fell out of her leg and her leg fell off . we replaced it with a new one and the pin on the leg of that one fell off within a month . the head does not stay on invisible violet , syndrome broke in half , violet 's pin fell out of her arm , and mr . incredible lost the pin in his leg . my daughter does not play rough with her toys . just normal play and they fell apart . also , helen is supposed to be elasta girl . why did n't they make her stretch ? did n't make sense to me
0	i ca n't wait until i get the movie barbie fairytopia mermaida when it comes out its going to be a great movie for kids and even for the whole family i do n't know if i will get the dolls i think the movie will be funer to watch than just play with the doll
0	i was very happy to discover that i could purchase an asian cabbage patch girl doll ... it was for a little korean girl ... .the doll pictured on the website looked like the little girl that it was purchased for ( the hair ) . well , i was excited to find one and i wanted to make sure that i would receive it in time to wrap it and mail it to texas in time for christmas . i ordered in on the 27th and received it on dec. 1st ( i paid for faster shipping ) . when i opened the box it was an asian doll but not the one with the ponytails ... this doll had short hair . i called amazon immediately and although they expressed being sorry they said that they could not guarantee that it would n't happen again . i have used amazon before with no problems but i am extremely unhappy with the bait and switch . i should have read the other reviews . i will never let that happen again . beware ... do not order things of this nature from this website . you will be disappointed
1	this is a quality product . good detail . holds air well , ready to blow up and hang from attached loop . an excellent buy
0	we bought this for our 10 month old son for christmas . he really enjoys it , but the steering stripped out within the first week so he can only go straight . we have to follow him around and turn it . other than that it 's been a good buy . he can play with it inside and out . he 's 16 months old now and will be getting a bigger , faster 12 volt 4-wheeler soon
0	i would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 1/2 years ( unless small for their age ) . my 4 yr old son ( 36lbs ) got it for his birthday , and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes . there is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car , but its been `` parked '' since broken . i wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted . the plastic seems cheaply made . the voice buttons and noises are loud and work well . stickers have already started to flake/peel off after 1 month . consider a bigwheel
1	my nephew absolutely loved the games in this nemo cartridge ... i did do because they are educational and teach him various things that he probably would have no interest in ... at least he is broading his horizons in a way that he enjoys
1	i purchased this expansion set , along with the thomas and friends water towr figure 8 set , for my 2 year old this past christmas . the expansion set was an afterthought , prompted in no small part by the manufacturer 's promotion running at the time ( 50 % off this set with the purchase of a figure 8 set ) . with the conclusion of many initial hours of intense playtesting ( an ongoing process , with no termination in sight ) , my son agrees that this is an essential choice for any but the most basic ( read : boring ) wooden railroad layout . this expansion pack comes with switch tracks , and allows little train engineers ( and their dads ) to reverse directions or explore different parts of the railway . in retrospect , i think that i would have been dissatisfied had i not purchased this set to complement the basic figure 8 layout , promotional price or not . as far as the quality , the learning curve wooden track is made from hardwood , and is more substantial than many other brands of compatible track ( i.e . maxim , first learning , etc. ) . this is a consideration when your child insists on taking the track apart by him/herself to put away . we have already broken a couple of pieces of generic track this way , since the male end of the connectors is a bit weaker than the rest of the track . overall , we are quite satisfied with this set , and look forward to many more hours of enjoyment
1	i bought this for a present for my 2 yr old daughter and she likes it and can turn the handle
1	my grandparents bought me this for christmas and i really love it ! the doll is absolutely breathtaking , and she has honey blond hair with golden highlights . her eyes are a deep blue green color , and she is very pretty overall . the closet she comes with is very cute , and i can put barbie shirts and skirts on the little hangers ! there is a lot of room for shoes and purses and hair accessories , i love this toy
1	it is really expensive for what it is . i have to say my children love it , esspecially since we can put it in the middle of the table and everyone can take what they need from it . i love that when we are done you can put everything back and stick it on a shelf . however , for the supplies you get it is expensive . the tote itself is nice but not worth more than $ 5 , add the supplies to it , maybe i could see spending $ 10 . however , if you catch it on sale i would pick up a few , they make great gifts
0	not sure what happened , but i received my daughter 's gift in the mail today . there were no penguins in the box , and but the packaging looked original with no tampering . beware , if you 're ordering from imaginarium ! what a disappointment this was for us
0	i had purchased two of these smack and yack cars for my grandson . while wrapping them the night before i planned to give the gift , i discovered that they did not make noise as advertised . if i had looked at them earlier , i would have returned them for a refund . it 's no fun to have grandchildren that are disappointed
1	my son got this for christma when he was 10 months old . from day one he loves to push it around the house . he 's 13 months old now and he can get on to ride it . his friends love it also .
0	i 'm sure this would be a fun toy , but for us it did n't last long enough to find out . we had this in our pool for 5 minutes and one of the guns stopped working . the boys were very disappointed ! i will be taking this back to the store tonight and try to exchange it with a new one that hopefully works
0	while my son enjoyed the illustrations anf fun content of the books in this set , i felt it was disappointing as a learning tool for beginning readers because it moves much too quickly . the first book is just letters and letter sounds . very introductory . the second book introduces three letter words right off with no transition at all like 2 letter blends . that was ok to me since it was phonetic 3 letter words , but by page 2 we were already `` leaping '' to 4 and 5 letter words and by page 3 they were already introducing a sight word - `` does '' and a double consonant word - `` can not '' . i thought the pace was frustrating for my son . i was hoping/expecting a book devoted to just blends and/or 3 letter words . instead this program is organized by vowels with the letter a being introduced first . i do n't see that as a problem , but i was expecting more phonetic 3 letter words to start and introducing harder 4 and 5 letter words by maybe book 3 and sight words coming later , like maybe book 4 . unfortunately , you ca n't see exactly what your getting until you open the box . nonetheless , the audio is entertaining for children with music and humor thrown in and the reward stickers , poster , and ribbon are a fun way to recognize your child 's achievement . the practice game is basically just like the word whammer fridge phonics product but with cards instead of magnets
1	my 3 yo twin boys love this , but one station is a little difficult to maneuver , it is very sensitive , even for my 6 yo boy . all in all , i would recommend this for all those little train lovers !
0	even though i purchased this watch for my grandson for christmas from another store , it was not worth the money . it does nothing and my grandson abandoned it soon after opening it . i picked up few pieces from under the sofa last night . i did see on one toy store 's website that there is a deluxe model that is probably better . i wish i had known that before i spend $ 10 on this piece of junk .
0	this product is a box o ' junk . my son got this for christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it . the hat fell apart within three days ( and he hardly played with it - just wore it on his head a few times ) - the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat , which is obviously dangerous . i contacted the company and they have not responded .
1	my son got this game as a gift . i brought it into my junior high classroom to use on a game day . the kids love this game and request it over and over . many other teachers have asked to borrow it for their classes . it is a great vocabulary builder . i also made my own cards with letters of the alphabet on them . i use these when we are studying parts of speech -- they have to come up with a noun ( adjective , verb , etc ) that begins with that letter . this is a great game and a good way to make a rather dull subject more interesting
1	when the toa and all the first bionicles came out , it was very simple and straigthforward . bad guys were different from the toa and everyone knew they were bad . now , with the pirahka , we have villians claiming to be toa ! and the matoran believe them ! one of the things i really love about zaktan is his weapon . it looks really cool and can change . also , the little ball launcher ( i forget what it 's called ) is a lot of fun ( i shot my brother with it x3 ) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome ! though the rubber part is sligthy annoying , it does n't really get in the way
1	my 3 year old just loves it.. this truck has been great and very durable.. i have a 9 year old boy and he and his friends have just as much fun as my little one.. we love the fact that we are the only one in the neighborhood that has the black escalade.. we have certainly got our moneys worth .
1	it is fun to play with and kind of educational because you have to strap the babies in their car seats
