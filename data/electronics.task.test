0	the leather case works great . easy access to buttons , space for business cards and sd cards . ah ! ... the smell ... leather . five stars
0	this thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over . we thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery did n't help . do n't buy this item . i am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here
0	i 've come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse . the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface , and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser wo n't track right . i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it did n't test it well enough . unless your willing to do that skip this one , it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice . i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul . but then again you do get what you pay for :
1	i needed extra space for pictures and musis downloads this was just right not too expensive and large enought to fit the purpose
0	these actually left my screen dirtier than i started with . it left behind annoying streaks and film which i ultimately ended up having to clean off with my usual homemade solution . i suggest keeping a soft cloth with some 1:1 water and rubbing alcohol handy ; it 's cheaper and more effective
1	i liked this charger so much that i ended up ordering a second unit . premium solid performance in addition to 3 years warranty ! i called lenmar company since the fan on the second charger did not work out of the box but guess what , they sent me another charger without hussle ! the call took about 2 minute and the replacement part was already on its way , they definetly stand by and back up their warranty . no problems with the second unit and if i ever need another one i would still buy a lenmar . the two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar ppro-h batteries , one can use the slot number 1 and 4 for regular nimh batteries , it charges regular high capacity batteries to an 80 % level in less than 15 minutes , and the other ppro-h batteries in about 7-8 minutes . i did n't notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the ppro-h batteries , but the ppro-h kind are more durable . this charger is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage 110-240 v and the first to use neothermÂ® charging technology ! it 's solid and heavy duty charger , not like the cheap kind that are everywhere . i went through lots of sony chargers but you know what ? they will never see my money again ! the sony chargers are crappy and fry a lot , i have been using the msc815 since october 2005 almost daily and never once i had an issue with it
1	when i buy flash memory , i consider price , speed , manufacturer and vendor . i got this particular memory stick for a sonyericsson w810i phone . i paid extra to get it from amazon ( no they do n't always have the best price ) . this way i am confident that i can return it if i got the wrong one or have a problem with it . the card works fine in my phone , and since i have a usb cable that hooks up to the phone , i do n't have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader . i have not yet experienced any problems with sandisk memory products . i am told that the sandisk sticks are faster than sony 's , but i have no way to confirm this , nor do i know if my phone ( mp3 player , camera ) is able to take advantage of faster speeds . the longest process is transferring music to the phone , and i was n't in a hurry anyway . this stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format , so i can use the 128mb stick that i replaced in my sony camcorder ( which had a 4mb stick in it . no , it 's not a typo . it 's actually a 4 megabyte memory stick )
1	had mine for over half a year now , and after outstanding abuse it performs as well as the day i bought it . i fill it and empty it every month , rarely ever defragging it , back up my pc files and play movies right off it on my laptop . throw it in my backpack , plug and unplug it all day ( hotswaping ) , still with rarely a sign of slowdown , and it barely gets from cool to warm ever ( even when its running from inside my backpack ) . for some reason requires two usb ports on my new pc ( high speed usb2.0 ports ) when it should n't . it runs on one port at school just fine and i have switched the y cable with a regular usb cable with 50 % success . i 'd buy another one of these in a heartbeat if i ever thought the one i have would run itself out . the fact that it does n't need an external ac adapter to run on my usb1.1 laptop ports ( though it does have a hole for a non-included ac adapter ) is a blessing . i 've even used its double usb cord to run my power hog of an external cd-rom drive ( my cd-rom ac doesnt work on both sadly ) . might be luck of the draw , hd related items seem to be sometimes , and i 've yet to have to try out their customer service . but overall worth every cent spent ( especially since i was looking at a 4gb external for $ 40 before i saw this ) . nearly $ 1 a gig is a great deal .
0	i ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices ( all had the same description and specs ) . it worked for about 2 weeks , and then quit . a friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette , which had come loose . since then it has come loose twice more , so i just do n't use it anymore . when it worked , it worked fine , but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution
0	when i received my cobra nav system the cord to use it was missing and i have had to call three times and still nhave not received the cord . i contacted cobra , but i think it came from target.co
0	tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper . i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you . but if you wan na save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality
1	my mother-in-law had one of these that she uses to clean her sewing machine . i rebuild computers and thought how handy this would be and how much money i would save on air cans that are $ 5 ea . and i have bought a million of . i love this little vacuum attachment set , it works great and has a multitude of uses and has already saved me a bundle ... thanx cyber-guys ! ! ! ! you rock ! !
1	since there is now relatively few choices for a good corded phone ( esp . with caller id ) , this phone is tops . this phone and all other at phones corded or cordless , exhibit slight feedback when talking loud or when hanging up . but no other phone out there seems to be nearly as durable . given the other choices , this is the one to get
1	this review pertains specifically to the targus pauh217u 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub . the cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc , which sits on the ground , to the top of the desk . it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs - one just to transmit data , the second to power the unit . the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware , and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways ? if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing , then it does have an input for a separate power source , which you will have to buy separately . in short , if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use , this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk
1	i can verify again that this is indeed 16 gauge wire . this size works very well for small-medium satellite speakers . i am using this wire with a samsung ht-q80 htib . it 's working wonderfully and i 'm getting nice crisp sound . unlike the other reviewer , my spool came fully intact . i would suggest this for anybody looking for good , cheaply priced 16 gauge speaker wire
1	i am an it director and bought these for exercisers for my users . the outside is like a balloon , only much stronger rubber , and the inside is gel . when you squeeze them , the part that squeezes through your fingers changes color - it 's cool ! the resistance is very good and my users love them ! good product - great value and excellent quality
1	this has got to be the easiest piece of tech i have ever set up . except for charging , it took under 5 minutes . it works as advertised . i use skypein and skypeout . my phone bill is now $ 68 a year instead of $ 384 . i also get voice mail for free with the skypein . call quality seems as good as ma bell . i was concerned with it being made by netgear , as i have had spotty luck with their products . i liked this phone so much , i just purchase another handset ( it can support up to 4 ) . this phone will pay for itself in a few months
0	reception is only acceptable if you are seated with the headphone antenna adjusted to maximize signal strength
1	i have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts . all in all pretty pleased with the purchase . it was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my ipod mini . there are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models . panicked at first because they did n't have one for the mini , but it was already installed on the model . cons : - light dimmer has three settings , but even the lowest is too bright . you can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote . - no ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week . for example 7:00am monday to friday , no alarm on weekends . - wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset ( by you ) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle . - sound is great for an alarm clock . do n't think it will compare with a mini stereo or bose sounddock . would buy again at the price
1	besides the fact that ipod is a skinny little waste of time , let 's also mock the fact that it plays about two formats : whatever mac plays , and mp3 . woohoo . what a selection . then , we have the iaudio . it has perhaps a half inch thickness , at most , over the ipod for the standard battery model ( 20gb and 30gb anyway ; 60gb is as thick as an xl ) , though it includes so much more bang for your buck , even if some of that bang is kind of useless . but come on ; an fm radio is n't ipod standard ? almost every other portable hd player has that by now . about the only thing ipod has over iaudio is movie quality , which is , admittedly , better . but i 'm fairly basic ; i 'm buying it for my music , not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen . if i want to do that , i 'll buy a portable dvd player . for pictures , unless they 're ridiculously high quality , this suits just fine . but it 's not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players ; it 's the sound quality . which . is . marvelous . it consistantly beats ipod , it has bbe equalizer , and it not plays mp3 and aac , but wma , wav , ooc , and flac . *flac . * and if you download rockbox ( which is something you 'll have to research on your own , kids ) , you can create themes , boost your battery life , and augment your listening pleasure even further . the only drawbacks are the battery life if you do n't use playlists , skip around a lot , or play high bitrate files ( all of which are fixed rather well by rockbox ) , and the subpack . what is a subpack ? it 's a fairly good idea done badly . it 's a piece of [ ... ] plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player . in it are the power jack , line-out ( which has a bad bass roll-off problem , unfortunately ) and line-in jack , and usb port . the general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else , but it was n't executed too well . buying a charger from [ ... ] .com solves the power jack and usb port problems nicely , and is recommended most highly . ( and did i mention recording with the built-in mic is amazing ? you can get good quality concerts with this puppy . ) plus , it 's black . ipod comes standard white . and the x5 is just better
1	this mount is perfect ! it sticks well to the windshield , keeps the gps rock steady . it allows you to swing to driver , center and passenger 's views and back without any bending or remounting . i am very pleased ! my roadmate looks a 100 % better on this mount . i hated the mount that came with the gps . the build quality of this mount also seems to be very good . i would highly recomend this mount
0	i do not like this item because it says it is a 16x dvd but when i put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x . something is wrong with the dvds because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner . so if you are looking for 16x , do not buy this one
1	this is perfect for my ipod and keeps it totally secure while driving . great price and you get different sizes to match your car perfectly .
1	i 've used the sd-yd250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear . overall , the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor-saving convenience . i 've used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough . it can also save a lot of money , provided you purchase the yeast in bulk ( for example 2lb ) . the single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at american supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram . particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough . this takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza , and when the dough is refrigerated for later use , it tastes even better in my opinion . like most engineered products of our age , this one is full of cute features that add little value , or cause annoyance . the yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best . if you use it , you ( for the most part ) create extra work for yourself because you 'll have to clean it later . the dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use . they make a marginal difference in baking results . i only use the quick bake mode , which takes 2 hours to complete . let 's say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings ( easy to do given the many parameters you can set ) . you just push the reset or cancel button and start over , right ? nope , no such button exists . then unplug the unit and plug it back in , right ? nope , the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages , so the unit remembers where it left off . yes , but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes , and after 10 minutes it will forget , right ? nope , i tried this , too . the unit does indeed forget eventually , but it 's more than 11 minutes . if you plug it back too early , the timer resets and you have to wait again . to summarize , the hardware is excellent , and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber
1	which was nomadland . the bono-pod is beautiful . however the inconsistency of the ipod itself is a nightmare . i 've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs . it 's apparently a known problem with several models of the device , with no particular fix . great .
0	i loved this printer ! ! the print quality is truly phenomenal ! i had a few issues with paper sizes , too many pieces being fed through , the rear feed slot , same as other reviewers , but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful . and yes , i am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer , because it is dead at the ripe old age of 13 months ! exactly one month after the 1-yr warranty , my printer is `` unfixable '' . and hp wo n't do anything for me ... after speaking to 8 people on the phone ( only one of which i understood fully ) and 3 supervisors , they just said that i 'm sol ... so , yes , very nice printer , if it lasts
0	horrible . the gears ingage before the tape is even loaded . you have to force the tape into the moving gears and hold down the tape door as it does not latch to stay closed on it 's own . when the tapes are rewinding it is very loud and slams the tape when it is done . you can just hear the damage being done . this model destroyed several of my daughters tapes . we really needed a rewinder to preserve our vcr and chose this model because it has an option to clean the tapes , preserving them also - this would be great providing it functioned properly . thinking maybe i got a defunct one i had amazon send out another , it too functioned in the exact same manner . nope mine was n't bad , their all bad , this model is disfunctional . i 've advised amazon not to carry units that they have become aware do not work properly . i wish amazon direct had good models to choose from , this one is not
1	i use this subwoofer to augment my 7.1 system . it was easy to install , gives excellent response , and i could n't be more pleased .
1	if you snap shots in burst mode , or if you want to take pictures at sporting events , fast cards like those are the way to go . almost no lag , large capacity , lifetime warranty , no complaints
1	i purchased the docking station for potability when on the beach , at the pool or camping . i had it going nonstop for 8.5 hours on the same set of batteries it was still going strong . i would by again
1	i am a mild audophile , and i love these headphones . they have great base response , treble , and isolation . if you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop , do n't get get these ! you wo n't be able to hear a thing outside of the music
1	i 've been a gamer for almost 20 years . this is the best mouse i 've ever owned . it is fast , accurate , well formed and constructed . i would definitely recommend it . the dpi adjustment is a nice touch . i prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy , this mouse is just right
1	this is an amazing little device . i carry every word and excel file i have created in the last year on this device . how remarkable is that ? kingston really had a better profile than other thumb drives . i still have my clip cap after several months . i carry it with me daily . the really powerful potential for these devices is yet to be realised but i 'm thinking about them ! let me know how you are using yours . in addition to my data files , i downloaded applications giving my flash drive the power to accomplish tasks on its own . overall , i am happy with my drive and believe as you think of new ways to employ one you will be too . i give this device a big thumb 's up
0	operates as described but lacks browser for use in pay for connection environments , poor battery life , need to have it fully charged every day even if you did not use it the previous day . needs mute function . volume could be louder , too . i would wait and buy next generation
0	i bought this to work with my emac/700 . it met all of the system requirements given . what was n't said was that it was n't supported by the mac 's 10.3.9 operating system and would only work while running the toast 6 lite . in other words i could n't read or write disks from any other application on the mac . in fact it would immediately eject the disk when i quit toast . luckily , amazon took it back . they even paid the postage . unfortunately i 'm still out my hours of research and 30 mile drive getting it to the post office . additionally , having found a new `` hi tech '' way to fib , i 'm discourage from buying computer peripherals from amazon . i blame sony for this . i know amazon ca n't check out every manufacturer 's claims
1	this is what you want , '' top of the line '' never get lost again no more spat with your friends , or others . just get the magellan and you are on your way . everyone should have one
1	i bought this because i needed good phones without the extra bulk . they 're really lightweight , but not flimsy . they have very good sound quality . i really like the volume control on the headphones themselves . it gives me the extra level of control . all in all , a really good bang for your buck
1	great price ! cant compare it to the more expensive `` monster cables '' but i cant imagine it being worth paying 50 dollars more for pretty much the same components
1	maybe i 'm bias because i really like yamaha , maybe , because i have kinda ' good ears or , it 's the fat check sitting on my table from yamaha ; but what ever it is i realllllllly like this sub-woofer . i looked around a long time for the right sub , and , i like to think i got a good one here . you want power ? ok , it 's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like velodyne , but in my room ( 30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling ) it rocks . i love music , all kinds ; loud or quiet no matter i like both , but i do like depth more than volume . however , i believe if you are going to listen to something real loud , being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it . and let me say you can feel music if you want to . one of the things i love most about this sub is it 's range ; it can ( maybe ) reach 20 hertz . 20 hertz ! that is astounding . 20hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear , in fact it 's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard . maybe i have good ears and maybe i do n't , but to hear rich airy low-end , and , bass notes . yes ! bass notes ! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise , it 's huge , open , grazing pasture of distinct sounds ! in short , music sounds great , even hip-hop ( which i do n't like ) sounds , well , better . also , their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement ; at very quiet levels too , you can hear good clean bass notes . but , if you do a lot of quite listening , we 're talking back ground music levels : disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off , because if you happen to be listening to something quiet , even if you still can here low notes from this , it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on , well ... on . it improves movies as well , take something with a lot of dynamics like , `` the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy '' or , `` sky captain and the world of tomorrow '' there are a lot of sudden loud , and very low sounds in those movie 's and the yamaha handles it all with aplomb . with most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy , and if you are wondering about the `` bass '' button : if the button is in the `` music '' position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the `` movie '' position ( i think `` music '' is a flatter frequency response ) . as this review seems to be getting a bit long i 'll some it up : yes , there are far better subwoofers out there ( like from b ) , but i do n't have the money for those , and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt velodyne i would take it in a heartbeat- but , i would n't want to give this one up too . it 's a absolute pleasure to listen to . update : i have run some test tones on this subwoofer , and well , it can not reach 20hz . 38hz seems to be the limit for usable bass , although it is still audible to around 32hz , 20hz is a stretch . if 38hz sounds to high : their are not many movie 's or cd 's that have any sounds below 35hz . and very , very few have sound below 25hz . although it does not go as low as i would have hoped , it is still a good sub for the money , and still worth a five star review
1	in spite of some of the poor reviews for this product , it met all of my expectations 100 % . thanks to the reviews , i understood that the unit does n't have a builtin antenna or batteries , which was helpful to know in advance . but of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place . i was looking for a small tv to fit in the corner of my bathroom , and this unit is perfect for that . as a bonus , i can not only watch the news while i 'm getting ready for work in the morning , but i can listen to mp3 rips when i 'm in the shower . i 've owned the unit for several weeks now , use it every day , and have never had a problem playing any disk , either copy-protected movies or cds . my only concern so far has been that i did n't receive a warrantee card with the unit . i especially like the portability . it 's so easy to pick up and take anywhere , such as watching a movie in bed , and even outside ( if it 's not too bright out ) for watching sports on the patio . the speakers are adequate , considering their size , and the headphone jack lets me either use headphones or external amplified speakers if i want better quality . in summary , i have to repeat that my expectations were set before i bought the unit and i am very pleased with what i got for the price
0	just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced . this is a $ 5.00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit . it will protect against scratching , but only the areas of the unit you 're not really concerned about . the screen is totally exposed , so it can be scratched when in the unit . i 'm sure that 's so you can see the screen better , but a clear protective cover ( that can open and close ) over the screen would have been nice . anyway , at $ 25.00 this is too much to spend . i 'm ordering a leather cover with a kick stand ( which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table ) for less than the price of this product . i feel i just flushed $ 25.00 bucks down the drain , hopefully you will not .
1	this is my first plasma tv and i love it . we bought this to put the icing on the cake after having remodeled our complete house . the tv sounds great , and looks great . hdtv is stunning ! i am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this tv to anyone
1	these buds are definitely a step up from the standard ipod buds . they stay in your ears much more easily ( without the foam black covers , which are easily lost ) , the sound is at least marginally better , and the overall construction seems to be better . you ca n't do much better for the money . however , if you 're willing to spend a little more , the jlab jbuds are the way to go . i own both the gumys and the jbuds , and the gumys are my workout pair , and i use the jbuds for everything else . but if you 're looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the ipod buds , the gumys are the way to go
0	heres a new one ... .i have recently bought two spindles of these discs , and my computer ( imac w/ intel chip-hardly outdated ) simply doesnt recognize them-like i never put in a disc at all . the kicker is that this spring , i also ordered two spindles of these discs ( exactly the same as far as i can tell ) , from which i burned one hundred discs ( not a single faulty one ! ) for a freind overseas . i have no idea what the deal is , but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs . anyone got ideas ?
0	if you do n't use the printer on a daily basis , these cartridges dry up only days after you stop . given that the bjc-80 is a portable printer , i only use it while traveling , which means having to buy new cartridges for every trip . a real money drain
1	my high school is making us buy these calculators , and i want to say it is definately worth the price ! this thing works wonders , and it will do anything math-realated that you want to do ! ! ! ! ! ! i would strongly encourage you to buy this calculator . it also comes with a great unit converter and the periodic table , so it 's great for students like myself to use . buy this calculator ! ! ! ! ! you can also hook it up to your computer through a usb cable , so you can view your screen that is on the calculator , on your computer monitor , and you can back up and restore your ram memory
1	i was looking for a tv that offered bang for buck . so i knew samsung is the way to go . except my wife was not eager as i was , but soon after buying it the planet earth hd discovery channel show was on . now i can not get my wife to stop talking about hd . we love the tv not the best tv , but best for the price . nice design and easy to use
0	this vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad 's new tracheostomy . problem is , it puts out too much mist even at the lowest setting ! we 've tried everything including taping the hole , but it then goes from 'all ' to 'nothing ' because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through . of course it was n't until we started mentioning it to the various rn 's that come to take care of my dad that 'everyone ' using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem . so ... i 've resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad 's mask . not a great way to do it ( and just asking to be seeded by bacteria ) , but if anyone has a better suggestion , i 'm all for it , even if it means suggesting a different humidifier..
1	the card works great in my camera . no problems . i would recommend the product
1	if you 're an anti-commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over . if however you do n't like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard am/fm you might like this tuner . many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting hd signals . the quality of hd is most amazing on quiet passages in classical music , there is no noise at all , very quiet . you do notice ! the hdt-1 is quite sensitive . it will pull in stations that other tuners wo n't , and i 'm not even talking about the hd2 streams that the stations are starting to feature . clear channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with hd . their stations sound good and most of the fm 's are doing hd2 , a few have some interesting formats not heard on most am/fm stations . i hope the get even more adventurous . my only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get hd to lock in on am or fm . i do n't believe that to be a fault of the tuner , it 's the hd system and just like fm did i 'm sure it will improve ( ask someone over 50 about fm drift ) . i give it 5 stars , it 's not perfect but for the price it 's very good and for a first generation product i do n't think it could be better than this
0	i was very up set this walkman was a gift . it cost $ 90.00 6 months ago . it did not work right i could not get good reception at all it was complete static on all stations . i think it was defective because i always buy sony products , and they work great i still have the walkman my grandma gave me 11 years ago and it still works . buyer beware do n't buy walkmans from amazon on line . i susspect amazon may have sold me someone 's return item . although i ca n't prove it . you 'll be better off going to target or best buy . in case a refund is needed . shoppers check all your purchase 's with in a 30 day period so you wo n't get stuck with something that does not work . if i did that i could have got a full refund good luck frien
1	its great , i bought it for my husband and he loves it . the zen micro fit perfect
1	i 've never had a problem with these dvds . they burn and play perfectly and i 've never had a problem printing on them . what 's particularly nice about these is the printable area goes all the way to the hole . it does n't sound like a big deal but it makes for nicer looking dvds . by the way , i use an epson stylus photo r300 to print great photos and dvds
0	i ordered this product june 21st and am now told i should receive it by oct 28th . i would n't waste my time ordering this product from amazon
0	okay , this is not a review of the product itself . but , i strongly encourage you to consider not getting an n.e.w warranty . they are really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things . if you had anything to do with the device not working ( e.g . you dropped it , forget about it they aint gon na fix/replace it whatever . ) they have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in virginia ( of course you have to pay for the shipping ! ) lastly , they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an n.e.w warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know n.e.w will take months to pay them for the work they did . if you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it
1	i use only the best products , not refills or other manufactures as i have had problems with print cartridges that have ruined my printers . the hp ink jet cartridges are the best . i will always buy them
0	i purchased this mp3 player thinking it was a good purchase . boy was i wrong . creative labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware , software , or other products like this one . now having problems with the product is one thing , but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats [ ... ] . also when i ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned after i purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month . my mp3 player stopped working after 3 months , i did get it to work again . two months later the screen told me i had hardware problems . ok , so i download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem , no go . oh , and i forgot to mention that i am working in eastern europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone . save yourself some frustration and get something better . iriver maybe ? just stay away from creative lab products .
0	every other negative review here is accurate . the video connection is horrible . the mouse runs on a delay of 1-2 seconds and is unacceptable . try the competing kensington product instead . it 's more expensive , but it works . i switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly - in short , as advertised and expected
1	i went from the first version of the audigy2 to this . and it did increase my performace a tiny bit . my old card was going out on me . a lot of pops and clicks and games locking up with sound skipping . have n't had any of that yet . : ) i also did n't seem to have the mb problems that were stated in first review . i have a asrock dual-vsta ( new one made for windows : vista ) . with a good stereo setup this card sounds really nice . i have a older but really nice 5.1 with 100watts for each speaker . only 4 years old , but have seen some really nice ones lately . a lot of new games coming out have intense sound now . vanguards sound has crappy options so you ca n't dumb it down and it can drag a system down , esp one using on board sound . i would give this a 4 or even 3 star rating if it included amazons rating too .

0	did not work with my palm t|c right away . i 've not used this for any other purpose . i expect either palm or sd to release proper software to have it work with palm t|c
0	make sure you know that these will work with your camcorder before buying . apparently , they work fine with sony camcorders ( the packet too says so ) but not with canon . also , it 's incompatible with my new panasonic camcorder too . interestingly , it was displayed as a combo offer when i bought my panasonic camcorder , which is the reason why i bought it anyway , but got duped
0	i 've had these speakers for three years now . hissing , popping , not holding signal -- all that has been true from day 1 . and tonight , one of the speakers just would not turn on . the power supply was n't the problem -- it 's something inside the speaker box , and something that apparently can not be fixed . so my other one will be mono until i can come up with an alternative solution . oh well..
0	i love the saitek 880 wired gamepad . so i figured the wireless would be that much better . unfortunately , my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems . there 's nothing worse than the few times i really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out . i bought this and the batteries died . i sent saitek an e-mail and they sent me two new ones . great , they worked ! then they died soon after . hopefully their new wireless , which runs on one aa battery will not have any issues . however , this one 's a dud
0	i doubt that they are all this bad . maybe i just got `` lucky '' . the first time i put the tape in , the motor could hardly pull the tape . when i tried to record , it played back all shaky , like a playing a record off-center on a turntable . i returned it
0	the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case ; i ca n't believe the case did n't come this way -- and that 's just the start of the problems . the dials are fussy and it 's not easy to carry this radio , even in the case , without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you have n't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station . in minneapolis-st. paul , wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown . but that station has howitzer power . forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city . granted , i did n't buy this to listen to fm or shortwave . it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball . with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco , that wo n't happen , as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins ' new am radio home , or any othe am signal in the area . that 's really difficult to imagine , being other radios i own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area . if this is an example of grundig 's work , i 'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products .
1	i bought this cd player to use in my car and it has worked beautifully ! when you consider what a fine cd player it is , and the incredibly low price , it is most certainly a best buy !
1	i 've had this for about a week , and it seems to be working very well . the `` autoscan '' feature is very nice since i seemed to forget to switch between `` city '' and `` highway '' with my older units . the voice prompts are very clear , and the automute keeps the annoying beeps to a comfortable level . i 've had several radar detectors over the years , and this one certainly seems to be the best so far . it is also rated very highly in the amgazine articles i found
0	first few weeks it worked , and now we really needed it when driving in remotes areas , 3 hrs away from home through a snowstorm ... ... .it gave up working and we never were able to turn it on again , ... ... .we didnot take a map , as we were sure with this navigation system we would be safe..however we felt pretty unsafe and lost very frustrating and we are very disappointed with this recently expensive magellan navigation system , and with amazon as a usually depending sourc
0	please be aware of an important issue with this cable , even though it is recommended for the etrex gps series it will not fit their flat 4 pin connector . i had to return mine and bought one at the local rei
1	this memory card has not given us any trouble . very reliable product . highly recommend
1	it is very small and looks very cool.you can charge it very fast.ts sound is very good too.t has radio function too
1	i love my 2 gb sd memory card . i use it all the time and have had no problems with it
1	i have just up-graded to a 40 '' hd samsung 1080p tv so i had to replace my 2 yr old onkyo 601 `` great receiver '' with this 674 model mainly for the hdmi switching capabilities , set-up was a little tricky but after an hour i was ready to try the audyssey set up mic . which was very straight forward accurate boy was i blown away . this thing has such clarity separation i could n't believe the difference over my older onk.rec.i have direct tv hd-dvr panasonic 1080i dvd player via hdmi through receiver , do n't waste your money on those over priced monster cables , all of mine are 15-20 bucks from amazon . i am so pleased with my purchase i also feel this is a great value 599.00 i know their is not a better receiver out there at this price or even for 200.00 more . i would highly recommend this as the backbone to any quality home theater system . i read another review that expressed that you could n't turn it up past 60 , that is false i can crank mine up to max with with vertually no distortion
0	i ordered the a1500 and received the a1000 . i opted not to send it back when i read the other feedback on this page . i did n't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed ( as the other fellow did below ) . amazon is usually pretty good , not this time , and not on this product . if you want , you can call them at : 1.800.201.7575 ( toll free , us and canada ) 1.206.346.2992 or 1.206.266.2992 ( outside us and canada ) 1.877.586.3230 ( canada only ) uk customer service : +44.208.636.9200
0	the write up sounds good , with many options and features , but after closer examination i had to take it back . first thing , it appears that the front dv plug was an after-thought for panasonic , it 's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main av/s plugs are located . this is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit , retro fitting it in wherever . the tiny `` button within a button '' toggle switch for fastforward , reverse , etc looks like it 's glued on , it wo n't last long with normal use , and it 's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit . the menu interface is difficult to navigate . the remote control is horrible , a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features . you might want to pass on this one , remember the saying `` if it sounds too good to be true , it probabily is
0	like others , i was very pleased ( initially ) with the very quick installation of this router . since i am very familiar with linksys products , working through the web utility to configure the router is a snap . i was up an running inside 5 minutes . signal strength was awesome , and i had an imac connected wirelessly with wpa security and an xp machine connected through the ethernet port . life was good ... ... ... after a few days of blissful surfing , i tried to connect a mac powerbook pro to the network . bad idea -- would not connect unless the wireless security was turned off completely ( another bad idea . ) after resetting the router a few times it made the whole system very unstable . the imac now loses it 's connection every 15 minutes or so . soooooo , once again i 'm resigned to spending fruitless hours on a tech support line to a faraway land . i purposely stayed with 802.11g because this technology is several years old and should be rock solid . i found a forum at [ ... ] that proved to me that many others are having dhcp problems with these routers . there 's no excuse for having to spend this much time setting up a very simple network ! if i had n't already tossed the box , i would be returning it for a refund .
0	setting this unit up has been impossible , and i have not been able to use it . i have sought help of dlync website , dlynk phone support . the have not been able to work me through it . i have paid for a machine i can not use , have spent countless hours on phone and computer in trying to set it up . another person who has the same system with which i wanted to communicate has had the same problem and can not use hers
0	after the last panasonic 4-line debacle ... .1 key failes in 6 months on all handsets yikes ! and with not having a lot of other choices on the market we were forced to buy the new edition of the panasonic phone . how bad could it be , we figured . they have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now . well , the handset is probably ok , but when we took it 20 feet from the base we lost signa1 . what ! ! ? called panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery ... for heaven 's sake . hang up , call back , next person educates me that 5.8 ghz just means clearer signal , but range is shorter . wtf ? ? ! we immediately boxed this piece of junk up and sent it back ! ! do yourself a favor , buy from a different manufacturer
1	i love the sound quality and the way i am able to exercise and not notice that i have headphones on . the headphones do n't slide but i have had some difficulty adjusting them for a more snug fit . overall , well worth the money
1	first , i would buy it again if i needed to . this 15 '' takes up less space on the kitchen counter , i.e. , speakers are on the bottom . second , picture and sound are excellent , i.e , clear . i would not buy this item if i wanted a true vesa mount to monitor configuration . the stand , not the monitor , has the screw holes for the vesa wall mount . not enough or clear info in the description . however , it is just as easy to turn on the counter as on the wall . if you need counter space then buy something else .
1	i bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my nikon d70 and i 've certainly had no regrets . i have n't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write , but it 's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single-shot mode . the card is always ready when i am . downloading from the card to computer via my sandisk imagemate is fast too . i like it so much , i 'm buying a second one today
0	while the verbatim has burned well in 100 % of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players
0	since we bought this to work with our mac , we have had nothing but problems . if asked to print one page of a document only , it freaks out , all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down ! have had long sessions with hp customer service on the phone and they have n't a clue . if we could have been bothered , we would have taken it back , but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages ( at least we do recycle ) . there are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash , can never work out specifically what , we just sigh and reset it . will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon
1	the cheapest option i found at the time but an excelent pen drive . small and with a good style
0	my first and main complaint about this product is that it does not fit the 60gb ipod video . the 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb , and this case wo n't close around the 60gb ipod . a secondary complaint is that , though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb ipod from shocks , there is no protection for the screen . it 's just a hole in the case ( like the hole for using the wheel ) , and i just require more protection for my video ipod . a third ( minor ) complaint is that there 's a non-removable knob on the back of the case , for attaching the belt clip , and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket . i 'm returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen , too
0	when this jumpdrive was plugged into my windows 2000 system , the software that it loads corrupted the boot sector of my hard drive . the lexar `` technical support '' was no help at all . they told me to reinstall my system . luckily the computer repair person i hired was able to recover my data files before the os was reinstalled . lexar would not cover one dime of my repair cost . i will never purchase one of their product again
1	no problem whatsoever with this product . it was delivered in a timely manner and worked perfectly
0	i was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop . everytime i opened the lid a popping sound would occur . turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing . i took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed , same issue . i 'm not telling anyone not to buy this product . just be cautious.. and i hope you have better luck then i did
1	i ordered this product and it arrived 2 days later . it is genuine canon ink for a great price . i will definitely buy at amazon.com again
1	i exchange audio letters with friends , and this stereo recorder was purchased after my sony 100 dvs died and no replacement parts were available . the sound quality is perfectly fine , though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high-end machine . it comes with a stereo microphone , but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit -- as it is , there is a long clip-on cord . this makes it tough to do `` off-the-cuff '' recording . overall , a good value for the money . the other machine cost nearly $ 300 .
0	4 months into it and it stops playing , jams up and i ca n't remove the cassette or any or the cd 's ... ..wo n't ever but pioneer again
1	after doing some research and owning a cheaper shredder model , i decided to purchase this shredder . so far it was a wise decision . i have seen it elsewhere for a lot more money . i have been using it to shred up all my old and new personal documents and it is awesome . i put a kitchen garbage bag in the can and it keeps all the little paper pieces contained within the bag , and i can just keep reusing the same bag . it really is a smooth shredder and it keeps on working , no jams , etc . great buy !
0	this antenna is too directional dependent . almost always i have to re-adjust its orientation to obtain better reception on any one channel . in addition , if you live in an apartment very close to or surrounded by adjacent apartment blocks , forget about this antenna . given most of the previous reviews , it will probably work okay if you live in small buildings
0	i would not buy this again . the edge of the pouch impinges on the earphones connection and already wore out i set of earphones . the attachment to a belt is tricky to use , cant be done one handed and frequently unlatches when i am moving around . i am in the market for a better one
0	it was time to get a new cordless phone and i bought this because it was on sale , and featured hard number buttons -- i find it more difficult to dial phones with soft , squishy buttons . bad decision . you ca n't hear anyone even with the volume set to maximum , the answering system is just as bad in terms of registering voices , and apparently no one can hear me . i plugged in my headset to the jack , and they can hear me , but i ca n't hear them . there is static everywhere -- you ca n't use it in range of fluorescent lights , tvs , computers , speakers , etc . in a small house with compact fluorescent bulbs everywhere , try that ! this phone is worthless and if i can return it , i will
0	not only was this difficult to set up ( even a generally polite but sadly ill-informed technical helper from belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases ) but once i finally managed to get it to work ( by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip ) it had practically no range whatsoever ; in fact , my macbook pro placed within 2 inches of the router itself only received a 75 % signal , and once the threshold of the room was crossed , the signal disappeared altogether . a free four-year old linksys router which i received with my earthlink `` home networking '' package ( and which this belkin was supposed to replace ) always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed , and linksys is supposed to be notoriously mac-unfriendly . anyway , i hope that there are enough ups trucks in america to handle the returns that this item -- mine included -- will require .
0	when it worked , it did as described , but twice it stopped functioning and all data was lost . now when it is connected the computer fails to recognize it . there are many better , more reliable brands , such as the sony micro vault which i have now . nevertheless i would n't put anything on these that i did n't have backed up . these drives heat up if you leave them connected to the computer . heat will cause them to fail faster
1	seems to be good quality . has a strong rubber scent , and no cutouts for the 4 small buttons though
1	we 've had this printer for almost two years . i do a good amount of printing , both color b/w . while i do need to do cleanings more often with this printer , mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all . and it is very affordable . photos do n't always print well ... the only photo paper i have found to work well with my s530d was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when i bought it . no other photo paper has done well at all , so i suggest theirs . this is the best printer we have had in 10 years , and belive me i 've thrown my share out the window ! i can offer this advice to owners of any printers . always use the power switch on the printer to turn it on off , never use the power strip switch , or the switch from properties . for some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink ? i do n't get it , but i 've always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us . good luck ! jeanni
0	bought it for my wife - the pink just did n't match anything in my wardrobe ... she uses her player for the gym , and treats it somewhat rough . this `` case '' does n't protect the screen from scratches ( see most other reviews ) , but it has n't fallen off while she 's worn it , either . about 1/2 useful , really . on the other hand ... .it was cheap , right ? right ?
1	great price for a 128mb jump drive , works perfectt for my daughters college work , such a good price i bought
0	skull candy ear phones do look nice ... but it stops at that . within 2 seconds of putting them on , they hurt . the things are horribly uncomfortable and do not look or feel very solid . the sound was ok , but not great ... and not very loud even with the in line volume turned all the way up . yes they do look good , but head phones should sound great and be comfortable , looking good should be a bonus ... .not the entire sales point . i am very disappointed in skull candy . if you want good ear phones for a reasonable price , go for sony or senheisser . if you want a fashion accesorie ... go with skull cand
0	this printer prints fast but the quality is poor . consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree . pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer . i do not recommend this printer to anyone . i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet 932c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon . this purchase was a real dissapointment
0	i bought this cable , but it suffered from an unacceptable amount of interference . faint green and purple rolling bands ruined my picture . replacing it with a shorter cable fixed the problem . do n't buy a longer cable than you need , and consider spending a little more for a higher quality wire if you need all 50 feet
1	i totally love this cd wallet- it is not too big and not too small . the construction of this piece is very sturdy . i 've owned this for a while now and it still looks new . the color is a classic , the only problem i have with it is that the cd pockets are very flimsy other than that the exterior of this piece is unbelievable . i love it ! ! ! i actually bought another one , oh another note do be careful because the if you do n't handle the zipper with care it tends to get caught . but nothing major :
1	i , ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you `` must '' plug in . hey guys , try it without an outside energy source , i just hope i , m not gon na fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port . i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare , but no more pci slots , damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards , why do 2 of em have to take up so much room . oh well , trade offs are a bi -- - , but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice
0	as a musician who 's dealt w/ opening many cd packages for many years , let me save you some money . you do n't need a special tool to open cds . just run the bottom edge of the cd against any solid , rough surface ( like a sidewalk or concrete wall ) a couple of times . the plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie , allowing you to take it off effortlessly . getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the cd off is easy , too . again , no tools required . you 'll notice that the cd cover is `` hinged '' at the top bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back . it just pops in out , held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other . gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top bottom , then bend the whole thing back , toward the top of the cd case where the sticker is affixed , so that the sticker becomes straightened out . this will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece . ( try peeling the front cover off the sticker , rather than vice versa . ) and you 're done ! all you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy . the whole process takes under a minute , and you 'll still have the money in your pocket that you did n't spend on an iffy cd opening tool , to buy another cd with
0	i recently bought this thinking i could use it to upgrade my ti-86 calculator . to my surprise i heard it was incompatible with xp . i supposed the worst that could happen is that it would n't work . as soon as i recieved the cable it said to go to the website ... so i went and updated the software specific to my calculator . after the installation it asked me to restart . after the restart i immediatly recieved a blue screen of death and luckily windows xp found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that i would have to do a format . i have not fully installed it yet as now i have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100 % xp compatible and may mess up your system
1	the very first dvd player i bought was sony 's very first 5 disc dvd changer back in 1998 . it was an excellent player , but as the technology improved , it could no longer keep up . i upgraded to a single disc sony which could handle dts , and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video . but i always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start . at about one-third the price of that original dvd changer , this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player . it produces an excellent picture , has lots of tweakable settings , has more outputs , and is also very stylish looking . i do have a couple of nits , though . my original dvd changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc i wanted . with this one , i have to press a disc skip button to cycle through all the discs until i reach the one i want . the front of the player does have direct access buttons , though . i wish i still had my old remote control as i 'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality . second , the upscaling through hdmi produces a great image , but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p . in fact , upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture . it 's also unfortunate that while connected through hdmi , progressive scan can not be turned off . this should n't be an issue most of the time , but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off . progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote , but they can not be turned off when connected through hdmi . one last thing about the hdmi connection . there can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using hdmi connections and digital tvs . this is not a problem with the player , but with the way hdmi is currently implemented . this player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem . however , the audio-sync adjustment does n't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs . since i need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound , the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here . and that 's a shame . by the way , there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component , s-video , or composite outputs . there 's also a minor thing i 've found about all my sony dvd players that i have n't liked . they are unable to correctly display time remaining on certain discs , or more commonly on the special features ( documentaries , etc . ) on certain discs . i also have a cheapo philips player which has no problems displaying time remaining on those things ( even on the menu ) . it 's an improvement i 'd really like to see implemented on future players . now , despite the complaints i 've listed above , do n't get me wrong . this is still an excellent player and i really love it . i happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it . it really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances , and i feel it 's the best dvd player i 've ever owned . it 's just not quite perfect . in all likelihood , it 's also the last dvd player i 'll ever own as i 'll probably be buying a bluray or other hd player in a couple of years when that format war is over . but this is a great player to hold me over until then
0	but i wo n't because i paid good money for it . as you can see from the other reviews , the speed on this thing is pathetic , almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files . i had a small game on the drive , but it has tons of small files in the folder . it took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder ... makes you wonder if sandisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing . stay away.. or if you really want one , buy mine please
1	i purchased several of these cards ... . they work great and as advertised . the d200 has a memory buffer ... but these are still fast cards ! i have used them in the d70 as well .
1	this lavalier microphone works great and is very easy to figure out . well worth while if you 're trying to record an individual talking onto a camcorder
0	i have had various wifi networking solutions in my home and office for several years . while some linksys units have worked for me , more often i have found them undependable . in particular , the wps54gu2 set up fine , but i almost always had to cycle the power to get it to work each time i printed . not worth the hassle
0	buyer beware ! item was shipped with a short in the electronics and had to return . even though item clearly states that `` this is not returnable '' , i returned it anyway , only to receive more problems . stay away from this . i am refuting the credit card charges and plan on winning this one
0	this item will not work with pixma mp810 printers . none of the photo pigments are compatpable with this unit . i am now the proud owner of a cli-8pc ink tank that is completely useless to me . i suppose it 's my fault since , when i looked at these reviews several other people had the same problem . let all other buyers be aware and not make the same mistake
1	i purchased the adorama slinger bag after first purchasing the tamrac velocity 5 . the tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag . unfotunately , it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle . the slinger bag addressed both of these deficiencies . when worn as a waist bag , it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag . there are two water pouches on the slinger bag ( which is a real requirement as i live in arizona ) . the adorama slinger bag is a great travel bag . it is light weight and has great utility . i highly recommend it .
0	i was pretty excited about this player , having read about it in runners ' world . there are a lot of problems with it , however . while it is advertised as a sports mp3 player , in a lot of respects it is n't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports . my issues are : - headphones are not at all appropriate for sports , particularly running.. they keep falling off , so i had to invest in a better pair of headphones . kind of weird since it 's supposed to be a sports player . also , i spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before i could use them . - hard to change music while running , and it often ends up doing something i do n't want it to . you ca n't change the music without removing the mp3 player from the armband , which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you ca n't tell from any picture . - not easy to figure out the features of the player , such as the stopwatch , pedometer . also hard to use once you do figure it out . - software is a pain to use . - organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player . that being said , i still use it . there are some good features : - long battery life , recharges super quick - very cool-looking player - very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size . i would not recommend this player and if given a choice , i would not buy it again .
0	i installed this in my new garmin nuvi gps prior to making a trip to iowa city , iowa . thought that it would provide some information useful about the city and the surrounding area . found that there is not a single location in the memory that covers anywhere in iowa . this is advertised as a north american travel guide . did they move iowa
0	i purchased my 500 in september , it 's now january and it has never worked correctly at all . it would say that i am in russia , then lock up ( i live in nj usa ) . the first time that i sent it it , my expense , magellan support sent it back to me within 24 hours ; and it was not fixed . it still said that i was in russia and would lock up . the second time that i sent it to them , they sent me a shipping label via email . they had it in their paws for about 2 weeks . it came back said that i was in peru and then lock up . i have an old lowrance and never had a problem receiving a signal , it always locked on to my location ( albeit a little slow ) , and it worked . i 've been trying to get a new shipping label for this piece of junck now for one month . first they said that they sent it to me via email , but they said that because i have anti-spyware sw on my pc that my outlook is rejecting the label . but , i use web based email . then they said that they will send a label to me via regular mail . it 's been two and a half weeks and i have not yet received that label . they told me that they sent it out 3 days before christmas and that i did n't receive the label because of the delays in mail due to christmas and new year 's . but it 's now january . who knows , maybe i 'll be lucky and receive the label before 2008 . it 's clear to me that they have no intention of fixing this piece of junk . it was a mistake to buy it ; do n't you make the same mistake .
1	i had an optoma h27 but felt it was lacking the brightness i liked on tv , and i heard that hd72 was much better . so i returned my h27 to costco and got the hd6800 , which is costco 's version of the hd72 . wow , `` much better '' hardly describes it ! the brightness is incredible , and the detail and colors are truly remarkable . the other night , i was trying out different dvds just to see what they looked like on the new system , and i was totally blown away . while it does upscale dvd images to look better on its system , i also bought a sony upscaling dvd player and there is a significant improvement with it with the hdmi connection . i had read that since they are both upscaling , the dvd player 's upscaling would n't be necessary , but i do find the image through the upscaling dvd the best in a side-by-side test using two sony dvd players and two dvds of the recently restored `` carousel '' using component , s-video , and hdmi at the same time , all connected to the hd72 . i saw clearer detail on faces coming from the hdmi upscaling dvd player . i was so impressed , i felt like pulling in people from the street to see it , but i fought the impulse because i do n't want to share it with anyone . with a little tweaking of the menus , new films like `` star wars iii '' and `` sin city '' showed incredible detail , and older films like `` the adventures of robin hood '' were gorgeous in their technicolor glory . i highly recommend the hd72 .
1	i purchased 4 of these adapters ( 3 extra ) so i could hook up my macbook 's digital output for digital surround sound through my logitech speakers . the product works exactly as i expected ... great digital sound from my macbook . parts express did an excellent job of getting my order to me sooner than i expected ( ordered on a saturday , and they had the package to the courier by saturday night . ) very prompt service ... i would definitely order from them again . overall a great product from a prompt company !
0	when this adapter first arrived , i thought it was great . the sound quality was excellent , and free of all the distortion and interference i get from using an fm transmitter-style adapter ( there are few open frequencies in the sf bay area ) . the first day , i used it for about 20 minutes total ( did n't have far to drive ) , and it worked great . the second day i had a bit farther to drive . after about 30 minutes , it quit . has n't worked again since . i did n't expect it to last forever , but less than an hour ? yes , it has a 1 year warranty : just send the unit back with a money order ( $ 6 ) to cover the return postage . of course , then you 're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit..
0	when outsite temperature is around 0 celsius degrees or below , and the car and the unit it 's not yet warm enough the detector acts very strange , it gives sudden false alarm like k 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 55 5 0 0 0 , ku alarm 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 in spots where when it has normal temperature gives no alarm . and sometimes when on the highway , from nothing it gives a sudden alarm of strength 5 5 55 5 and then nothing my old cobra had no strange alarms like this one and it was smaller . the spiral coil it 's not good to short , you need a straight one maybe the scale would be better if it was from 0 to 9
0	after using these radios two months i can say that battery life is poor.a full charge does n't hold three hours.perhaps my batteries did n't come in good condition . i did n't use them on aaa yet ... 10 mile range is not true in a normal environment , open sea or desert perhaps.product works fine while battery las
1	this is one of the best products i have spent my money on . this speakers 'speak ' well and you will be amazed at how well they sound for that kind of size . also , the buying experience from amazon was excellent . i got mine deleivered in about 2 days . will recommend product for anyone else
1	this notebook case is a perfect fit for the macbook , and it is compact enough to fit into larger bags . it is exactly what i was looking for
1	this particular cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it , it will blow you away . i 've heard people complain about dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support , autually their tech support sucks but i do n't need them . this is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully . when you actually learn how to use it , you wo n't buy anything else for the price . if you are tech savey , you will really enjoy the product . i have nine cams installed at three locations . using their ip software you can view upto 16 at once . the reason i 'm back , on this site , is because i need to order two more . i did have to return my first one but it was a pre-production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear . dlink sent my replacement direct . the oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now . one last comment , the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50 % more with less features
1	i like it very much , i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather . i would buy kingston again
1	this is actually the second rcdw500c i have purchased . the first is still working , but it has so many miles on it that i wanted to have a back-up ready when it is time to be replaced . sony electronics , in my experience , are some of the toughest in the business . the old unit may last a lot longer . i am on my third sony tv in the last thirty five years ; the second is still working for the person i finally gave it to . i am very comfortable with the technology of the rcdw500c . once learned , this unit is a dream to operate . it is user friendly , displaying all of the info the user needs for optimum use . if you have questioins , the manual is well written , and will usually enable the user to solve any problems . sony is a very reputable company . in my humble opinion , sony has been out in front of virtually all of their competitors for a long time . their products have always been a good investment for me .
1	i saw this at the store and hoping to get it in 3 months my other reciever caught on fire and was a 19 year old yamaha rx-900
1	this is an awesome tablet ! it has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator , photoshop and painter . the pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse . the size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time .
1	this really works is very sturdy . the problem is the bolts they give is too heavy for light home projectors . just get 14inch screws from lowes you will be ok . the manual is not good
0	i experienced what seemed to be a common problem for many people that have purchased av cables for the ipod . i was able to get the audio but no picture was available despite following the advice of other reviewers to set my tv out signal to on . it did n't help that no manual was included in the box to assist with troubleshooting .
1	i compared it with low cost monoprice and high cost monster cable . i picked up 10 ' cable for about $ 70.00 from amazon few months ago . it 's been working pretty well . no complains so far and i like the thinness of cable .
1	the stick came in an excellent condition , and works perfectly . i recommend this product .
0	i 've owned the new v.3 product for over a week and have still not been able to unlock it for use . customer service is worse than i 've ever experienced . they wo n't commit to calling me back and have suggested that someone will be working on the problem and i should continue to keep trying the unlock process until it works .
1	this is just great . lots of storage for data files and pictures . allows me to keep my file with me where ever i go . no additonal software required , just plug it in the usb port and you have instant files , fast and easy to use . small in size but big in storage . i give it 5 stars
0	i loved these earbuds for 5 weeks , right up until they stopped working . the wires to the ipod ( the stationary wires , not the ones that wind up ) disconnected or broke inside the retractable casing . for a while it worked if i taped the cord so it pushed the wires into the case . but quickly stopped working altogether . too bad , they 're comfortable , the sound is fine ( great on the bus ) , and the retraction works good .
1	it 's a usb hub . all i ask is that it works . it does .
1	i have really bad luck with head sets ( i dropped a vise on my last set , really ) these are really well built headphones , it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad , but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set . they can get very loud and not crack , exceptional base , and mic is very very clear . they are light but feel solid , although i have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong . i have very big ears that is one of the reasons i bought this head set , it is very comfortable . the only thing i do n't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups , but maybe it help keep your ears cool , maybe . i really give them 4 1/2 stars . i paid about $ 90 for them and i have no regrets . so if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they do n't have mics but good headphones . hope this helped , good luck
1	there are some things i like about this , others i do n't . some people have written similar reviews , but i want to add my 2 cents . hope this helps potential buyers . likes : 1 . small , easy to use 2 . good sound quality 3 . good storage capacity for those of us who do n't have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers . 4 . some people have complained that the creative media software is hard to understand . i disagree , i found it straightforward . you can even change the titles , artists , and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player . yes , i realize this can also be done in wmp , but sometimes you want to edit later , or you missed something earlier . 5 . replaceable battery . if it dies , you can get another one , you do n't have to send it in to the company . dislikes : 1 . the shuffle mode is annoying . it does n't go through the entire playlist on shuffle . once a song is over , it goes right back onto the potential playlist , and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played , to the exclusion of the other items on the list . i want to hear all my songs at least once before i hear repeats . 2 . the creative media center software does n't install on windows vista . 3 . this is a hard drive player , so no running with it . that 's okay though for people like me : i do n't run . it also makes it cheaper than the ipod nano , which is a flash player . 4 . the cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer . i do n't like this because i 'm not always around my computer , i do n't lug it with me everywhere i go . however , there are ports you can buy ( here on amazon , even ) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports , so that 's handy . 5 . not as many accessories as the ipod , but not that important . 6 . you ca n't view your photos while you are listening to music . sometimes this sucks , but if you have a camera phone , or are in an actual conversation with someone , you probably wo n't be listening to your music anyway .
1	nothing much to report . they were as advertised and fulfilled my need
1	the sandisk reader is impossible to misuse . it loads quickly and it 's compact shape offers most options for memory . it can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet . i would prefer a little more weight so that it does n't move around on my desk so i 'm giving it only 4 stars . if i had to replace this reader , i would buy another sandisk
1	pros : like a quality piano , the keys give a sense of weight , the bend in the keyboard tool some getting used too but now am typing a full speed . the mouse offers great control , though i have n't much used all the buttons that are one the form . cons : the only gotcha is if the computer freezes , there is no way to control-alt-delete . also , setting the favorite keys to non microsoft items tends to reset after updates and restarts
0	i watch lots of show and some time wants to record good show while watching it also . if properly connected thru satelite dish to this unit and to tv , is this unit record the show while watching the same show on tv ? ( some of the units can not record while you are watching the show , tv has to be off ! ! ! ! ! !
0	this linksys stuff simply does n't work . and do n't try getting technical support - it 's a complete waste of time . if you ca n't google the solution , just take the stuff back . the adapter install took out my tcpip stack , even for my wired connection . it took me 3 full days to figure out that i needed to remove any sign of linksys , odyssey , and funk software from the registry , then remove and reinstall the tcpip stack . linksys support could n't even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days , a dozen emails , and 5 separate phone calls . linksys support is just embarrassing . do n't be caught having to depend on it
0	we had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam . we would get an error message , and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while . we finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program , after i had to ask to speak to a supervisor . ( the tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when i had already installed several before contacting them ) we have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again . the ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount , and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam . tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth , and for now the unit is working . we still have n't addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem . i hope hp reviews comments on this website occasionally . i would like them to know i have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years , but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position . also , hp tech support is very difficult to deal with at best . i talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible english . i am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported . hp are you listening
1	i use an i-pod mini in my car . it is in the center console where it connects to the auxillary input . i used to have to open the console to make changes or turn it on or off . the air click allows me to do all of that with the remote that i leave in a tray outside the console . it works just as it is supposed to with no problems at all . it solved my problem and i am a very satisfied customer .
0	these verbatim discs are hands down the very worst blank media i 've ever encountered ! they 're made by cmc magnetics -- well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world . but not only are they cmc magnetics , they 're the worst of the worst of cmc magnetics ! the latest kprobe *hangs* when faced with these , forcing a hard reset . the latest nero burning rom *hangs* when faced with these , forcing a hard reset . the program continues , non-stop , to display `` waiting for media '' when i use these , and an attempt to abort hangs windows xp sp2 the same way it hangs kprobe . curiously , the media ids on these are exactly the same as that on philips lightscribe cd-r media ( they 're made by cmc magnetics as well ) . however , at least the philips are recognized by all my software and hardware , quite unlike the verbatims . that 's why i say that these verbatim are the worst of the worst from cmc magnetics . ( the philips are no prize , either , but they perform minimally well ) . the *only* thing that worked with these media are the lightscribe labeling . but what 's the point of labeling discs you ca n't even recognize , let alone burn ? i had the exact same problems with these media in both my lite-on lh-201ah burner and my nec nd-2510a burner ( the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even low-quality media ) . note that verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by taiyo yuden . but , stupidly , they chose to go ultra-cheap and turned to the dreaded cmc magnetics corp . thus , they lost all credibility ! *avoid these like the plague ! *
1	theis is a small manuverable mouse . i especially like it for playing games since it is very quick . i had one before and i would buy another if this one quits
0	i purchased this to work with my xbox 360 , i wanted to try this cable type with my new onkyo 7.1 home theater since i was using the old composite for sound . i heard more disortion and fuzz then if you but a soda can in a blender . i qucikly ran to best buy to buy a monster fiber optical cable it was about 50.00 dollars more . but then the sound was incredible i could n't beleive what i was hearing . i gave it two stars since the cables build was so so but not half as thick as monsters . ( maybe i got a bad model give it a shot it 's only a couple dollars )
1	fast service and great price ! work great for about a mile or so but then i got them for shopping with my wife , she is at one end of the store and i am at the other
0	the cord design of these is terrible . you 'll have about 6 inches from the attachment point to your left ear and about 20 inches from your right ear to your attachment point . this is especially agravating for right handed individual ( pshh hardly any of those ) . why is this an issue because it really is only not awkward if you hold your mp3 player ( or whatever ) in your left hand as the normal cord is too short . i always use the extra extended cable , which makes the entire cable maybe a foot too big for ordinary use . the sound is good for the price ( does n't compare to my normal set of headphones ) , but sporadically i feel like they are hurting my ears ( not in a physical sense ) . i have a feeling this has to do with either improper wma encoding or ( more than likely as i 've never had this before with other headphones ) improper sound design of the speakers . question is though ... would i spend the $ 30 amazon asks for them ? yes , as they are definately the best in that price range , but do n't go to best buy or circuit city to get them as the price will be too high . i expected more from sony
1	i got mine for about 1 week ago to match with my mbp ( silver theme ) . someone mentioned about the light indications not showing as they should , or in the wrong way but mine works fine . cons : - light indicator shows exactly which usb ports are in use . - small in size - has usb port on top which comes in handy . - enough usb power- so far i did n't have to plug in the power charger yet . - comes with a usb plugged light . - comes with a extended usb cable ( for you to connect the hub to your computer ) - the usb plug is silver + transparent in color which looks kinda nice . prons : - it camed with some minor scratches on the hub 's surface although i just took it out from its sealed package carefully . those surface scratches are n't too noticeable . ( did n't want to return it and waste time money ) . - as many have already mentioned , the usb cable is connected to the hub permanently . other thoughts : - the usb cable connected the the hub is pretty thin . it 'd be a good feature ( look less noticeable ) f you treat the cable nicely , but if you are harsh on the cable , it feels like it may break . will be great if this hub has firewire ports , but i 'm very happy with this item
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports . in my case , i had plenty of ports , but needed an extension cable , which would help me in plugging the flash drives , whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires ( i keep my cpu , under the table ) .the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough . overall good value for price
1	i have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises , but it works nonetheless , and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house , i figure i ought to be grateful that it works at all . i do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections , but i suspect it 's related to where i have things in the house , no so much the product . in fact , i can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up . install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine . it 's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed . ca n't complain , especially for the price
1	mvsv3 gives excellent color with a vivirant and vivid feel . deffinently a high porformence wire in its class , and worth the buy
1	never a better caluclator in existance . used it all thought calculus classes and computer science . it does everything . fast , smooth , pretty print flawlessly and more memory then a herd of elephants . even does 3d graphing excellently . spherical trig ? not a problem at all and fully graph it , slice it up and zoom in . also a few sites on hacking the ti-92 plus that you can google for anyone intrested
1	this is my second one of this model , i burned up the first myself when we moved and i accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it ( too much voltage = smoke ) . i found it easy to configure , set up wep keys , mac locked everything using the web-based interface . it worked great with our linksys media extender - we watch recorded tv from our media center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device . no problems whatsoever . has n't slowed down my internet connection either . i am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work .
0	i bought this alarm clock today ( april 7 , 2007 ) at bed , bath and beyond for $ 10 . i wish i had seen the reviews first . i bought it because of the product name , small size and variety of options . unfortunately , i realized it was n't a great buy when i brought it home ... and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clock would stay on . the connections appear to be very sensitive and the battery does n't stay in place . the clock light is pointless . it 's supposed to help you see the time in the dark , but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry . actually , the screen is blurry in most positions even with the light off . as for the alarm , it 's pretty quiet . if you 're a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment , this is not the clock for you . you 'll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear . a final note on this product : the clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems ... but only with the battery cover slightly open . if i close the cover all the way , the clock shuts off . if you want an alarm clock that will last awhile , i suggest buying something else . you get less than you pay for with this model .
0	although these labels were functional , i was disappointed as the paper is far thinner than for similar labels i had purchased previously , and these tended to tear easily
0	i bought a netgear wg311t wireless card to replace one from another manufacturer that had failed . first , i coudl n't get a connection to the router . two conversations with tech support in india produced the information that i had to download a new driver for windows xp-sp2 from the internet . i installed the new driver , which allowed me to connect to the router , but not reliably to the internet . a third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that i change my web browser ( i 'm using ie ! ) instead , i bought a linksys card , which worked straight out of the box . do n't buy this product ! if you 're not convinced , go to the netgear user forum and read the horror stories there
0	luckily , i did n't pay a penny for the motorized skipdr . as it was given to us as a `` prize . '' i have the original ( manual ) skipdr . which worked every time , and i always end up using it instead . it has more than paid for itself in repaired cd 's -- $ 20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang . the motorized version did n't come with any deep scratch sanding pads , which i need about 25 % of the time for a badly scratched disc . most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine , and wo n't start turning , so i have to squeeze it together to make it work
0	i do n't want to rate this product , since i have n't used it . i had to , though ... i just wanted to share with everybody that this product still does not come with a charger . i received them , left them unopened upon not seeing a charger , called customer service ( they did n't do anything about the posting ) , and sent them back . a waste of time and effort and extra hassle and waiting to get the money back . do not get mislead by pictures or descriptions
1	i hva tried alll kinds of stuff on the ipod , and this is th eonly one that got rid of all the scratches . thanks for a fantastic product
0	i tried 4 dvds with different dvd writers and still does n't work . this stuff is junk . in addition , the manufacturer never sent the rebate . do n't buy anything from velocity
1	i did a lot of research , not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later . i was about to buy the newest 40 '' 720p samsung for $ 1899 ... then i stumbled upon this one at circuit city for $ 1999 and bought it on the spot ... paid about $ 50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later . i 've had it a week now , and i love it . standard-definition picture quality is just okay , but are any of us buying these tvs to watch sdtv ? i get about 15 hd channels through my cable company , including all four major networks plus espn , espn2 and a couple music and movie channels . therefore , a majority of everything i watch is available in hd anyway . sdtv content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet . hd content looks awesome ( including black levels ) , and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p . i can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available . i 'm going to wait another year or two for the high-definition dvd format war to play out before i buy a blu-ray or hd-dvd player . but i 've watched standard-definition dvd on my xbox with this tv , and the picture is beautiful . i 'm sure high-definition dvd would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison , but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition dvd on this tv . in short , this is an excellent tv , especially compared to other 1080p models in its size range . if you 're looking for something in the range of $ 2000- $ 2200 , this is the one you want . enjoy
1	remember back in the day when cds first came out ? i do : hi-fi shops and all my male relatives proudly did these demonstrations of scatching a cd , putting it into a player , play *presto* the disc played . well , either they were making bomb-proof players back thens or the laser never got to the scratched bit of the disc because i used to have piles of discs were handled carelessly and did n't play . yes , you read correctly : i used to have stacks of unplayable discs . if you do n't read any further , you can stop at the end of this sentence : skip dr works ! here 's the short of it 1 . i have my own multination consulting firm 2 . i have worked with computer in the media and creative industries for over 20 years 3 . i dislike misleading reviews 4 . i dislike wasting my time looking for products that work 5 . i dislike being lied to wasting my money and 6 . i dislike people aggressively selling me stuff that they have little knowledge about frankly does n't work on top of that , i am impressed neither by people that trash products that do work nor people that work for certain manufacturers , create ghost profiles and trump up their employer 's products . skip doctors works . i own over 3,500 discs . out of that number , i had countless discs -- from my beloved trance planet disc , a jessye norman classical and spirituals collection , stuff by miles davis , reams of and nina simone compilations to computer program discs , backups of various creative projects , rare sacds ( superaudio cds ) and stuff that got mangled at parties or being dragged around the world before creativelabs and ipod came on the scene -- that were all unreadable . i have seen the sprays , i have seen the wipes , i have seen the low grade sandpaper product , i have tried using brasso metal polish ( a remedy recommended by a friend of mine from venezuela -- and for little scratches actually works ) and low-grade industrial solvent . hands down , short of the industrial strength polishing machines ( that handle 500 plus discs at a time and go from $ 1500 to over $ 5000 ) , skip dr ( and all its incarnations game dr / dvd dr / photo dr ) works . period . why did i only rate the product '4 stars ' ? simple : this review is about the mechanical version of the product . and i am lazy : mechanised means effort . will i buy the mechanised version ? definitely ! the product is in my shopping basket will be ordered ( when i finish writing this review to set the record straight !
1	this 23 '' lcd hdtv has excellent image quality and looks really stylish , too . it also comes with hdmi so you can hook up the latest hd video source such as hd-dvd or blue-ray hi-def dvd players . the lcd panel itself displays vivid , evenly-lit images , and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model . i personally ended up opting for the sharp ld-23sh1u hdtv lcd monitor because the sharp works as pc/mac monitor ( plus j started offering a $ [ ... ] rebate ) . but i think this panasonic is a great choice , too , no doubt about that
0	i ordered this , as i have many items from amazon and had not received it after 2 months . i cancelled the order
1	have only used it a couple of times in a month , and feel like i 've already justified the low cost . - should be fine for my intermittent use
1	i checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case . what i received is what i expected . lots of compartments to store needed accessories , sturdy construction , pleasant appearance . as with a previous review , my only citicism is the shoulder strap . while it is comfortable when used , it is also fixed and can not be removed . i 've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane . other than that , it was a good purchase for the price
0	i have an hp pavillion ze5000 series laptop . my laptop hardly fits in this bag . the battery holder is also too small . practically unusable . very disappointed with the product
1	got this drive a few weeks ago for an apple power mac g4 cube . the g4 cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious . thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed . this drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is . unbelievable . do n't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep . disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6-8 inches from the cube and is totally non-existent more than 12 inches from the cube . will not hesitate to buy seagate barracuda drives for all future machines . the 5-year warranty is a winner . highly recommend this drive for its silence , speed , cost and warranty
1	like the other guy , not much can be said . works . works well . end of story . the only thing i would have liked to see was integration of sorts into a pci slot or something , to keep it within the case
1	i really do n't have much to say about this book holder , not that it 's just a book holder . it 's a nice one . it does it 's job . it 's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic . it 's strong , sturdy , and it 's big enough , even for those massive heavy textbooks , like the calculus ones . although , i would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that 's like 6 '' thick ( even though it still may hold ) . it 's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place , although those tend to fall off when you move them . but that 's no big deal . just put them back on . this book holder is kind of big , and i would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom , but it 's not too big . you should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time .
0	i bought this card for my tj25 , supposedly a supported device . but the problems with this card make it nearly useless : - it comes with a web browser that does n't work . - even if the browser did work , it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version . - the only downloadable browser that works with the card is eudora , which does n't do anything except display text ( you ca n't even fill in web forms with it , so webmail , searches , etc . are impossible ) . - the card is designed to work with netfront and clie mail , software that comes with internet-enabled clie devices ... obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card . these programs are not available separately . - the card would n't connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors ' , even though my powerbook has no trouble connecting to either , no additional configuration required . - while attempting to connect , the card would often stop responding , and then lock up the handheld . bottom line : if you want a web-enabled pda , buy a web-enabled pda . do n't buy this
1	according to other reviews , this radio compares favorably with others in its price class . as a ham radio operator i can say i am very happy with the e5 . it is the best portable broadcast band radio i have ever had . it is the best portable shortwave radio i have ever had . i was particularly interested in ssb capability . it works well . i called about the noisy power supply and they are sending me the improved replacement . i use 2100 mah nimh batteries which i charge externally . i have two sets . the radio works well with these . i found that the internal antenna by itself , indoors , is not enough . i used the included wire antenna with moderately good results . but more convient is using the telescoping antenna . this antenna works , according to the manual , for fm and sw only , but i found that extending it fully , is effective in all cases . ressults using this method were similar to the wire . holding the radio and using the headset may also improve reception . hams know that the antenna is a critical part of any receiver . there are limits to what is possible in a package this size . i have not tested it with a tuned outdoor antenna . for what it is , this is a great tool . it is a convient size and easy to program and use . it more than meets my expectations . [ ...
1	firstoff , that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong . let me explain how this works . the soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like itunes ; it has its own proprietary format that is really just mp3 with a different file extension title . when you import your mp3s into the soundstage library , it makes its own duplicate library of your music in a new directory using its 'omg ' file suffix . yes , omg . i think that 's funny , and you should too . the minidiscs themselves are essentially just cd-rws . keep this in mind . they are enjoyable cheap to buy more , they are rewritable , and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd-audio , or close to 4/5 hours of 'low bitrate ' audio , which is just compressed mp3s . the product itself is very good . i 've had one for a short while . i bought an eight-pack of disks right after i got it , and filled them with music . i have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc-swapping of five-hour playlists is far less irritating than my old cd-player method ; cd-swapping with 70-minute albums . the controls are very simple and effective . grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate , but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio-cd . its impeccably shockproof , and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight . the hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light . i got this as an alternative to harddrive mp3 jukeboxes . most mp3 players over a gig in capacity are hd storage , which is far less durable ( in my experience ) than simpler players . rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that i would have to swap on my computer constantly , i got the minidisc player and can simply take other disks with me . its a solution that suited me well
1	i bought these as a gift for my husband to watch tv late at night without disturbing me . he loves them . the sound is fine and the headphones are comfortable .
0	i bought the archos 600 mostly for the picture- and video viewing and sharing ability - the large screen and good portability seemed ideal to share photos and videos with friends and family . the device did n't disappoint - also has coolness factor going for it with the sleek design and easy navigation . my opinion quickly changed when i ran into connectivity problems a few days into using it . while i was able to download and synchronize ( via windows media player ) easily the first couple of times the device all of a sudden was n't recognized as a usb device anymore and also froze the `` external hardware '' management function on my pc . right now i can not even connect using it simply as an external hard drive , and so far customer service at archos has not been able to help me , blaming the problem on driver issues on my pc ( seems to defy logic - works fine first and then without warning stops ) , a really frustrating experience . seems like this is along the lines of problems that another reviewer experienced , so this may not be as isolated as i thought .
1	works well for my mac and bt enabled sony ericsson phone . other than the built in drivers for the printer in mac osx , support for options within the card and printer are non-existant . still cant figure out how to manually force a realignment of the cartridges..
0	i bought this adapter because i could use the cable that came with ipod , ( one fewer thing to carry ) . well , about six months after opening this item , i noticed that my ipod was running on battery . one of the contacts had broken , and the device was not working anymore . i am disappointed , but should have expected that for the $ 10 i spent .
0	the product description in january 2007 is inaccurate : batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours , not 60 ; there is no hands free speakerphone ; if you use a standard plug-in headset , the microphone does not work ( tested two units ) . there is more : the headset is very loud ( you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear ) , but there is no volume adjustment ; the microphone has low sensitivity , so you find yourself yelling into it ; the clock resets itself when the power is turned off . i returned mine
0	i 'm the consumer of sandisk usb flash drives . i have used couple of sandisk flash drives ( i.e . 512mb mini , 256mb mini ) before i bought this product . performance wise this particular product is not doing good . it 's taking long time to copy files from my computers . even it 's taking long time to delete files from this disk . so i returned to amazon and looking for mini products from sandisk . i doubt all the micro products which is having capacity more than 512mb . now i 'm planning to buy 512mb or 1gb sandisk mini usb flash drive . better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product
0	my daughter bought this for me so i could see my grand children who live in other states . i have spent 6 days and almost $ 450 trying to get it to work . i even hired a computer repairman who charged me $ 184 and could not get it working . if it was not a gift i would send it back to get my money back . i called the help line , lots of times and usually got someone who did n't speak english very well . they would end up telling me it was a problem with the router . then i would call the router and they would tell me it is a problem with the d-link . no one wants to take responsibility for getting it working . i even went on the support page on the internet and read pages of things that could be wrong . tried them all in six days and i still do n't have it working and has cost me alot of time and `` money '' . good luck if you buy it you will need it
0	other than the power switch is not easy to see , the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality not that good . use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you . even using it for church meeting recording , you would not get excited for its sound quality . if you can tolerate the size of sony ecm-ms907 , you may like the sound quality of that microphone . if you like a small lapel microphone with true voice , try the akg wms-40 wireless system . our people are much happier with the akg wireless microphone than this one .
1	wonderful for those who type and work with computers alot -- soft and comfortable ! i have n't had any problems with carpal tunnel since ! it did n't have a nasty smell as other reviewers stated . a great buy ; saves me a lot of pain
0	i wish i never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks . if you put a textbook on it and turn the page , it collapses and or tears the page . i would n't even use this for a notebook .
0	this remote is so hard to use and setup . the xpress functions do n't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time . most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons , instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers . get something else
0	have a second generation ipod ? if so , this is not the product for you . after buying my new green ipod i needed something to protect it , so i bought the `` speck nano skintight delux with holster . '' it just did n't fit it . i tried , but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off : do n't do this . i sugest making sure the product detail includes the `` second generation .
0	at the beginning , i really thought this is a very nice product . it does solve the cd organize and automatic storage problem for many people . however , this equipment is poorly engineered . i bought four units and all of them failed within a year for various reasons . there is no easy way to even take the discs out of the faulty units . if you ever think about move this equipment to another room , it is almost bound to fail . customer service usually take 2 days to respond . the phone service guys do not answer questions about disc stakka because they know this is a bad product and rather not to deal with it with the disappointed customer . imagining someone charges your $ 400 to organize 300+ cds for a year and then quit . i am completely pissed off .
1	this is my second iriver product . the first one was fine but it could n't survive a trip through the washing machine . this one works well , is easy to navigate through , good sound . the case is rather cheap . the other one was rigid plastic . this case is hard to use and makes it difficult to change the batteries . the software leaves something to be desired so i use windows explorer to add songs and rearrange the order . all in all , this is a great little mp3 player
1	these cases are amazing ! ! i love them ! ! if i ever need to replace one of my dvds i always buy memorex dvd storage cases . there the next best thing , i think to the ones that come orignal with my store bought dvds . thanks memorex !
0	this is the worst phone that anyone could ever buy . there is constant static and clicking in the background , making it hard to hear the person on the other end . to make it worse it only has room for 10 programmable numbers and only two choices for ringtones , both obnoxiou
0	just a heads-up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides . you will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them . given the verbiage on the box , it caught me as enough of a surprise that i returned the scanner . i 'm not ok with deception like that
0	i have used this type of inexpensive wireless mic before and the others i tried had much better sensitivity . you have to touch this mic with your lips to be herd . there are better choices even in this price range
1	i needed something to hold my ipod while i skateboard , and this works like a charm . never moves an inch . can get a litle uncomfortable if sweating a lot
1	good sound and comfortable for the price . like the fact that the cord is on one side and does not go around you neck
0	i was ( wrongly ) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo . be sure your computer is supported , because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing , so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer . so amazon , as usual , graciously took it back . love amazon . i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work
0	the card works and produces a reasonable image , but the `` catalyst '' software used to drive the card is lacking/buggy . to make work , i had to disable the scsi cd burner in the system ( or the software would hang for several minutes before working ) . the sofware is slow to open/respond , beyond that the ability to size the tv window is very limited . this card replaced a standard tv card in my system that i bought for $ 25 . i used the old card more because it would open quickly and i could resize the window to be small ( non intrusive ) while i was working on other things . on the plus size , i can expand the hdtv card to larger windows while retaining a good image
0	this transmitter requires me to remove the case from my ipod 5g . even with the case removed the device does n't fit snugly and works it way loose as i am driving . the sound is fair even though the area where i live has many unused stations . i would think it would sound much better than it does . poor quality product ; has too many flaws to justify the high price . i 'm very disappointed and i 'm returning it
0	i use this in conjunction with the sandisk ultra ii 2.0 gb compact flash card . i like it , but the flash card does n't slide in easily . sometimes it get stuck halfway , as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins . to add insult to injury , both the reader and flash card are manufactured by sandisk . therefore , they should work seamlessly together , but pathetically , they do n't . i 'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great , rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing . for comparison , my camera accepts the card perfectly . there is no give at all , but instead is an effortless process . not a quality reader . other than that , it works as expected . surprisingly , the reader does n't topple over as easily as i thought it would . it stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in . sliding the card in a 2 handed process , so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in . removing the card is extremely easy . that 's a one-handed process . `` eject '' the card from the pc 's drive and then remove it . data transfer from the card to pc is very quick . overall , i 'm glad to have it , but it 's an annoyance to use it . i hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader
0	the toshibamd14f52 arrived defective . some channels would not function properly - ghost images and snow on screen . we have direct connect cable with 5 other tvs that work perfectly . toshiba customer service was horrible to deal with ; they were evasive , would not listen to my explanations but insisted on telling me to try what i had already tried to make the tv work . they also told me to call my cable company for help . finally , after talking to several different unhelpful and unfriendly toshiba people , i was referred to a tv repair agent for toshiba that turned out to be unsavory , dishonest , given to lying and refusing to demonstrate he had fixed the tv as he claimed . he refused to plug it in to show it worked . well , as i suspected , when i got home and tried the tv , he had left the tv as non-functional as it was when he received it , but insisted it was fixed . he told me to buy an external tv antenna and not use my cable tv ! i will never buy another toshiba tv again
1	this is extremely high quality photo paper best used in canon photo printers . the 13 '' by 19 '' is used best with the canon i9000 printer series , with a web of 13 '' . this paper resists moisture damage and has archival quality .
1	i am very pleased with this item . it is fits comfortably , holds my cd player snugly and has room for my id , keys , extra batteries cd 's
1	i bought this mouse for my fiancee about three months ago and she has not complained once . she uses it extensively in her office and reports that it is accurate , comfortable , and looks sharp
0	i bought these thinking they were a good deal but now i have to agree with some of the other reviewers . i bought 24 of these and one year later i have four left that will take any sort of charge . the ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each . i also have several high end chargers that do n't want anything to do with the ones that died . on the bright side i have several lenmar dlcrv3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been a+ after 2+ years
1	the mounting kit installed easily and is holding a pair of bose 151 speakers . it works well for what i need
1	how can you go wrong with a price so low . they 're good for both parents and kids to use . not to mention they 're easy for young kids to operate ! keep in touch
1	they are everything the other reviewers said they were , and i , too , ca n't wait until the printing is darker and in color ! wish it did n't take so long to print and hope the darker images and color only require an upgrade
1	the item works as i expected . i received within the tiem offered by the seller . i 'll buy again from this merchant
0	once again i 'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product . these are terribly uncomfortable ( for my ears ) and do n't really provide that great of listening experience . the frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible `` surrounds '' , and then they become distractingly uncomfortable . but of course , this is just my experience , your mileage may vary , as they say . personally , i found my apple ipod 'phones to be better
0	either the item is faulty or my television is too old but it didnt work for me . i needed to use the component from vga to avoid taking up my s video and dvi openings on ym video card and the television never picked up the signal . instead if you have a component open for video just use the s video converter not from this item .
1	this one of those products your girlfriend wonders why you are wasting your money on , that turns out to make life so much easier . it has allowed me to leave my ipod in my backpack on my way to work , and go through security to get into work , all without having to open my bag . the remote has a velcro strap that i use to attach to the shoulder strap of my back pack . i am able to start and stop tunes and change the volume without needing to pull the ipod out . my only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap . as the device is made for active people it would be nice to know that everything would stay connected , because when things do come undone , you do have to open your bag and put it all back together and that defeats the point of having the air click .
0	the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case ; i ca n't believe the case did n't come this way -- and that 's just the start of the problems . the dials are fussy and it 's not easy to carry this radio , even in the case , without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you have n't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station . in minneapolis-st. paul , wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown . but that station has howitzer power . forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city . granted , i did n't buy this to listen to fm or shortwave . it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball . with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco , that wo n't happen , as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins ' new am radio home , or any othe am signal in the area . that 's really difficult to imagine , being other radios i own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area . if this is an example of grundig 's work , i 'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products .
0	i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness ( & lt ; 100 % ) . just scheduled an exchange lcd
1	actually , i loved the philips acoustic edge , an earlier and internal sound card , but it did not like my older dual-processor system . because of that i was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper-threading - which windows treats as dual processors . i bought the aurelium instead . i love this thing ! i am a bit of an audiophile , and this sound card is just perfect . with my klipsch computer speakers , it makes a perfect combination
1	i already test a loot of mobo ... asus , msi ( my last was k8n diamond ) , and others ... but this board looks like no other , and realy works ! ! ! for gamers is the ultimate board ... i really recomend it !
0	i bought this dvd recorder because it was one of the few that recorded onto virtually every format . plus , it 's a sony , and i 've never had any problems with sony before . the recorder works intermittently . it recorded a few hours worth of shows , then it would corrupt the disk , rendering it useles ( abaout 2/3 of the time ) . i thought maybe it was the media , so i bought sony media ( this time it only corrupted the disk 1/3 of the time ) . i sent the product to sony for repair and `` they could not duplicate the issue '' so they sent it back . the sony repair service center is located in south texas , where the labor is cheap and it shows . i got my unit back , and on the 2nd disk , it failed ! ! now the door is jammed and i ca n't take the dvd out . do n't buy this product . i 'm buying samsung from now on
1	price is excellent . no problems but i falls below a 5 star due to product lacking higher quality materials .
1	i did n't want to fork over 500 for a bose or boston acoustics , or even 350 for a cambridge soundworks , and then i found this little gem , for about 175 + shipping . i 've had it for a few days , and so far i am impressed . the sx functions are very intuitive , easy to set the time and both alarms . i thought it was extremely innovative to have the button that sets the time located inside the cd player compartment , no more accidentally changing the time instead of the alarm ! the alarm buttons themselves will illuminate when they are activated , which is great . the buttons themselves have a nice click when you press them , and the cd , am/fm tuner , and aux buttons will glow when they are active . the volume control and tuner knobs are recessed , but this keeps the player from having any unsightly bulges i suppose . the snooze/sleep button is a good size . the sleep function can be toggled for 90 , 60 , or 30 minutes . the range of the speakers is great when you consider the size of the sx . the speakers measure about 2.5 inches , and with the volume turned up , you can definitely feel the air being pushed out of the bottom of the unit . i like that it has adjustable bass and treble , which can vary from -5 to +5 . i have the bass set to +3 and treble to +2 and it sounds great . it does n't have the range of say a home entertainment system , but definitely rivals my sony bookshelf system . the mp3 player on the sx could be better , but is adequate . during playback , the lcd will scroll to display the filename , title , artist , and track . it can be programmed for up to 64 tracks , but i have n't had the time or patience for this . instead , i just numbered the mp3 tracks in the order i wanted before burning them to the cd-rom . the repeat function works well , and you can choose either to repeat one track , repeat all tracks , or repeat just one folder . however , the shuffle function is rather limited , as it has only one setting which is to randomly play an mp3 from any of the folders ( resulting in less than desired combinations of music ) , and it stop playing music after each song from all the folders has been played once . one of the things i looked for in a clock radio is an auxilliary input mini-jack , and it also has a jack for headphones . i have my laptop on my nightstand right now , and it playing mp3s on winamp sound great plugged into the sx . there are only 2 levels of brightness for the backlit lcd . the default level can not be changed or dimmed , and is rather bright in a dark room.. it will make everything glow . takes a little while to get used to , but is not say brighter than a typical nightlight i guess . it is a bit hard to read at night because the numbers are so small , and the brightness of the lcd can kind of drown out the analog display , but then again i wear glasses so i suppose i have nothing to blame besides my bad eyes . when the radio or cd player is in operation , the dial becomes significantly brighter but it can be toggled to the lower/default level with the dimmer button on the remote control . one other thing about the unit was the lack of a battery backup , and you will notice this is the case with many japanese units , including the sony clock radios . i guess the power grid in japan is really stable , so they do n't have use for this , but still , it would be nice if there was an option for a backup 9 volt battery . on the other hand , i was informed by teac tech support that the unit does contain a capcitor which will retain the time and alarm for `` up to 3 hours '' . i have n't had the time to test the maximum threshold , but i can say that i did unplug the clock for about a minute , and when i plugged it back in , sure enough the time and alarms were still correct . overall i am really impressed by this unit . the only thing that could be better is if the mp3 player shuffle had a few more options , but i guess this is ok as many i have seen mp3 clock radios without any shuffle function at all ! also , i wish the lcd backlight could be adjusted a little more . it is a bit pricey at just under 200 , but i have heard many clock radios , and you would have to spend 350+++ to get anywhere near the sound quality of the teac sx
0	the unit was 20ft from the receiver , in the same room , in direct view of eachother ... tivo would n't connect
0	the 3m privacy filter does not work unless you are at a 50 degree angle or more to the screen . otherwise you can see the screen . you can see the screen clearly from any distance if you are directly behind it . all the filter does is make the screen a little darker . do n't waste your money
0	these cards only work with camera that supports the write acceleration ! ! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12x card . there is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality . i have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting write acceleration ! ! very few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity ( 12x ) at 1/4 the mentioned price . so why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !
0	can capture analog video and produce cd-rom 's but i expected the ability to produce dvd
0	i ordered the 2-year service plan on may 1st , this day ( july 31st ) , i still have not recievied it . i have contacted them a number of times , and still nothing . do not buy from this company
0	i have two ni-mh chargers and sony batteries wo n't charge in them . they probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers . they force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably wo n't again charge other brand batteries . and of course this is not mentioned anywhere . no wonder these batteries are the cheapest . do n't waste your money or support sony 's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market . soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough
0	this is a good product . not as good as an mp3 player with internal memory , as it is bulkier . but , it is great for the price . the only drawback is , it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory . running with it can be uncomfortable at times ... if you are a runner , you may prefer a smaller mp3 player , one you can put in your shorts pocket ...
1	i 'm very happy with this desktop system . great sound , great reception , great price
0	this is the same unit that hp sells , but has lite on do its support . great unit for about a month . support is not good .
0	after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement . of course you want a hard copy , that is why you bought it . just do it .
1	i purchased this microphone for my 6 year old daughter to replace a microphone to her karaoke machine that the dog chewed up . this mic was inexpensive and works fine so far . we have n't had it very long so it has not really been put to the test of time
1	i was very pleased with the improvement of picture quality ( colour and clarity ) over the standard playstation cable . anyone with an s-video input should consider making this simple upgrade
0	viewing the internet this monitor was great . when i tried to play a movie , dvd disc , mpeg , avi , anything . the picture was terrible . very bad pixilation . i was told it might be the video card . i bought a new card xfx geforce 7600 gs , for another $ 150.00 . same quality on films . i tried latest driver from xfx , from nvidia , etc . changed screen resolutions , everything you could think of , i tried . the picture for viewing movies was terrible . i hooked my old 15 inch monitor back up , the picture quality for movies is great . i have returned this monitor , now i have to wait for a refund before i will try a different monitor . the black light bleed is very bad . if you watch films on your monitor , you ca n't help but notice it . ps . amazon was great about refunding shipping . amazon is the best online store there is
0	for $ 99 this should be a much better remote . if you watch movies in the dark , you have to use the glow button , guess what , you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least . also , logitech has over simplifed the remote . you ca n't program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly . if you have to go into the device menu a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume . why not have an option to program each button period ... but the remote is useless now because of the low battery life . do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month . ridiculous . only remote i have ever had like this
1	i did a bunch of research before i bought the a2 . the things that sold me on it were : 1 . battery life . 2 . it 's got a voice recorder encodes direct to mp3 3 . i love the fact that it 's `` folder view '' , all my music on my pc is organized by artist then album anyway , so it 's just copy and paste to get it onto the a2.which leads to ... ... ... ... ... .. 4 . just copy mp3 's avi 's on there like a removable usb drive . 5 . a/v out to tv is cool . 6 . a/v in to record video is a nice extra . so far it 's played every avi i 've thrown at it . i 've got 15gb of music on there and just let it random play the whole lot i use the a2 mostly when driving . i got a nice fm transmitter that powers off the cig socket , sound quality is pretty good . only problem i have is that i have to carry the a2 in the house at night for fear of it getting stolen out of the car ! i also invested in the silicon cover from zcover-it comes with a plastic screen protector and is perfect for when my 2 yr old wants to watch one of his movies on there ( the a2 makes for a great pacifier ! ) mine came with the latest firmware on there so there was no need to upgrade . i 'm very happy with the a2 and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for am honest to goodness media player and has no need for subscription services or any other force fed crap .
1	i 've owned 2 sets of these types of phone systems . a ge set and a 2.4 gig uniden set . this is by far the best . actually , it 's perfect . no noise on the line at all . everything just works perfectly . only one caution . this particular model does not have an answering machine . i was moving too fast when i bought and thought that it did . if you want an answering machine to come with , make sure you buy the right model . i 'm totally sold on the dect 6.0 ! ! ! ! buy it . you wo n't regret it .
1	the product shipped immediately , a new dell ac adapter from cable4less . i am extremely happy with the company and the charger 's performance as i needed a second one so i would not have to keep plugging in and out my primary charger . i did n't think i could get such a good deal on a real dell product
1	this photo paper is truly top of the line , profession grade paper . i have been using it for a few years in making very large photo prints - and they always turn out great .
1	i have been enjoying these speakers outside by my pool for several months now , and the quality of the sound is excellent , particularly given the reasonable price . i 'm sure you can get better performance , but it will cost much more . these speakers are a rare find in today 's business world -- something that is actually a good deal ...
0	i have had this printer for more than a year . at first , it was a great printer . not anymore ! ! it uses up ink like no other , yes , it is great to have the individual tanks ( which is why i bought the thing ) but now the print head is n't working right . do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up , and the problem is still there . the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed . went to the canon website , they do n't even acknowledge this printer ever existed . my recommendation is do n't buy this model ! !
0	item is advertised as working with all rino series but it does not work with the rino 53
1	this is great . it makes it easier for us all to listen to the music in the car
0	i bought this drive in late 2003 , and it 's gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then . the positives first - though it has an 8mb buffer it is very fast , and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers . it does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older 40gig and 20gig wd 's , and the newer seagates . 2.5 years after purchase , the drive started corrupting files like crazy . wd has tools on their site to check your disk status , and sure enough it was due for an rma . when i checked the warranty status online , 6 months had mysteriously 'vanished ' from my warranty period . the drive warranty had started 6 months before i 'd purchased it ! anyway , it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick . still , this is my second wd drive to die , and i 'm going with other brands from now .
1	it does everything promised but takes several hours of going over the instructions to figure out how to program some of the features . instructions hard to locate in booklet
0	the machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cd's/dvd 's . i ca n't give a complete review of the product because i only tried to repair 1 dvd ... and it did not repair it
1	i have multiple cameras , and one of my favorite features is that this reader can support multiple types of cards plugged in at one time . if you have a sd card and a cf card , both can be inserted and read/written to without having to switch out the cards . very nice reader for a great price . the blue led is very pleasant to look at .
0	this cable looks nice , when you do n't linger on a digital channel . what happens to me is that if i leave the tv on a digital channel overnight , the next day it will be a split screen mode , showing double image of the broadcast . to fix it , i have to change it to a non-digital channel and switch it back . i guess it is possible that it is the cable box , but nothing happens like that on the component outputs
1	this is a great little machine and has so many uses . i bought 2 of them and 2 days later came back to amazon to buy some more for gifts and the price has doubled ... what 's with that ? keep looking and you 'll find this at a hot price again eventually
0	i also had the model before the m85v and got great reception . this new model gets terrible reception . i still have my old model and put the old one next to the new one and it was like night and day with the reception . do n't waste your money on this model !
0	this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix s6 camera ( but the fuji and sandisk product did
1	to my eyes , the printer 's rendition of colors is above average . it is n't horrible but neither is it the best . pricewise it 's an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature . we 've been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via tray 2 ( the default paper supply ) and have n't any problems . the manual ( electronic file ) advises `` never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels . '' so it 's a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label . a wonderful quality of experience is the near `` instant on '' ( very minimal warmup ) feature and it 's quiet . my previous okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing . its time delay was also a disadvantage . i think most people will be very happy with the hp . [ ...
0	it seems nice enough and it 's cheap , but it is apparently incompatible with the canon powershot digital elphs . for use with those cameras , buy sandisck instead . seriously
1	we love this tuner , and the kids have had fun finding out what key different sounds make . they change their voice , tap on things with pencils , etc .
1	i have two seperate units . one hardwired to my car , and the other is the jvc unit . i hooked it directly into the audio ( aux ) ports of my radio , rather than use an fm station . it works great , the sound quality is excellent as well - ( and my radio is so old it play 's 8-tracks ! ! ! ! ) . i did notice that the unit tends to run a bit warm to hot . i agree with the previous reviews , that it is something that jvc needs to look into , perhaps it is simply a matter of a `` heat sink-er '' not being in specs , as yet , i have encountered no problems ( having had the jvc unit for 1.5 years ) no matter . as to the commercial free : sirius ( which i have had a subscription to for the past 4 years ) has commercial free radio , though the news stations and a few others do have commercials . those stations are clearly defined as being in the commercial block . the music stations are 100 % free of commercial . all in all a damn cheap price to pay for avoidance of all those really irritating dj 's , commerical 's , and lack of variety in stations ! ~cheers !
1	as the ps2 does not have hdmi outputs for high-definition tv 's , the monster cable gamelink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more . you 'd have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard ( red , white , yellow ) av cables picture clarity . they are in two different worlds and monster fully delivers . however , your tv must have component ( red , blue , green ) inputs for this cable to be useful . ensure that you have a fiber optic digital cable for your sound to go from your ps2 to your compatible tv/receiver . these cables are for picture only and do not have a sound cable . therefore , you 'll have to forget using the single plug-in the ps2 offers for both audio and video . however , your sound will be uncompressed , fully digital audio . this is definitely a plus , rather than a negative . any mid-priced television or receiver built in the last six years will have a digital audio input
1	do n't let the size fool you - i do n't know much about audio - yet - but i can tell you the sound recorded from this mic is wayyyy better than the usb microphone headset i was using . much crisper with out all the fuzziness . and i did n't spend nearly as much as the online gurus were recommending . i am sure the $ 600 mic is great - but this is doing every thing i need .
0	i 'm using this in an area where , as usual , there is no map data for the trails and roads . navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain , to known trails i 've been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when i should have my chin up navigating . even then , the functionality is very limited . seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool , but so far it 's only a novelty item . in order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded i will need to purchase the $ 100 mapsend software which contains no useful data for me , only provides the functionality of editing/creating my own base map . a function i can only do on my laptop , something i usually do n't carry out into the wilderness . basically i bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges , passes , peaks and unknown road systems , while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress . so far it 's a 0/5 points in this department . if you want to find your way back to points this is useful , however for other types of navigation involving linear objects , such as trails and roads , waterways the software is n't there yet
1	i bought this for my wife . i have an iriver hp120 , which i consider to be one of the best ever made . i have to say , i think this is a great little player . the interface is well designed , the unit is well made , and the sound quality is excellent . i purchased a u2 about 1 year ago as a gift , which was also excellent . i think cowon is making some of the better mp3 players on the market now , and i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality unit
0	i ' writing this eview onthe nwkeoard tht i picked up a few urs don stop redingdue to th numerous misspellins and rors . that 's the kyboard , nome ! ! i'mt ba to to y na o y n acino esr i ia . ok , switching over to a wired keyboard ! ! the above mess was me trying to type on the microsoft 6000 v2 keyboard ! ! i 'm taking it back to the store asap ! ! according to the programs , i have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing , but you see what comes out ! not once have i had a low signal warning or anything . i just get random intermittent letters to appear . now , perhaps it 's because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray , but my goodness ! this thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet . i measured and they 're about a foot and a half apart ! ! i type for hours on end per day and have been typing `` properly '' for about 16 years . i type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals ! ! another thing i noticed about the 6000 ( and actually was concerned with it while i was trying it out in the store ) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped . perhaps it 's due to the curve of the keyboard and i 'm just not used to it yet ( although i have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them . the 4000 felt fine ( even though it has a somewhat awkward layout ! ! ) no matter what , that thing is going back ! i 'm far too agitated to keep it ! oh , there are some neato plusses ! i love the shortcut keys . it 's nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e-mail , my music , my pictures , or whatever else i assign the keys to . i had gotten excited about that feature , and will be sad to lose it ( even though i only had it for about an hour . ) better luck to the rest of you
0	i tried it on 4 laptops , and none of them was able to sustain the signal . it kept on dropping out ! mind you , two of the internal cards did a much better job than it .
1	i could n't believe how great this cd case is ! i had a ton of loose cd 's all over the place because i did n't have any cases . with this i could hold them all with a ton of room to spare !
1	i purchased this so my pc could share a monitor with my xbox360 . does the job at a cheap cost ! so easy to use that my 4 yr. old can use it
1	i , ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you `` must '' plug in . hey guys , try it without an outside energy source , i just hope i , m not gon na fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port . i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare , but no more pci slots , damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards , why do 2 of em have to take up so much room . oh well , trade offs are a bi -- - , but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice
1	i purchased the 2gb elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp sp2 with and without the most recent simpletech drivers . i do n't have another card reader for my computer , but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it 's the card reader . shortly afterwards , i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2.0 sd/mmc reader for a bit less in price than the card alone . i also noticed the atp line of 60x and 150x sd cards . i have no experience with their products , but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell . they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof . i 'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me , but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors , i will consider the atp cards in the future .
0	i will never buy a brand new product release from linksys again . their q.c . stinks . i am on the third wrt54gx4 router and it is the first that was not defective . i got it set up and tried my new wpc54gx4 network card ( srx400 ) and got a weak signal , but i had my second laptop with a wpc54gx card ( srx200 ) on the desk getting 100 % signal strength . i switched cards in the two computers , and the old srx200 card was better in either computer ( both xp pro ) . after hours with semi-english speaking techs , they came to the same conclusion i came to in five minutes ... a bad antenna in the new wpc54gx4 . so once again amazon will replace a defective linksys product for me . i had been a linksys fan in the past , but not any more . here 's a link to a picture of the first router i got and its defect . http : //vowe.net/archives/006639.htm
0	tried this with two different computers using windows vista . got this message : `` one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned , and windows does not recognize it . '' the mini-disk that came with it was no help . no response from tiger direct . went to radio shack and got one . it works
0	in the ten minutes since i 've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off . more importantly , it ca n't handle large manuals as advertised . ( the reason i purchased this particular book holder ) my 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter . based on that i estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages . if you do n't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on , keep an eye on the page retainers ( these are the parts that fell off ) and you should be ok. as for me , i 'm off to read amazon 's return policy and see if i can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic
0	this carrying case worked well for me until i jumped in my car and the case caught on the door frame and the belt clip ripped right off of it , causing my ipod to fall to the pavement . it turns out the clip is n't fastened on all that securely
1	without a doubt this is the best product of its type , i looked at several others priced significantly higher , and after setting up the am2 it was clear i had made the best choice
1	so this controller looked pretty sweet to me so i bought it over a rumble pad . i liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat , as i tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers . i bought this controller specifically for star wars battlefront 2 on pc , and it works like a dream . i also like the x-box controller layout ( offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic ) than the ps2 style controller that is the logitech rumble pad . it also has better grips than a ps2 controller . the only things i think are bad about it are the following : 1 . it is not modeled on the large xbox controller , but rather the regular one , which is ok for most people , but i have big hands and i get a bit cramped up if i play for way too long . 2 . i was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad . i have a saitek cyborg evo joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game . this is n't an issue with battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator , but i could see where if a game did n't have as good an interface ( or maybe older games ) this pad could suffer in this regard . 3 . this is n't so much an issue for me , but i would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan , that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out . i do n't care too much , because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything . i will still use it even if it does die . overall , a great controller , i actually would give it a 4.5 rating , but that is n't an option here
1	when you look at the price , it may seem pricey but when you get the product , there is some serious engineering involved . the web reviews have all been favorable and this is the reason i bought an ergotron . the attention to detail is incredible . mounting the middle monitor is definitely a two-person job . other than that the installation was flawless . this is a very solid and well machined . kudos to ergotron . ( also these guys are serious about ergonomics -- 10 pages on how to set proper height for various installations . ) wonderful product - 5 stars . shipping from amazon was slow and behind schedule .

0	the shape conforms perfectly to the designer 's hands , but unless you share the same dna , i 'd avoid this product . i 've used many of these over the years and this is the only one i struggled with . constantly shifting it to get it 's high and low points in a place that was tolerable . i finally reversed it , pointing it towards me and it worked a little better . this just needs to be a simple pad . instead , they 've overdesigned it as a gimmick .

0	i would like to believe that this hub works well- but i would n't know . i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac . i hooked up my printer , ipod and digital camera and nothing happened . i called targus and they said i needed an a/c adaptor . it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions , or their website . they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info ( 5 volt , 2.1 amp , center positive ) . i 've been to two radio shacks and online- they do n't carry it . i 'm upset . any advice
0	i did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the serial port on a computer . since most new computers use usb for serial interface , the usefulness of this unit is limited . my two newly purchased hp computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product . i would not have bought it had i known this . i have not used the gps since i bought it . it will probably be tossed out . the serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package . so you do n't see it prior to opening the package . once the package is opened it is a mess that probably can not be returned . lastly , this is one of the worst packaging jobs i have seen . the plastic clamshell is so hard to open that i think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors . the cut plastic is also dangerous
0	a terrific idea : show the current time and the alarm times all at once . very intuitive , very helpful . unfortunately , the backlit lcd display just does n't make the grade . the numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable . the manufacturer 's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear , but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic . the numbers just wash out . it 's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer 's image and from the unit i got . i think that would be a slight improvement , because on the one i got , the orange ( backlighting the alarm times ) is about twice as bright as the green ( backlighting the current time ) , and it just looks weird . also , fm radio reception is quite poor . the line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna , but that just does n't work well no matter how i orient the cord . i ca n't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away . so back it goes
0	i am very happy with my meridian color and the other mapsend products i have purchased , however , at first i couldnt get this product to work . i had no problem getting this software to run with xp ( even without the patch ) , however i couldnt view the basemap i had loaded onto my magellan . i tried to address this with the company . it has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails . customer service for this product is nonexistant . i joined the yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer . turns out i just had to go to the menu -- card utilities and maunually select the basemap . i did not know that basemaps dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do . i cannt say enough great things about my experience with my magellan meridian color though . navigating through hungary like a pro , i didnt miss a single turn . i would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it . the magellan meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does , portability it provides and is 100 percent upgradable with new software and new maps . get you head out of your a__ thales . you have some great products , but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support . i recommend anyone with a question about softward or the gps join the yahoo groups and post the question there . dont waste your time with customer support .
0	i have an ipaq pda and i own a tomtom gps -- both of which work well . this combo ipaq/tomtom is 'in the rough ' and needs to undergo some re-tooling . i 'm surprised that other reviewers mention what i deem significant flaws and then go on to rate the unit as a 4 or 5 star . for example , the travel companion stalls and needs soft-resets . for a right handed person , the stylus is awkward . support is not good . moving through programs can be painfully slow . the gps tracking lags . i depend on my gps and pda for business travel . buy the rx5915 if you like to play with gadgets as it 's loaded with some fun stuff . but , not if you need something dependable while on the road .
0	not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again . it worked right most of the time , but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button . i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to `` reset '' and work correctly . it 's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working . bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for . fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand
1	i saw the small size of this case and was in love . it has plenty of space for dvds and cords ( though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold ) . it is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky . it 's great . you wont regret it .

1	my 2 year old saw this in bjs and kept asking for it , so santa brought it for him for christmas . i think it 's a good first guitar . he loves to strum it , but he definitely needs to be supervised to teach him to respect that it is a special musical instrument , not a toy . so far he has sat on it and used it as a drum and it 's held up fine , but i do n't think it would hold up with such continued abuse . it is recommended for children much older than he is , so i ca n't expect anything different . i do wish they made a smaller version of it so it would be more comfortable for him . for a better price than i see at amazon , you can get a small hohner guitar at a music store , which might be better quality , i 'm not sure . regardless , i am very happy with this guitar and i would recommend it for any child who shows a real interest in music . i would not buy it for a child just as a toy , unless you do n't mind it being destroyed . i am planning to buy the guitar strap and will review that when i get it
0	my job requires a kvm switch for qa purposes to test different os/browser combinations . in building the lab i decided to go with belkin after researching various switches . i 'm configuring a lab with a mac g4 , mac mini , nc6000 laptop and hp dc5100 mini tower . i 'm using the hp supplied keyboard and mouse , and a viewsonic 19 lcd flatscreen . the first kvm worked well for right at 30 days . at that point the mouse began to act erratic , followed shortly by the switch only working in the # 1 slot ( laptop ) . i ordered a second switch and the same thing happened within 30 days again . i 'm going to return the switch and try the well rated iogear miniview 4 port usb kvw .
1	after all the hype on-line about the t-amp , i had to check it out for myself . all the reports are true ! this is one hot little audio amp which can not be touched for the price . if you have a portable audio device and two speakers you need to drive with it - this amp is for you . you will not be disappointed . i recommend purchasing the ac power supply as well . you can find others cheaper , but the recommended one works perfectly and insures the warrantee for the t-amp remains valid
0	first of all , the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself . i did get it quickly ( 2 or 3 days ) , but i had several problems with it : ( 1 ) i repeatedly tried it on my dvd player and the player hung . each time i had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond . i tried over 10 times and got the same result each time . ( 2 ) i tried it on dvd drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well . had to ctrl-alt-del to get my dvd player software to close . on the 3rd attempt it actually did work . ( 3 ) i repeatedly tried it on dvd drive 2 on my computer . each time i got a message saying `` no disk '' . i consider it item a waste of money
0	simply put , the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely . there are always bubbles . if you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you . the keyboard soft material cover is not so bad , but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard . so , when you close the lid , the material then transfers some of that dirt right back . my resolve ... just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft , clean , semi-wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster
1	i got this card last month and i 've been using it heavily . its been great . its sturdy and can has great range . there are a few problems though . # 1 there is no case for the card . # 2 the included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible . luckily i had netfront 3.1 # 3 memory stick lan software will occasionally error , but a soft reset will fix it . otherwise its a great little expansion card
1	installation time was only about 20 min . hook up the digital and analog cables , and it configures itself . it took me a while to decide which resolution to use that was best for me , but once i found it , i was really pleased with the size and clarity . music composition is much easier with the big screen . one small con was the stand is not adjustable , but it fit perfectly into my office space , so i did n't need the adjustment . the video quality on this lcd is amazing . ronnie be

0	amazon was great about shipping this product , but i eventually returned it due to several problems . they were also great about the return -- they paid the return shipping and i got a full refund . i never tried any recordings with this card using the media center software that is part of windows mce . i was using it with snapstream beyondtv 4.1 . if you record using anything but the best ( dvd 720x480 ) quality level it would crop out part of the picture . this is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue . the latest hauppauge driver did not solve the problem . the other problem i had is that several times when i was recording two programs at the same time , one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it . i do n't know if this was a problem with the card or beyondtv , but i think it 's probably due to the card . i do n't know if i had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards . i also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured . i have hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other pcs , and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card . after reading some reviews , it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also ( and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card ) . beyondtv works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above ; but i also only have one tuner card in the pcs that i use these cards in , so i ca n't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using beyondtv . i returned the 500 card , and i instead purchased two visiontek xtasy theater 550 pro cards . thus far i 'm not having any of the issues with them in beyondtv that i was having with the hauppauge 500 card -- i can record at a lower quality level with no cropping , and i 've had no audio issues so far . the quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card ( although maybe not as good as that captured by the hauppauge 250 and 350 cards ) .
1	i have been using a lot mouses during last years , but this is the best far away from the others . it 's very comfortable to use it ... ..
0	i am very unhappy with the product i received from tiger . it was not what i wanted and to return it would cost me more than i paid for it . the company charges tooooo many fees . i am very unhappy now i have a product that i ca n't use or return
0	good thing first , efficient on battery , convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge . thats it . as most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low iq software people working in sony . utterly non user friendly . i develop software for a living and i am not afraid to use new software ... even though i was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy.. i had 1gb of atrac songs on this player from my computer . then one day my computer hdd crashed . i was kind of thankful that i had saved atleast 1 gb of music on this bean walkman . atleast all the hours i spent in transfering did not go waste . as soon as i fixed the new hdd and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back ... i tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me ( a very indifferent group of people ) . it is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money . of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and i dont want to go abt that.. it is absolutely infuriating
1	it 's a great tool to have at all times . security , provacy , and power in one little handy device . and the u3 apps are multiplying quickly . next i want a full-blown system on a flash drive
1	i purchase this on amazon for $ 499 no tax free shipping . you can not match this quality at this price . the hd with hdmi cable using comcast digital box is outstanding . the sound is also better with the hdmi vs componet cables . the jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode . the picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color . i looked at samsung for $ 800 and i am glad i saved myself $ 300 with this lcd
0	does not work on vista . sooooo disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with vista upgrade ( save for the windows startup music ) . i thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back . might have , but it says not compatible with vista . i guess i 'll be getting a new computer . :
1	i first saw these speakers at the apple store , and i really liked the sound and the look . i went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them . as long as you have a decent soundcard , these speakers really are great . i have had no problem with them at all , they look really cool , they 're loud , they 're small , the woofer gives you a lot of bass ( which you can turn down ) , and the sound from the speakers is clear . buy these
1	its a great graphics card , especially for the price . i got it to improve roller coaster tycoon 3 and it did . but the controls arent as clear as they could be for the anti-aliasing settings and the anisotropic filtering
0	if you can make it work or if you are lucky to get a non defective unit : it can only read 1 card at a time needs specific usb power requirements ( needs the usb power be +5v and not +5vsb ) else you will get `` usb hub power exceeded errors '' the worst part is that the mainboard i tested is +5v ... and still did n't work the cards inserted on the lower card slots have to be inserted upside down from time to time you can get the message usb device not recognized ... contacted support ... service there = average/not so good ( support forum has several topics complaining about this product ) could n't get a replacement since 30 days tigerdirect warranty have expired , ca n't send the unit to ultra because currently i 'm outside the us and as i stated customer service is not good . bottom line do n't buy this item
0	i purchased this item per other recommendations and that of stereophile magazine , thinking that this would be useful for broadcasting itunes and internet radio programming to other parts of my home . first , reception was terrible even with the reciever placed only a few feet away from the transmitter . second , i tried the tweak ( turning up the volume pot ) suggested in other ratings . this did n't help matters from a reception standpoint , in addition , the unit is so poorly constructed that the mere act of opening it dislodges the volume potentiometer . third , the volume pot itself is of very poor construction . in short , it does n't work , you wo n't be happy -- even if you attempt to `` fix '' it yourself -- do n't buy this product
1	contrary to popular belief , i even had a good experience the one time i needed technical support . a few random disconnects , but overall a great product
1	i bought this deck about 6 months ago . it has performed flawless in every aspect . as soon as i turned it on i could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck . i have taken all of my cd 's out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface . the ipod function is flawless and easy to use . just plug in your ipod and search by artist , album , song title or playlist . this can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so i would suggest using playlists . the output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing . also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs , this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment . this deck is the best overall i have ever listened to
0	i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it . i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try . i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me , but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i could n't listen anymore with it . it is now in a landfill somewhere . my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable . for now just have the radio and cds i burn
1	i have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on . op/tech came up with the solution ! all you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go . super easy to take off , putting on takes a little more time , but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway . basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt , water , etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots . it is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used
0	while i 'm driving , this thing does n't work at all . there 's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time . the only time this fm transmitter works is when my car is still . maybe it 's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter ca n't reach it . overall , i 'd say this product is garbage
0	overall i do n't like it . when the screen is black between scenes and what not , their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference . buy a different one , this one is just not up to the task
0	bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera . it worked for 2 days.after that , everytime i on the camera , it wanted me to reformat the card , wth is that ? now i ca n't use it at all ... . i 'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from amazon.one mistake i made , i threw away the shipping and product packages once i tested out the card , thought it worked and it would be ok.i can no longer return it now . needless to say , i 'm too over confident with lexar 's products . buyers beware ...
0	the material and ergonomics of this phone is average . the selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line . below are the factors that i considered before purchasing and my experience : range : the range of the phone is very good . i can be 80-100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop . call quality : average . i have a plantronics cs50 wireless headset that is on the 900 mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit . the call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear . when i have switched during mid-conversation from the handset to headset , or vice-versa , callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call . the uniden is much more muffled and less clear . it is however comparable to most cordless phone . not exceptional , but not bad . durability : average . i have dropped my handsets on rare occasions , they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well . one of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor , which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it did n't scratch the hardwood floor . special note : i suffered a power outage during a major windstorm . the base unit will not boot up . this appears to have happened to other reviewers . this problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house . on this issue , i have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars
0	as with some of the other reviewers , mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter . i bought a vector brand inverter at wal-mart and it is much better
1	i bought it for my canon s3 is . first i tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems . then i did the suggested format by canon and it worked the same : perfect . fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera ; have n't any problem of corruption . i 've been tempted to buy another one .
1	i use my lx4 2.1 system as my desktop pc speakers . i got this recommendation from maximum pc , since the lx4 5.1 system was 2005 's best speaker system . you can view their gear of the year review here : http : //www.maximumpc.com/2005/12/m-audio_studiop_1.html . being skeptical of a $ 550 5.1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite , i wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2.1 system . as soon as i purchased cables ( fyi : no 1/8 '' stereo to two 1/4 '' mono cables seem to exists -as far as i 've seen -- , so you have to use adaptors ) i was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the speakers . i was n't used to speakers with crossovers , where only the each type of speaker ( tweeter , woofer , and sub ) gets the right frequencies , so no overlapping exists . all the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient , while the speakers themselves are of superb build quality . after only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound-intensive games , i immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5.1 expander setup . if you are looking for speakers that play really loud , or can fill a living room with the desired feel for an action movie , these are not for you . but if you want incredibly accurate pc speakers or relatively cheap studio monitors this is definitely the setup for you . you will not be disappointed if you buy the lx4 for your bedroom or for computer use
0	after owning a p-touch labeler for years , i found the need for a more duable label than my `` m '' tape was providing . i opted for this `` tz '' tape labeler . good price , looks good . what a mistake ! ! ! the only thing well designed about this unit is it 's abilty to waste more tape than it uses ! ! if you print a label of any size , count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it ! ! ! at $ 20.00 a roll , prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.then go find the scissors and cut the excess off , so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk ! ! ! but cheer up you can push six buttons , every time , to reduce the margin to `` narrow '' . this will reduce the waste to a half inch on one side of the label , and print two small dots on the other side , this will show you where to cut it with your scissors , to match the `` narrow '' side . also you must do all settings for every label every time ! ! another `` great feature , it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size , so you will only print large print.what a joke ! ! ! what a hassle ! ! now the good news . i used to make lots of labels , and now i only make labels for very important items . and only when i am up to getting mad for doing so . i really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars ! you have been warned
1	i bought this enclosure about 1 year ago . i put a 200gb hard drive in it and use it as my dedicated itunes library . it was a super easy setup . many complain in the other reviews that it 's a tight fit inside , but i did n't find it difficult at all to get the hard drive in . after connecting the hard drive and closing it up , i simply connected it via firewire to my mac g4 and it worked like a charm ! next month i will have it for 1 year and i would be 100 % happy with it if not for one thing ... the loud fan noise after about 10 minutes of it being turned on ! arghh ! ! all of a sudden it just starts sounding off with this annoying buzzing sound that gets slightly louder with time . every-so-often , the buzzing goes away for about 1 to 2 minutes , but it always returns with a vengence ! otherwise , the enclosure has held up and worked nicely for almost 1 year . i 'm definitly going to get rid of it though once i find an enclosure that is equally aesthetically pleasing and as reliable , but not nearly as noisy ! ! ! it 's a shame actually , since i 'm in the market to get 2 more enclosures to house my aperture library and data backup , respectively
0	this unit satisfies in its gps functionality , but is problematic elsewhere . when i decided to purchase a gps , i decided to spend the extra money and get a integrated handsfree bluetooth unit for my phone ( motorola razr v3 ) . the bluetooth connection was easy to set up and reliably would find my phone and connect . unfortunately , the bluetooth connection would disconnect after about five minutes , even though the 6000t would still show the unit and phone as connected . customer service was no help ... . it seems their script only includes the instructions `` download the latest software '' ( i already had ) and `` reset the unit '' ( did n't help ) . second problem : the unit started turning itself off randomly ( actually , it went into `` sleep mode '' ) while driving down the road . the customer service response ? you are correct ... . `` download the latest software '' ( i already had ) and `` reset the unit '' ( did n't help ) . i finally complained loudly enough that they told me to send the unit in for repair ( at my expense , of course ) . i received it back and the bluetooth feature was not repaired . their solution for the unit randomly going into sleep mode ? they turned off the power management so the unit would not go into sleep mode under any circumstance . well , i suppose that is a solution , but a pretty crappy one since , if you forget to power down the unit manually when you leave the vehicle , the gps battery will be totally drained when you get back in the car . i expected much better at this price point . shoulda gone with garmin
0	the is perhaps the lease durable item i have purchased in 40 years . it lights up just fine , and it is a reassuring led gold , but it refuses to do anything with my xd card . it worked just fine for 3-4 days , then erased about 100 photos , all of them irreplaceable . cheap yes , but cheap junk .
1	while the two fans i ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly , they are not as advertised on amazon 's website . according to the specs on the site , they have a double ball-bearing design which last longer than normal fans . be warned , these are not the antec double ball-bearing fans , but the less expensive ones . have contacted amazon and hope they update the specs to reflect these accurately
1	i have went through so many cd-r blanks and finally found some with some good dye and have zero error burning rate . tdk is amazing . the first one i 've burned i 've now had for over a year and still no defects on the back of it . it 's amazing
0	product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web . in addition , no `` all region code '' supportted ! i will return it asap .
0	this device worked great for a short span of time ( a few weeks ) , then just stopped working . i returned it to amazon and received a new replacement . it worked fine for a while , then stopped working . it 's a great idea , but very weak quality
0	i do not think suction cup mounts work very well . this one is no exception . while attaching and detaching my garmin nuvii is easy enough , the cup does not support the weight . i was disappointed that a friction bag was not available for my nuvii . however , i was able to jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise . i ordered the friction mount , removed the screws on the bottom , detaching the mounts that would not fit my nuvii , and stapled velcro strips purchased at walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount . i have been cross country using this system and it works . the garmin portable friction mount for gps 010-10306-00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself
0	my friend has this cord to connect his ipod to his stereo , and it works great , great sound , good ease of use etc . i wanted one so i went to bestbuy today and got one by rca that sounds just as good for $ 7.99
1	one warning for users with over head lights . the 6000 keyboard that has tranparent ( light gray ) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right . i have a light directly above my desk and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear . go for a black key or similar model
1	i like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs , just set back and relax ... .your covered .
1	i have been using memorex dvd-r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player/recorder . not all of my recordings were successful , no product i know is 100 % perfect , but the majority have been successful with memorex dvd blank media . this 50-pack spindle was purchased from amazon because i know i can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping . moreover , i have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from amazon . after trying many dvd-r blank media , i found memorex dvd-r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance .
0	i wish i had read the amazon reviews of this item before i paid $ 19 for it at an office supply store . it may seem a bit trivial , but the smell of this wrist pad was a deal breaker . it 's unfortunate , too , because everything else about it is perfect : the color , the comfortable gel support and soft fabric , and the size ( it runs the length of my mac keyboard and provides support when i use my mouse ) . but the smell : a piercing , toxic smell that does not go away . it does n't matter if i spend five minutes or five hours in front of my computer , i still smell the synthetic backing of the wrist pad , and it 's made it impossible for me to work . i finally had to get rid of it
1	the six commonly used power tips provide flexibility with this product . i purchased this to use as an interface between a cd walkman player and the ac power cord . the heads have specific polarity ; so it is possible to attach the heads incorrectly . however , if you pay attention to the plus and minus hookups as indicated , it 's not too difficult to make the attachment correctly the first time . i found the product to work effectively . the only negative i can see is that the actual plug-in device is a bit bulky ; so if you want to use this in a power strip setting , the ah3wh can be a bit of a plug hog . however , other than that limitation , the product was reliable . recommended to save on those batteries which do add up
0	this was my first , and only , purchase of a linksys product . i unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer , then hooked it up to another printer , only to have it die just out of warranty . a completely worthless piece of chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer does n't even stand behind it
0	out of the past 20 burns , i have only had 10 dvd 's burn successfully . i use roxio cd creator version 7 , which does a great job with my cd 's , so i 'm pretty sure it 's the dvd media . not only am i wasting all my money , but my time as well . i 've tried to lower the burn speed , but it does not matter . i 'd try something else
1	great features with the microsoft mouse . wanted at least a 4 button mouse so internet travel is much easier . comes with a usb dongle that i did not want to use so i was determined to get this mouse working with the built-in bluetooth in my new dell latitude notebook . found that the toshiba drivers provided by dell for the bluetooth would not work with the microsoft mouse . seems still some incompatibility with different manufactures of bluetooth devices . go figure ... . had to delete the toshiba drivers and let xp with sp-2 provide the drivers and it works great . pros : great features , no cord , long battery life between charges ( days ) , very responsive . cons : some difficulty getting it to work without supplied dongle , bigger than i like to pack around for a notebook .
1	in general , lexar 's usb drive does its job just as well as other usb drives ; there is n't much of a difference except for the following : 1 ) portability good : it has a convenient way of attaching to your keychain bad : this rubber holder only lasts for so long ( in my case 6-8 months ) 2 ) it is extremely durable . this drive survived a full 30 minute ( clothes ) washer cycle . when i took it out of the washer , i thought all the data and the drive was gone for good . to my surprise ( after letting it dry for a day ) it worked just fine . this is amazing ! i have also accidentally stepped on it while wearing shoes ( not using all of my weight though ) a few times on carpet and concrete ; and still works fine . finally , i have dropped this drive on a variety of surfaces and it 's still fine . 3 ) looks : good : it is very easy to see since it is bright red bad : it is fatter than other usb drives and it is bright red . the drive is pretty ugly . it maybe good to note however , that the drive 's structure is probably a good reason as to why it has survived my abuse . the bright red color 's advantage has already been mentioned above
0	i bought one for my son at christmas and it broke after a month . it just suddenly would n't turn on . amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days , before even getting the original back . but the replacement model `` froze up '' after just 4 days and this time i am getting a refund . to quote an e-mail from amazon regarding this product `` as it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought , we are not able to send another replacement . '' so , do not order one !
0	the case was advertised in a size large enough to accomodate my camera but when i received it the size was very small . now i am stuck with something i can not use . your return policy was that it had to be in original packaging and unopened . how is one to know unless they open it
1	i ca n't remember when i felt so good about an online purchase . the product is more than i expected for the money and the quick service just awed me ! i will definately be doing business through amazon many , many more times in the future ! thank you
1	i have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything i hoped for . when i first opened the box it was shipped in i was very put off . there was a very , very strong chemical smell . i chalked it up to something in the packaging material . it turns out that was not where the smell was coming from . it was the mouse pad itself . having worked in a shoe factory years ago i was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue . the smell hung around for a couple of days . now , 1 week after having received my purchase if i put my nose close to the pad , it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue . i would caution those with allergies and/or asthma to consider this prior to purchase . as an asthmatic i can say it did affect my breathing some what . that seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened . i have finished with my public health warning . on to the mouse pad . it is simply the best mouse pad i have ever used . i have had wrist problems for over 4 years now . i have had swelling and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work . in the past week my swelling has greatly reduced . my pain is almost gone . my wrist sits perfectly on the wrist rest . the pad actually cradles my wrist . the wrist rest moves with my hand , so well and with so much support , it seems to be an extension of my body . a new improved appendage . i have found myself resting my wrist on the pad even while not computing but just sitting at my desk . it truly is that comfortable . i already have plans to purchase two more for friends as christmas gifts . worth every cent ! go for it ! you will not be disappointed !
1	after looking around at the local stores ( fry 's and compusa ) i had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my ipod in multiple environments - on my belt and also in exercise , and had resigned myself to having a `` skin '' type case for just everyday use and then shifting the ipod to an arm band for exercise . not a particularly great solution - expensive ( around $ 20 for each ) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses . then i ran into the dlo action jacket at best buy , which seemed to cover all my intended uses . unlike the prior reviewer , i found my 40g ipod fits very snugly - absolutely zero slop , and i really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case . also , at $ 29.95 , it 's cheaper than the two-case approach . the only criticism i have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case . the process is a little tedious , but the end result is great . the unit feels very secure on my arm and it 's easy to forget that it 's there . this jacket is a winner
1	this is a nice product , i buught it beacause i needed to play dvds from foreign country and my fancy `` sony '' dvd vcr player ca n't read them but this little thing can , it reads all the standards i 'm glad i 've got it .
0	the card worked fine for my son 's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother 's wedding and i lost all the photos from that event . i still ca n't believe it happened . if you have an ipod , or other , remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this
1	this is a very good sounding sub for the price . i compared others at higher prices and liked how this produced a full range to compliment the other speakers . it fills a 1500 sq ft room with cathedral ceiling very well . i would buy another
0	i bought this samsung model in september because of the superior picture and excellent glare reduction . it went black the day before the super bowl . it is now ncaa playoffs and it has not been repaired or replaced . the service technician has tried 3 times to repair , now having replaced every component . i am finally on a replacement list with no eta . the samsung customer service reps have been unhelpful and unconcerned . the repair technician is the only person who has apologised and tried to push samsung - with no success
0	after receiving this drum which was listed as having a 25,000 yield capacity , on 12/11/06 ... .today 1/15/07 my printer is giving me the same error message `` drum near end '' there was no indication when i purchased this product that it would be refurbished..i certainly have not printed 25,000 copies ...
0	i ordered this antenna to enhance the reception of the uhf channels . i live in a big city and i thought i should n't have a problem with any indoor antenna . it seems i was mistaken . this antenna is useless . it is almost no better than my previous 99 cents store antenna
0	why do i get the feeling that some of these later reviews were written by kensington people ? the fact is , this light has some unique features that most usb lights do n't , including an on/off switch and two brightness levels . however , that does n't come close to overcoming the drawbacks . first of all , the price is way too high for what you are getting . also , the brightness difference between four and eight leds is negligible . but the biggest flaw in this light , by far , is that the flexible arm is not nearly strong enough to support the weight of the lamp . i have had to resort to clamping the arm to the side of my monitor , which is just plain ridiculous . for the price they are getting , they should have produced a more durable product
1	i do n't know where the guy below got that this card does n't work with windows media center edition because i just installed the latest xp drivers for the card on media center edition 2005 and it works perfectly . i sold my gigaport ag to get this because of the much better signal/noise ratio that the firewire audiophile has and it made a big difference . very clean sound ! i use it to dj with using mixvibes , using the asio drivers and it works beautifully ! a great buy to say the least ... pick one up , you wont regret it
0	does not consistently work ! i have a toshiba a15 ( win xp pro ) and sometimes this works , but usually it does n't . lately , it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer . it used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found , which forced me to reload the driver . but lately it 's just been giving me a blue screen . i have used pcmcia cards before and never once had any issues . d-link needs to support their faulty product with a new driver ! bad customer service ! i will never buy a d-link product again ! !
1	i got this product when i first signed up to telewest broadband and it has never failed . i have had it for 2 years and not a problem . i started at 512kbps and they 've upgraded me to 4mbps and it handles that speed without a problem . perfect for your light , moderate or heavy user , good all-rounder . thanks for reading :
1	this is the correct ink for my printer . i do not buy lower priced substitutes . it was great to find this on amazon at a good price and eligible for free shipping . i only wish amazon stocked the complete set of inks for this printer which i purchased from them .
0	the card works as advertised but sandisk does not send in mail-in-rebate . even though i mailed it in with the upc barcode , sandisk sent me a post card stating that i needed to resubmit it with the barcode . how can i resubmit when they already have the barcode ? in my experience with sandisk , i got rebate back on one of two cards that i submitted - so you get mail-in rebate 50 % of the time with sandisk . i think mail-in-rebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies . do n't trust it !
0	i am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are ! i really did enjoy the ease of tivo from pre-hd days and wanted to go back from my comcast hd dvr . i then saw the pricetag and , unlike the other people ... i can not justify spending that much money for a dvr ! it is definitely not worth it for something i get for $ 8 extra a month attached to my cable service . yes ... i do love the tivo interface and searching , but i will not pay that much for it . it feels like business suicide for tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price . knock $ 700 dollars off that retail price and i might change my mind
1	our oskar multimedia storage cabinet arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition . my husband assembled the unit with ease , until it was time to nail the card board backing on . following the instructions he laid the unit down on it 's face , of course the kick-board had already been added so it did n't lay flat . when nailing on the backing the `` j '' board ( the center shelf holding the entire unit together ) split at every point of contact . we had ordered our oskar storage cabinet through amazon , directly from ritz camera . so , naturally i called ritz to replace the `` j '' shelf . i was informed i would have to return the entire unit . i immediately pictured myself trying to get all those shelves back into the box and figured that was more trouble than i wanted to go through . so , i tracked down the number for oskar and called them directly . they were very efficient and helpful . within minutes i had their assurance that they would ship a new `` j '' shelf to my home - at no additional charge . the shelf arrived within the promised ten-days . this unit was exactly what we ordered and works well for it 's intended purpose . i would caution you to be very careful nailing on the backboard , so as not to split the center shelf . my favorite feature of the oskar multimedia wood storage cabinet is that they include plenty of extra shelves , unlike so many other brands . i have an entire stack of shelves that i can add as needed . i would love to have three or four more of these units .
0	bad customer service its been almost a month and i still have not received this product . ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything , neither did anyone answer the phones . i dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it . im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help
1	i wanted to be able to shoot lots over several days without dragging a laptop with me through multiple airports . i bought two and both worked fine , right out of the box . not the fastest card ever , but certainly large storage for the price
0	the price and some positive reviews led me to purchase this item , but after only about 1,000 pictures , all i got was corrupted data . i had the card professionally tested to ensure it was the card and nothing wrong with my camera . it definitely showed the card was the problem . luckily , i had recently done a download . wo n't trust my pictures to this brand again
0	i bought this slick looker for the desk in my office . i had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.however its tuner worked ok and i figured with the tivoli rep i 'd get some good listening along with the good looks . my office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky ... the tuner for the pa speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right . i was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal . a station would tune in nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable . i bought an amplified antenna but didnt help . then i tried it in a windowed room and same problem ... ... i was very disapointed
1	i do all my burning on a standard windows media player , and it 's almost entirely data and music , no video . for my purposes , these cd 's sound great . in some cases , it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat . that may be a trick my ears are playing on me but , nevertheless , i 'm a big fan of the memorex . and they 're a steal if you catch the sale price . recommended
0	i did n't purchase this one ... it was a gift . i was hoping for a laser printer like one of the brother all-in-ones . i opted to install the lite version of the software from hp.com . i would suggest that everyone do this . the lite version only has the drivers , none of the hp bull software that is included usually . the thing that bothered me the most was the automatic document feeder . i would start a scan job and everything is going fine , and then on the 5th or 6th page the whole process would just hang . i had over 500 pages of documents to scan , and this machine really let me down . amazing how hewlett-packard ca n't even write reliable drivers . i gave the item 2 stars because i got it to print sometimes . no buy
0	wow , how i can write a review about the item i have not received so far . i ordered this case on march 7th and to day is april 10th and it seems out of stock so far.well , i , m still waiting ... ... ..
1	this router functions great in the household environment . it is very easy to install and security is equally as easy to set .
0	i bought this humidifier reading the reviews here . but when i actually used for a few days , i found that it provided no relief from dryness while sleeping or during the day . it pretty much did nothing except make the room hotter . i would not recommend this to anyone
0	let 's be honest . this product ai n't cheap . it 's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working . i bought mine at cpenusa.com . delivery was great , only took them a couple of days . however , my c-pen cable was damaged . the connector to the c-pen was , for some reason , cut in half . without it , you ca n't recharge or connect the c-pen to the pc . i called their main office all the way in sweden during the office hours . no response . i sent three e-mails to cpenusa . no response . i do n't care if the product itself is great ( i 'll never know now , will i.. ) . if you 're unable to receive support when you need 'em , you 're screwed . if you 're just interested in electronic equipments , just want to try things out and do n't really care if you 're on your own , go ahead and try it . let me know how this thing really is . otherwise , buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after-sales support
1	i 've had two rm-ez2 for over a year now ( on different tvs ) ... very satisfactory indeed . pro : -very smooth action , easy to press buttons , fine for big clumsy fingers and poor eyesight -always works without fussy pointing -good battery life con : -eventually one will accidentally depress the wrong cbl or tv button and wonder why the remote no longer works ... the cure is simple , just depress the correct button , but if you forget that they are there , you might think the remote is broken - it 's not , it 's you . -there seems to be no way to generate the code to put your tv into setup mode - so do n't throw away the manufacturer 's original remote if you ever want to put the tv into setup mode
1	we received this item very quickly . it was exactly what we ordere
0	cases very cheaply made . break when opening . not worth shipping cost waste of money
0	it 's been over 19 days since my sandisk 512mb transflash card was `` shipped '' from emartbuy and i still have not received my order . when i contacted emartcrap , all they could tell me was that it had been shipped . i am sure that flash card works great . i just hope that i will receive it before it becomes obsolete . avoid emartbuy at all cost . do n't settle for incompetency . your are better off paying a higher price for better service ... correction any service
0	i have always bought and liked uniden phones . tried this one based on consumer reports recommendation and because i wanted caller id . awful reception - too much background noise and you can not hear the person on the other line . turn the volume to high and you get feedback from your own voice . good range ( which is useful in finding the perfectly quite place in your house to finish your call ! ) . stay clear ! ! ! ! ! !
0	the minor problem is that the user manual claims the user id is `` admin '' . well , it is not . frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user id should be left blank to log in . the major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted . after twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network . once you unplug and plug back the power cord , it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours . i am used to rebooting windows every time it hangs , but i do n't accept having a wireless access point that hangs ( i am not sure how microsoft was able to convince me it is ok for an os to hang ) . this box is going back . i already bought a buffalo that works fine
0	i bought a pv-d4744 about a year ago , it worked for a while , now it wo n't read old disks and , even with brand new disks , the chance of it being able to read the disk are not good , about 90 % of the brand new disks i have tried it wo n't read . i will never buy another panasonic product again .
1	excellent machine , great performance saved lot of time and desk space . great scanning speed and qualit
1	very very loud-enough to make you 're ears ring ( thats a good sign ) bass is very deep and the silver volume dots on one of the speakers are touch sensitive like the ipod-now thats cool . great great desktop speakers , and they can hook up right to your ipod . worth the money
1	this battery will transform your epson picturemate deluxe viewer edition from a nifty little photo printer into an absolute must have item ! i take it with me when ever i 'm doing an off-site photo shoot , or even when i 'm out for a weekend shooting candids . the portability you get by adding this battery to the printer is priceless . i have printed as many as 40 photos on one charge .
0	my title is my review . the thing worked for a week . after that it would n't power up anymore . chinese junk
0	i did the research on this product and it was one of the best . i do n't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use . i have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included . one if not the only reason i had purchased it . i e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply . if your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way
0	this product looks and feels very flimsy . do not be fooled by the flashy , metallic-looking picture . the plastic shell of this device is the quality of mcdonald 's toys . one would think that for $ 300 , the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting . the buttons are hard to press . in order to turn the device on , you have to press very firmly , which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell . the cable port for the docupen is also extremely flimsy , and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads to take place ; otherwise , the connection will be lost . i am a pre-medical student , and i very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product , believing that i could ( for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk ) scan my science textbooks in the library , including the colored diagrams , and in that way , i thought i would make back my investment , since textbooks go for at least $ 100 each . however , i now see that this belief was naive , to say the least . the docupen is extremely difficult to use . the words come out distorted , like a jammed fax machine , and although the free paper port software which comes complimentary with the docupen is rather useful for annotating pdf 's , the docupen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate . furthermore , downloading is very slow ( at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer ) , and since you ca n't see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer , you will have to re-scan about 80 % of pages due to stretches , smudges , blurriness , suspicious blank spots , and general illegibility . i wish i had read some of the other negative amazon reviews before buying this product . i would have saved myself a lot of money and time . if you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents , then this product may work okay for you , although a digital camera will probably deliver better results . if you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all-out `` paperless '' with this product , you will find yourself extremely disappointed . until planon decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi-decent shell manufacturuer , it will not a good buy . the idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential , especially when coupled with a tablet pc . however , the execution of the idea needs improvement . i hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years , at a price that is comparable to quality .
0	this remote controller was quite a dissapointment . i am using two other philips/magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better . this one does not look like the picture ( which looks more like the 425 model ) . it does not cover the equipment i have ( while the 425 model does ) , it 's learning mode is flaky and unreliable , to say the least . the range is shorter then that of the 425s . conclusion : this would make for a nice ornament ( it does look nice , and , if you are lucky you may be able to control some devices .
1	great memory card for the price . i would highly recommen
0	i have a dcs-900w camera that failed within a year . after that , i made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced . obviously i was talking to some indian people overseas that do n't seem to care about the `` service '' that much , and usually after a couple of transfers , the line got cut off or picked up by another layman . during conversation , the line quality is very bad . after a while , i just decided that $ 100 camera is not worth the time of the calls . i am in the process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau . based on my experience , i would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from d-link . once you have any problem , they just wo n't honor the waranty
0	my wife dropped the original remote and it quite working . it turns out there are pcb 's inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so i resoldered it and it worked for a little while , probably until the next time she dropped it . i bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also . could not find the problem this time . it still transmitted , but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on . i unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and i could not start the truck . i messed with it ( while in the parking lot of an amusment park ) for a long time and evetually got it to stop , probably by entering valet mode , i 'm not sure . do n't waste your money on another $ 100 remote . i am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the lcd . should be more reliable . my suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes : one lcd and one simple . better yet , buy a system that does not have the feedback , or 2 way , and save a lot of money and headache . you wo n't use it anyway
1	i have had my handspring visor deluxe for 5 ... yes , five years ( actually longer ) . while i take decent care of it , it has taken care of me . my doctor has one too ... exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced , but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to . i finally ordered a new pda with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it . ( i 'm not selling it ... good karma ) down to business - the handspring visor deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore . but in its day it was . great product and if you do n't need the bells and whistles ( or color display ) ... go for this . totally flawless . people often complain about the styli of other pdas . no complaints here . not only is it relatively comfortable , it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends ( does n't break ) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device . i literally lost my original stylus just a few days ago . the display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now , but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun ( heck , a good deal of the new ones do n't have ir ) ... go for it . and for the price i just saw it listed for on amazon ( $ 85 ) it 's a total steal . great product
1	great sound . fun colored lights . great design . love this radio
0	this is n't a consistent product . 99 % of the time , i ca n't get it to work . after months of emails and phone calls , customer service responded . what a joke ! they told me the plug in the unit and then unplug , wait 30 seconds , and then plug in . gim me a break ! i should n't have to do the hokie pokie just to get it to work . by the way , their process did n't work . poor product , poor customer service , poor price
1	very easy to assemble , has very classic lines , lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation , hard to find add-on shelf in maple . holds a lot of equipment
1	i just received these and popped 'em in and i 'm listening to mp3s on my pc . at first , one of sides was really weak in volume . in the process of testing the balance in my software , i accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys , but that apparently did the trick . now both are equal , and sound good . there is decent bass , but the highs are a bit soft . a quick tweak to my equalizer , and they 're great . after reading several of the reviews on amazon , i was a bit worried about the sound , but now that i have them i 'm very happy . they 're a good price , and sooooo much better than the little ipod-like earbuds i 've tried before . those never stayed in my ear , and the bass never made me happy . summary : these jbuds stay in my ear , have good sound ( not great , but i think good for $ 20 ) , and have equal length cords from each ear
0	this is a piece of junk . the radio reception is terrible . fm is marginal and am is almost nonexistent .
1	with all the reviews about how easy the nano scratches , i left the protective film on until i found the right case the next day at cc ( they had just received them that day ) , sorry amazon but the nano did come from you . anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the nano itself . it comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself . i have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it , but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible , it works great . it fits snugly in this case , yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update . the case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls . i have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all . the belt clip is sturdy and secure . the magnetic snap for closing it works great . the case can be closed with headphones attached , but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access . this case is as cool as the nano itself and i would very highly recommend it . i hope belkin makes the same case for the new ipod
0	well i got these headphones and connected them and realized when it played the front center channel i only got sound from the front left speaker . then the rear right channel did n't work at all . after calling tigerdirect to see about a refund . the first customer service rep was rude and unwilling to help . said we had to ship it back to them in the orginal big brown ups box with all the extra millions of packing peanuts . after getting the management on the phone they were more willing to help but its not enough . the headphones feel cheap and the wires are not color coded like everyone else uses . the instructions are lacking and the speakers that did work in them did n't sound that good at all
0	i got this for christmas 2004 . played 5 dvd 's on it and started to get the `` no disk '' reading . i only had it for 1 month . i sent it back and they are replacing it since it is under warranty but they are replacing it with a different model . we will see if it has the same problems . according to reviews of the 1700m model i expect the same . i suggest you spend a little more money and get a better dvd player
1	unit installed in seconds with no false starts or headaches of any kind . the base is wide and heavy and when placed on a mouse pad does n't move around at all , even when i get a little too `` into '' my flight sim games . one ca n't beat the price either . for flying prop planes , i am very saisfied with the performance
1	i bought this like a ipod but its better i have about 20 movies on it and about 500 songs and some photo 's and still have 50 gigs left . the only hang up is you still have to go pay another 20.00 to get the plug-in download that lets you show most of the movies . they say it can do all this stuff but not with out downloads and some add on 's once you get all that there are hours of fun to be had .
0	this product is not worth the money or trouble . i also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up . it was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up . save your money and do n't buy this . this would actually qualify for a zero star rating
0	functionally , the ifm is great . i like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch fm transmitted tv 's . however , the construction is extremely cheap . i bought two of them and both fell apart . one fell apart the second time i used it . the construction is so cheap that i could n't put it back together because the controls do n't line up . i wish there was an alternative but i ca n't find one . i like being able to switch between ipod tunes and fm , but will have to carry two devices from now on
1	great headphones for running ! they fit my ears perfectly and i do n't have to worry about foam anymore .
1	i almost bought a new phone because it was not working . the ability to purchase this battery saved me some bucks
