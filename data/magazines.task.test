1	imagine making a beehive cake or a honey-citrus iced tea . when looking through this magazine you need a good cup of tea and a pair of scissors . you will be cutting out a lot of recipes ! in fact , i 'm sitting here cutting out recipes in between typing . there are 16 pages of recipes in a `` card '' format . the favorite meal section and cooking for one or two is always of interest . it shows you how to put an entire meal together and all the recipes are included . there is also a section where you can view enviable country kitchens . then you can learn how to make ordinary foods extraordinary . add curry powder to chicken salad or add brewed coffee to cookie dough . the `` men who run the range '' section is a series featuring men who love to cook and then you can also find out what people are eating in various states across the country . these are ideas and recipes from real cooks across america . one time i looked in the `` does anyone have ... ? '' section and found a note about a woman who was looking for specific items . after sending her a small box , she then reciprocated and sent me the most beautiful framed pressed flowers . it is a fun section where you can read about recipes people are looking for and if you have the recipe , there is an address where you can mail the item . i recently learned how to make rosemary crackers and someone is looking for a recipe for various crackers . this magazine also has info on cooking schools all over the country . you could also be a field editor and share your recipes , cooking tips and other ideas with the home-office staff . you could literally end up in this magazine ! some of the delicious recipes i 've been clipping from this magazine include : grilled sirloin steak crispy fried chicken herbed seafood skewers chicken with rosemary vegetable cheese tortellini grilled turkey burgers beehive cake honey citrus iced tea tonight i made a chicken dish with homemade stuffing and a mushroom gravy that my husband really loved . i think this magazine inspires me to cook more and i have never read this magazine without tearing out pages galore . now i 'm dreaming about the pear crisp with lemon sauce and the raspberry cheesecake pie . ~therebeccareview.com
1	there are a few magazines about writing serious writers need to read . `` poets writers '' is one of them . it has a literary bent , but avoids the nose-in-the-air attitude . it is practical and educational , and is pleasingly presented . a favorite factor for me are the long feature articles on the culture of writing . in the issue out now , there are two major articles . one is about author stuart dybek and his fiction that pulls from his experience growing up on chicago 's colorful south side . the other is about writing contests , dealing with how ethical they are run , the view of literary judges , and when a writer should considering entering one . the secondary articles are as informative and as useful , whether you want to learn about promoting your book , doing online workshops or understand the trends driving the industry . contests , incidentally , are a big part of pw 's value . the magazine tells you who won , and which contests/grants are currently accepting submissions . pw is careful to screen which contests are listed , ensuring only legitimate ones make it through the editors . the writing itself is interesting . it is not always true that writing magazines are fun to read . it should be , and in the case of pw , everything is engaging . pw 's design is clean . it looks like what a small press literary magazine should look like . the typography and layout are not pretentious or overbearing , but get the job done . it is never work to read this magazine . i fully recommend `` poets writers . '' you will be better informed about writing and writers , just like the titles implies . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co
1	although i have yet to subscribe to aperture , what i 've heard and what little i 've seen advertised in one of sally mann 's famous publications is enough to arouse my interest , and i ca n't wait to partake of a first issue of 'aperture ' . feedback from other members is always anticipated and welcomed
1	i absolutely love this magazine ! it is a wonderful motivation for anyone who wants to be healthy and strong . i will be 38 in a few weeks , and am considering competing in a fitness competition because of this magazine . i read it from beginning to end , and my husband even reads it . he always asks if i saw the article on this or that , which is an indication that the information presented is useful and engaging . if you are serious about your health , want to get in shape or want to take your body to the next level , this is the magazine for you
0	i read rolling stone for the music and those who make it , not for some guilt ridden , agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics ( and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate ) is something we should all read about at nauseum . when they stick to music , it 's good , when they parade their shreiking political views , it 's boring .
1	paula 's magazine is wonderful ... unlike what one of the reviewers wrote about the recipes being bland . they are all from paula 's cookbooks , new recipes or from her friends . none are bland ... they are pure paula and all have the wonderful southern flare she is known for . i have been fortunate enough to meet paula in person and was at a recent taping of her new t.v . show paula 's party ... this magazine is just another wonderful extention of her many talents !
0	yes , t is the oldest continually published magazine in the usa , and it 's their 160th anniversary . however , i see little reason to celebrate . why ? because i fail to see how it 's really improved over the years . nowadays , this magazine seems to cater far too much to the material lusts of the `` nouveau riche '' . back in the day when it was a true `` high society '' magazine , there were rather interesting and educational articles on the arts , literature and culture . it was beautiful and it really gave a person something to aspire to , but now just like so much of the rest of society has mutated into a lot of pretentious materialist wannabees bragging about `` bling bling '' , so has this magazine . there are far too many adverts for so-called `` luxury goods '' for my tastes , and although they put in a patronizing article about women over age 60 being the new `` power '' base , they insist on using only thin 20-something models who probably ca n't afford the clothes they are modeling ! articles wise , they are starting to sound more like glamour or cosmo than the erudite publication i used to enjoy buying on the newsstands 20 years ago . yes , t has changed with the times ... but these are not good times if that is the case . it 's too bad
0	was very dissapponted with this magazine . they go unread and get thrown out . just waiting for our subscription to run out . it is really for older kids and of very little interest to younger kids
1	i recieve different magazines over the course of a year . i do n't know why . it simply happens that way . marie claire is a pleasant surprise . i found in the first issue i read , a group of writers , editors and all involved with this magazine , not just writing about issues , but being proactive . everyone on the street in nyc in bikinis and whatever each individual felt comfortable with , to bring awareness to skin cancer . really cool ! each issue has write ups on a certain amount of relevant international and national news for women and other sexes too . they are adding the right amount of consciousness to an otherwise totally fashion magazine which also i have found surprisingly refreshing and fun . ace job marie claire staff ! !
1	the new yorker has made it 's way to our kitchen table since i was tall enough to see over the edge of the table . my mom was an avid reader and now i buy the magazine , cause she would have wanted it that way . i like it for the cartoons and i 'm absolutely naive when it comes to politics , so i need this magazine to get some idea of what is going on . with all the blogging and other nonsense , i feel secure that the new yorker does diligent fact checking before it prints something , so i rely on it where i wo n't rely on news printed on the internet . regards , lar
0	my mom was a subscriber to newsweek for years , and i 'd flip through her copies . most of the material is friendly towards the powers that be ( although , not friendly enough according to the review by the soldier who thinks the editors should be in jail . so much for `` protecting our freedoms '' ) . anyway , since newsweek is beholden to big business advertisements , it wo n't do much to rock the boat that our corporate mafia owns . if people are interested in more honest , more critical views of the political and economic system that is causing so much devastation in the world ( the neoliberalism of the us empire and other wealthy nations ) , then i 'd recommend z magazine . i 'll never forget finding my mom on the floor devouring it 's articles on a range of issues the corporate media marginalize . z also publishes articles and interviews with the most-cited living author on the planet , noam chomsky ( another figure i 'm sure the us soldier thinks should be in jail . although , chomsky recently spoke at west point . so , even the military is waking up to the hard truths he brings ) .
1	i dont know what can i write . i want anything about art exactly about painting , drawing , modern ar
0	this magazine is another part of the murdoch empire . its worst sin is that its boring and not very conservative . it was founded by william kristol , john podhoretz and fred barnes to be a institutional conservative publication under tight control and with deep enough pockets to dwarf its smaller rivals . when conservativism was a living movement , it was best characterized as a collection of independent voices who while they respected each other did n't always agree with each other . now , following the murdoch formula , its about getting as many people whatever their ideology on the payroll . the price of being on the payroll is of course not rocking the boat . reading conservative publications these days is like reading the transcripts of someone engaging in a monologue in an echo chamber . its strange that there is so much `` conservative '' media today , but that most policy decisions do n't get debated or even discussed among conservatives . they seem more interested in covering liberals than discussing ideas or making proposals . and for god 's sake , no more articles by those who are agnostics in their private life talking about how america needs more god this or god that . if your going to be religious , at least find someone who is sincere . and no more articles on the greatness of family by childless unmarried women who are totally devoted to careers to the exclusion of anything else .
1	i got american girl when i was nine . and now im going on my thirteenth birthday and still love it . i think you can be intreseted in teen people type magazines but still love american girl . it has lots of crafts and my favorite part-the `` lunch box '' section where they have ideas for food to make and take in your lunch to school . it is a short magazine , but they make up for it by having the jumbo summer issue . i think its definitaly worth the money .
1	`` the economist '' is a great weekly magazine with in-depth , balanced and enlightening journalism . the articles are largely expertly written by knowledgeable people . the writing in `` the economist '' is interesting and insightful with articles conveying detailed and yet condensed information . the magazine has contributions from senior people from all over the world , making it interesting and relevant to a worldwide readership . the editors and journalists of the economist need to be applauded for the broad range of well-written articles with balanced analysis every week . reading this magazine ensures that i know what is happening worldwide every week , although i do not always agree with some positions the magazine takes . this is recommended reading for business leaders and decision makers who require a diverse range of views and information about what is happening at different places in the world on subjects as diverse as politics , current affairs , science and technology , national , regional and global issues , finance , trade , and development . even great people like nelson mandela relied on this magazine for news during his long years in prison .
1	this is a magazine i frequently get confused with foreign affairs magazine . the primary difference is the longer well-written essays by leading experts in affairs whereas foreign policy has a more frequently published , more up to date and more direct version of the other . it would be great to have both since policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail . if you do n't have a lot of time to read , policy is the one you 'll need and enjoy .
0	i'de have never read vibe in the first place , but i won a free years subscription in some online contest . and i must also mention i 'm a huge fan of hip-hop and hip-hop culture , so i'de think vibe would be tight ... ..daamn , was i ever wrong . first off , half the mag is advertising ... .then what little reading there is ... .it 's all bullsh** . the interviews they have with artists are totally weak watered down . they never ask any worthwhile questions . vibe also contradicts itself constantly . in one issue , they 'll give an album a low rating a poor review , then at the end of the year they name that same album one of the years best ... .what the f*** ? vibe has it 's decent moments , but i def . wo n't be paying for it anytime soon .
1	i use this magazine for my three kids ( ages 9 , 11 , and 13 ) who are homeschooled . they love the magazine because it makes history more fun than dry textbooks and they get to really experience what life was like in a certain era . each article includes discussion questions , activities , movies , web sites and additional books to read . what is so great about this is that when one of the kids is really interested in something , they can jump off and explore more on their own - perfect for self-directed learning . and it saves me time in tracking down this stuff . some of the more memorable articles were ones like `` how to storm a castle '' , `` hobo signs in the depression '' , `` success in ancient china '' and `` how chocolate conquered europe '' - definitely not standard-fare topics , but fun nonetheless . my kids are getting hooked on history as a result ! sure , it 's $ 5 per issue , but it 's pretty thick ( 60+ pages ) and has no ads . you can check out a sample issue online on their web site to see if it is right for your kids
0	i ordered this magazine a year ago , and my nephew still have n't receive a single magazine ! every time i email customer service they would tell me that it 's coming next month . i will let you how the magazine is when i get it , but do n't hold your breath .
0	i paid i never received magazine at all even though i received all four of the other magazines that were ordered at the same time
0	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports . their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing , for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be # 1 in ranking . often , the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that is n't relevant , or does n't make sense , or the review is n't consistent with the posted viehicle stats . the magazine also seems to be biased . some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful . after further reading of many issues , you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers , for example , you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically `` trash '' and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go , when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews . ultimately , its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period . its the pat robertson of auto magazines . if it were possible , i woudl n't even give this magazine 1 star .
0	this is my favorite magazine in the universe and the only one to which i have ever subscribed . however , after this , my second subscription is over , i plan to call it quits . the magazine never gets delivered unless i send several angry e-mails every month reminding them and demanding delivery . when the issues come they are often 2-3 months behind . the current issue is over three weeks late and who knows when and if i will ever see it . in the end , although this is a brilliant publication , it simply is n't worth the headache . photo , if you 're out there , please forward me the june issue ... . and while you 're at it get a head start on july and august and maybe they 'll make it on time
1	this magazine has great recipies ! most of them are incredibly easy , but there are a few `` adventuresome '' ones every once in a while to try when you feel up to a challenge . sometimes the recipies need a few more spices , so i usually add more than they say ( heck , it does n't change the calorie count ) . however , cooking light does not trade calories for taste , so the whole family likes the meal and there are many recipies that i would proudly serve to company ( the majority , in fact ) . there are also just a ton of recipies per issue . the only negative things i would say is that a few of the recipies are only marginally `` healthy '' and sometimes there 's some redundancy . overall , it 's a great buy
1	runners world covers everything about running from which shoes and why to race preparation to nutrition and technique . there is no magazine better for runners
1	golf digest is the best magazine , covers great players , have standard lessons from top golf teachers and schools and allways very useful tips . however , it only has one thing against ... too much advertising or too many advertisers ! !
1	when the armchair detective stopped being published , i was without a good mystery magazine . i received a complimentary copy of mystery scene and i subscribed to it . the magazine is published 5 times per year and features great interviews and good book reviews . i especially enjoy their reviewing lesser known authors and books by independent publishers . my favorite part is the `` where are they now '' which features authors who seem to have stopped writing a particular series , many of whom i have read in the past . an excellent publication
1	i discovered the am some 2 or 3 years ago . since then , i have become an addicted reader to it . more than to any other magazine at the moment . let 's start saying what the am is not : is not about news , is not about business , is not about nice and colored pictures . the am has two main focuses . one is current affairs , with a special focus on the macro conditions of the us ( mainly economy and politics ) and international affairs . the other one is the arts , with a special focus in reviewing high-quality ( and sometimes rare ) books . i like the am for its focus in current affairs . in this monthly you will read long articles about issues like , to cite some examples that come to mind : - simulation of a principals meeting to discuss alternatives to engage with north korea - war game of an attack to iran - presidential candidates , their lives and their campaign strategies - state of affairs of the american educational system - potential causes of an eventual economic crisis in the us the am sits in the same `` hall of fame '' as the economist and foreign affairs . the main differences are that the economist has a relatively short time frame and thus focuses on the news of the week and what they mean for the mid term . foreign affairs , on the other hand , is more scholarly in nature . the am sits somehow in the middle . it is written mainly by senior journalists ( so it 's less scholarly ) and its monthly focus allows it to disentangle itself from the relative `` sameness '' of every week 's news . the am goes beyond the `` futility '' of news reporting but stops before it gets into the `` boringness '' of scholarly writing . if you want to enrich your view of the world with a quality monthly , if you are open-minded and are willing to read new points of view , if you want to get closer to the real issues behind foreign and economic policy , the am is for you . on the other hand , if you have more `` short-term '' preocupations , if you are more `` closed '' than open to new points of view , or if you want to look at international and economic matters with a more scientific approach , then the am is not for you . again , as i said , the am also has an `` arts '' section . it 's very good but it 's not the reason why i buy it . other may
1	'sports illustrated ' is the one sports magazine which covers in a good way all the major sports . it has been a feature of american life for over half a century . one of the features i recently took great interest in reading was its list of the one- hundred greatest sports books .
0	for ads only pretty much . there is not much to read or learn for the common reader . it seems like it 's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone .
1	this magazine is fun and upbeat . the pictures are bright and colorful but more importantly they add to the text . if the text is about cooking a steak for example the pictures will be clear and easy to understand and will fully document what the text is saying . there are many many recipes . one section actually has a pull out shopping list and menus for a week . a great magazine . well worth the money .
0	i 'm referring to the u.k version of this magazine but my sentiments are the same as that written by most of the other reviewers . this mag has deteriorated so much over the last few years . i recent ; y discouraged my son from reading this magazine as it almost resembled a soft porn mag ! also , if you were to follow the routines in this magazine , you will just end up overtrained and frustrated with your lack of results . why ? the rotuines listed here only work if you have 6 days a week and two hours a day to train . and it also requires that you live on supplements ! most of the 'champs ' feautured in this magazine are just paid to say they use the supplements . in reality they are all surgically enhanced and are on large amounts of anabolic hormones . there is no way the routines in this mag will work for typical people . please look elsewhere
0	i was ecstatic when i received this magazine subscription as as gift . two issues into my subscription it stopped . i was really anticipating the december issue because i had many guests coming and could use some of martha 's helpful advice , however it never came and neither did january or february . i have called martha stewart living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic , i still have not received another issue . when i asked to cancel for a refund i was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up - being that it was a gift this is useless . very clever for martha and very frustrating for the giftee/consumer
0	why pay $ 34 when you can buy the magazine at a bookstore and order a subscription for $ 19.9
1	the london review of books is , without a doubt the best literary journal in the world : at the same time erudite , entertaining and informative , each issue is a foray into a world of knowledge that is all too lacking in other publications and media . there was a time in my life when i could n't afford to put my heating on in the bitterly cold british winter , but i never thought to cancel my subscription to the lrob . highly recommended
1	`` the wall street journal '' is nothing less than america 's true newspaper of record , a window on the world of business , finance , international affairs , and all the delicious little nuggets of news that would otherwise slip through the cracks . i am a media carnivore : i am news-addicted . i get my news in hourly , massive slabs : from cnbc , from cnn , from the internet -- -and best of all , in the brain-shatteringly early hours of the morning in the form of my daily wall street journal ( kudos goes , as well , to my unfailingly faithful early-rising journal deliveryman ) . with that high praise i also must dispatch a warning to the curious : if you subscribe to the journal -- -and if you want to be informed and ahead of the game , then you must ! -- -you 'll discover , possibly for the first time , intense agonies of guilt . the journal is , every single day , chock full of so many juicy , delicious , insanely informative , amazingly well-written , positively balanced nuggets of journalism on finance , politics , economics , technology , market trends , literary explosions -- -so much , in fact , that it 's an embarrassment of riches . if you 're busy -- -and who is n't ? -- -then you simply wo n't have time to read everything . like caesar 's roman gaul , the wall street journal is also divided into three parts : the front page , marketplace , and money investing . page one is my beachhead in the morning : i scan the middle two columns for the financial and geopolitical earth movers -- -and if i have the time , i can dig into the paper for all the gory details . the news here is uniformly objective : opinion is cut out , the wounds cauterized , and the unbiased opinion itself served up piping hot on the journal 's editorial page . marketplace deals with macro and micro business trends , and is always engagingly written . sometimes the supplement `` personal journal '' accompies the fleet out ; more often than not , there 's another tasty little section dealing with mutual funds , technology trends , industry strategies , and quite a bit more . it 's a veritable treasure-house of knowledge , and since gordon gekko was right -- -the most valuable commodity in the world is information -- -the wall street journal serves as purveyor of that most critical , that most precious commodity . and , i might add , serves it up with spice , brains , guts and panache . oh , and money investing is a fly-by of all the major financial trends of the day : m , economics , currency , commodities , oil making investors shake and quake , big stock movers . all good stuff . finally -- -and i 'm biased , be warned -- -the editorial page is the best on the planet , and i always scour it at lunch -- -always . if you want to be informed -- -if you want to be light years ahead of your arch-rival , that nasty vp of finance hastings down the hall , which naturally you do -- -you should at the very least read the editorial page . it is incisive , delicious , never boring , brimming with opinion and intelligence . yum . the journal is with me in the nosebleed hours of the early morning , right beside my boiled eggs and toast and steaming cup ( s ) of coffee . and it 's with me in the evening , when i actually get to dip into it , at leisure , with my cigar and scotch . so subscribe to it , i say : the wall street journal is an important , glorious , massively influential american institution . it 's your window on the world of affairs . it 's what the movers and shakers of the british empire might have read had the empire survived into the 21st century : and yes , you have the news of the world , at your fingertips , hauled back from the journal 's far-flung outposts across the globe : from hong kong , london , kuala lumphur . sincere kudos to the journal 's officer corps : karen elliott house , the publisher ; paul steiger , managing editor ; and paul gigot , editorial page editor -- -and the brilliant , dedicated , blindingly talented team of reporters that work with them . bravo ! for a decade now , not a morning has dawned without my journal : it is my polestar and compass . it makes me richer , which makes me happier . it is a tasty read . stop gawking and subscribe .
0	i am still not receiving this magazine . and i had a gift subscription on that order , too . i 've been meaning to get in touch . thought it had been more than long enough for subscription to start
1	when funds were tight i had a difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions to keep . each women 's magazine has a slightly different feel in the writing , though with increased competition , these styles seem to be in flux . i finally decided that i preferred the writing in bazaar and was getting tired of what i felt was vogue 's cosmopolitan attempt to catch a larger readership ( if i want to subscribe to cosmo , i 'll bloody well subscribe ) . the featured designers are more cutting edge and less mainstream than what is found in vogue . it 's a bit snottier ( though there are far snottier magazines if you are looking for extreme fashions ) . among my complaints : bazaar is an obviously thinner magazine , and while most of vogue 's content is adverts , it does seem to have more articles . another item that i find highly irritating , is bazaar 's society items . i really do n't give a -- -- who is wearing what at what charity gala , especially when i do n't play footsies with these people . those complaints aside , this is still my favorite fashion magazine
1	a beautiful magazine - this one 's a classic ! not to be missed by all anglophiles .
1	i picked up a copy of dwell in my brother 's mod condo he owns and thought , oh , not another boring design magazine . wow . i was really impressed with both the great pictures and the range of topics in this little gem . from `` chairs through the ages '' to a complete timeline of modern design ( toasters to ipods ! ) i just could n't stop saying `` ahhhh '' ! since this magazine is not available in many places ( such as the supermarket ) , it 's well worth a subscription . there are wonderful ideas for small spaces but also for larger homes too . it would make a great gift for a 20 something that is just getting into their first space . ( and hey , having it on your coffee table makes your hipness go up by about 100 % ~ ! )
1	this bimonthly magazine is a wish book for those of us who do n't have two full-time gardeners on staff , or a few acres of woods to devote to bluebells , or the ruins of an ancient abbey to train roses against . my regency ancestors were breaking their backs on hardscrabble new england farms , rather than building follies or planting mazes , or having their grounds landscaped by capability brown . oh , but what if ... . i 've subscribed to `` the english garden '' for many years now , and i do n't think i 've ever gotten anything useful out of it , but the gardens photographed within its glossy pages are to dream for : acres of blooming rhododendrons ; statuesque old sequoias that were planted when victoria was queen ; lavender hedges ; outdoor rooms that have been replanted to a 17th century plan ; a sundial pool ; and of course , a bluebell wood . there are plenty of suggestions for the serious gardener . for example , the current issue ( july 2005 ) features the following : * for year round colour , buy a couple of peacocks . their screams will also scare away the burglars * one gentleman favors beer for slugs , `` although i do n't dare use it here - the gardeners would drink it ! '' * hazel twigs bent over beds and urns will deter the peacocks * add a touch of history to your garden with an italian carved white marble seat . it can be picked up at sotheby 's garden statuary sale for a mere 25,000 - 40,000 pounds . ( i absolutely lust for this bench , but alas my pension must be spent elsewhere ) * `` use perfumed plants in the conservatory because the warmth generated by the glass pumps fragrance through the house '' * plant marigolds in your walled kitchen garden to keep `` eelworm and whitefly at bay '' * flank the path to the summerhouse with rhododendrons and white narcissi * to break up a long path , use arches `` lightly clothed with jasmine or clematis '' if some of the above tips are a bit too steep for your pocketbook , you can do like me and drool over the marvelous photographs of someone else 's jasmine arch and italian carved marble .
1	there is never a dull moment with this magazine ! you never know what the next story is going to be ... just that it will be a great read ! really good photography and illustrations too ! so if you are interested in what makes this world tick ... check out smithsonian magazine
1	i ordered this on may 5th for mother 's day , and was advised that the actual subscription may take 6-8 weeks , but that a card would be mailed to my mother within 3 days . it was not mailed until june 27th , she still does not believe i was thinking of her on mother 's day . as of june 30 , she still has not received her first magazine either . allow extra time when ordering if it is for a timely item
0	this mag needs a new editor . i have n't seen anything interesting in better homes for six months . maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests
1	the american spectator offers an eloquent and often humorous conservative viewpoint on the more pressing political and cultural issues facing the world today . the emphasis here is `` conservatism '' , not `` republicanism '' as tas is often highly critical of gop politics and policies that stray from conservative ideals . publications like tas counter the insidious , tendentious underpinings of the mainstream media , hollywood , and the mistake that is the united nations . i recommend you at least give it a look . samples of its content can be found at www.spectator.or
0	not nearly as appealing as the other magazines i have read : motortrend , car and driver , automobile mag , sport compact . i do n't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars . car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny
1	i have been scrapbooking for more than five years , and i my style is rather simple . however , i recently found myself in a rut , and i began wishing i could do the fancier pages , so i began receiving creating keepsakes . although i still have no desire to do a two page spread that takes 5+ hours , this magazine has been great at inspiring me to try new things , as well as just giving me ideas for both scrapbooking and stamping , in just the first three issues of my subscription . they do a fairly good job of showing the expensive way to do a page , as well as the more economical . additionally , there are product reviews and recommendations . i typically buy most of my supplies from at-home parties , i found a very helpful recommendation for a silent eyelet setter . some of their articles are geared towards the more advanced/ambitious scrapbooker . for instance , a recent article explained how to use certain computer programs to augment photos . the results were beautiful , but this was just not up my alley . they also recently did a spread on the scrapooking rooms of some of their staff , and i was very , very jealous ! i may never have any award-winning spreads , and i probably will never use my computer to augment my pictures , but i know my scrapbooking will be more creative and better looking due to this magazine
0	i suscribed to this magazine since i got a great offer on it from the company i get my other suscriptions from so i decided , why not ? ? its been a year and , although the previews of each week 's prime-time programs are fun ( 2 pages worth ) i was very dissapointed . the articles are empty , boring and some downright retarded ; rehashing show 's dialogues , requoteing newscomments - its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around . i realize this is an entertainment magazine , but still , the articles in people magazine seem like rocket science in comparison - gasp ! ! ! do yourself a favor and just buy a tv guide - much more interestin
1	i love this magazine ( not because of the big ole booty 's ) , because of the way they present the ladies . i have never seen a cover of king showing some skinny , no meat eating , starving her self to death type chic ! they show real women , with real shapes . it shows how women look in the real world ! i love it , and yeah i must admit , i do love the big ole booty 's ! ! sorry ladies , i am a man ! lol
1	the most amazing thing about american iron is their tech articles . pictures are used to illustrate various steps in a process and , unlike most of the other harley rags ' , the photos are crisp and detail the step ! they really seem geared to a joe average reader who is not milling out the bore of their bike on a regular basis
1	my husband is a watercolor artist and we used to order this magazaine directly . now with the amazon service , we not only get the magazine a little cheaper , we get it renewed easily via emails from them . excellent service
1	this magazine compares favorably to `` american heritage '' with its interesting and accessible but well-researched accounts of the past . each issue focuses on a person ( i just read the story of thomas aquinas -- and had n't realized his fascinating interaction with muslims ) or a movement ( the huguenots , who 's sad history led to their dispersal from france to all over the world -- including the revere family moving to massachusetts ) . all in all , an intriguing glimpse at how christians of the past continue to influence us today
0	i ordered this as a gift for my neice for christmas . it 's june , and she has yet to get a copy . i called them in march , and they verified they have her correct name and address in their computer . i 'll going to ask for a refund
0	i started ordering glamour 2 months ago , and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me . there are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable . ladies , my advice is to save your money for a different magazine..i dont recommend glamour at all .
1	people is a great magazine ! it has all the gossip without the drama of some of the other magazines . i got my first issue faster than expected ! i ordered sept. 22nd and have been reading for 3 or 4 weeks already ! : ) if you are looking for a weekly mag - this is the one to pick !
0	amazon sells a one year subscription for $ 14 which includes a $ 5 amazon certificate that you get later . in the actual magazine , the subscription card is 6.99 for one year or 2 years for $ 10.00 so use the card , save some money and also dont have to wait for your $ 5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the $ 5 certificate on .
1	our ranger rick issues are used first as reading material , then discussion material , then project material ( cut-outs , etc ) then recycling to neighbors who enjoy them just as much . tear out posters line my son 's walls . there is no objectionable material in the magazine , just wholesome , fun reading . no political agenda is discernable from it , which is refreshing . as soon as it comes in the mail , my 10 year old insists on sitting right down and reading the whole thing through . the knowledge the magazine imparts carries over into the school day , where his teacher is amazed at his recall and knowledge .
0	i hate this magazine . i subscribed sight-unseen based on the good reviews , and find the recipes are for food that no one in my house would ever eat ... way too exotic . if you like good ol ' american fare , do n't buy this one
0	although 'camping life ' does contain a nice article or two each issue , the thrust of the magazine seems more to be a showcase of nice big campers/rv 's rather than the experience of camping and related camping activities . i subscribed sight unseen from the boy next door who was selling subscriptions for school . i will definitely let this subscription lapse . there 's just not enough love of camping and the outdoors in the magazine . however , if your camping interests run more to great big rv 's and all the related gear , you might find some value here that i did not
0	psychology today is just another glamour/cosmo/people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology . this magazine used to be well-written and had more scientific data . however , since the appointment of the new editor , headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over . if you are interested in scientific data and research , this is not the magazine for you . i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all
1	this magazine is like no other . the interviews are fantastic , the pictures are great , and it 's very original . i can understand people not liking it if they 're used to and prefer the typical , predictable magazine format . it 's not for everyone , but for people of a certain people , it 's heaven
0	it is impossible to review this item as item was never received . i have found it very difficult to contact anyone to find out where this item is
1	okay so the pictures of the girls are not my thing but where else can you read a fresh look about cars , eating healthy and fashion ? ladies , this is a must read in order to talk to men ! it features fun topics sure to entertain and assist in carrying conversation with all the guys
1	i started reading the economist after a recommendation from a professor during my undergrad years . that was 9 years ago . reason blended with wit and intelligence , the articles in the economist are a perfect antidote to the often insipid stuff put out by conventional newspapers . once i get my weekly edition , you could n't blow-torch it out of my hands ( my wife has tried ) . the economist is one of the few newspapers that has consistently defended the classical liberal perspective . free markets , civil liberties , and skepticism of those in power . in my opinion , it has no competitors . i could n't rate it highly enough
1	i have been a smart money subscriber for over three years . i must say that each month i look forward to receiving the new issue . it needs to be said ( to those who are n't aware ) that this is a publication of the wall street journal . there is n't as much market news but the writing is just as good . from undervalued stock picks , to mutual fund screening and research , finding cheap bottles of good wine , car ratings , retirement planning and portfolio health - this magazine hits on many important topics for people in their working years . i find the writing to be accurate and insightful . i would still be a subscriber if the subscription was $ 3 per issue . that 's the true value i find in it . hands down it 's the best personal finance magazine around . head and shoulders above money kiplingers
0	order placed early june . first issue of subscription not yet received . this is service
0	ca n't give a review on maximum pc . never received the magazine . instead i was sent the men 's magazine fhm . please send my maximum pc
1	i just received the latest issue of the green guide , titled 12 top products , and it 's a great issue . lots of good shopping info
0	i decided that i had to write a review about newsweek this morning , after i came across yet another biased , over-hyped cover story . this particular one is entitled , `` rethinking the marriage crunch , '' and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman 's chances of getting married later in life . this was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around , and neglected to have any on this occasion . i really think another reviewer 's comparison to people is quite apt , but newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue . two years ago , we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning `` infidelity chic . '' yes , it seems , according to their sources , spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue , without even a hint of contradiction , that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before . i find the magazine to be [ ... ] as they offer opinion instead of news ; theirs is a mission of persuasion . overall , there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool .
1	overall , this is the best gaming magazine i have read . it covers all consoles , gives sensible ( and funny ) reviews , and previews the hottest upcomming games . most games are reviewed by two people , adding to the accuracy of the score . it has a rating of 1-10 , 10 being the best , a rating which precious few games recieve . the previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games . some of them are one page long , some ten . they all include pictures , and most have an estimated release date . also , there is a section on news in the game industry . ususlly near the beginning of the magazine , they include news on developers , consoles , and the big names in the industry . all in all , this is a great magazine , and well worth your money , because each issue is well over 100 pages
1	i just renewed my subscription to glamour because they are one of the only magazines i have ever read that feature both a significant amount of affordable items ( i.e . less than $ 100 ) as well as intelligent , relevant articles about women and men . sure , they have their `` off '' months , but i really appreciate that ads do n't tend to dominate the magazine as much as others ( especially for as low as the subscription rate is ) . i also ca n't wait to see the `` do 's and don'ts '' every month
0	i never received this magazine so how would i be able to rate it ? ? i cant even find a way to let them know i never received it
0	i started ordering glamour 2 months ago , and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me . there are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable . ladies , my advice is to save your money for a different magazine..i dont recommend glamour at all .
1	as a reader , i become totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of books that come out each month . i usually rely on friends ' recommendations and more word-of-mouth advice , but that 's never been enough for me . reading a book is an investment to me , and i want to make sure my time is well spent . bookmarks gives me the confidence that i 'm choosing the books i truly want to read . i also find that the author profiles in bookmarks are timely and relevant to my broad tastes ( such as the ones on mario vargas llosa and the very interesting japanese writer , yukio mishima , which also shows that bookmarks looks globally , not only regionally , for classic authors ) .
1	with its cheap pricetag and thick size , fantasy science fiction is definately one of the best . it splits it pages into fantasy science fiction stories and novellas with a few common columns between ( book reviews and strange facts ) . if you write fantasy or science fiction , pick magazine up
0	a great magazine . i had a subscription for 2 years that ended about 6-8 months ago . i paid $ 104 for the 2 year subscription back then , but suddenly the price in the us has skyrocketed astronomically . i can go to any music store or a borders/barnes and noble and buy each individual magazine for anywhere from $ 8/issue to $ 9/issue typically , and i have never seen it more than $ 9/issue . however , suddenly the subscription they have is like $ 13 an issue , which is outrageous . it 's not amazon 's doing either , i was a subscriber for 2 years and this same thing happened to me . they asked me to come back at a lower rate ( something like $ 99/year ) , which is still $ 8.25 an issue . sure that 's might be a bit cheaper ( about 25 cents an issue on the average price above ) than buying each one in the store , but i doubt anyone would want every single issue individually , especially at tthat price . the upside is that uncut is far and away the best music/movie magazine in the world . i 'd say about 60-70 % of the issues i would have bought in the store when i was a subscriber . but until they begin printing the magazine in the states , it 's just not worth a subscription . the writing of the magazine is superb . brilliant and varied writing throughout . each magazine is about as big as a small book too , and of them i 'd read a good 80 % of the magazine too ( even finding myself reading some articles about artists i could care less about , because the articles were so well written ) , but the price is way too high to subscribe . it 's a shame too . rolling stone is nowhere close to being as good as uncut , and although mojo and q are strong , they ca n't hold the candle to it either . the only blemish on the magazine itself ( for all you who might want to buy a single issue ) is that the covers tend to repeat every 3-4 months , and i mean how much beatles can i read ( and i 'm in the upper 5 % of beatle freaks out there ) . still the magazine is well worth it , the subscription price is too incredibly high though to recommend in any circumstances . i would think this would be a great market to move into in the us if i was in that position . i do n't think rolling stone could compete anymore . if it would make things cheaper , i would do away with the `` free cd '' bonus too . aside from a few listens and the novelty of it all ( the free cd was a good incentive to make me interested a few years back ) , the cd 's get old quick , and after a while i would toss them out after a quick preview . summary : wait until/if the price drops , but do n't subscribe . it 's too expensive , and much cheaper to buy each magazine individually . the magazine itself though is 5 stars and almost always great
0	the thing i hate about this magazine is the letters to the editor section . supposedly , they 're written by real people . but after reading this magazine for the last few years , these letters all seem to have the same maudlin , soporific , sappy style of prose that reads to me like they 've been edited that way . there 's this condescending `` athletes are supposed to behave like good ladies and gentlemen and if they do n't , then tsk tsk - what will the children think ? '' mentality that i absolutely hate . the good things about si are the photography and whatever articles on the nba they have any given week . and the swimsuit issue ? i guess if you 're a 13-14 year old it 's exciting as all get out - i 'll take the hard stuff any day over their annual fleshfest
1	as an author i find oprah 's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month . `` divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act . everyone deserves intimacy-emotional and physical . if a gay or bisexual man loves his wife , her happiness will be more important to him than his own . setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be , is the ultimate expression of love . '' dennis j. schleicher
1	this magazine is by far the best food , travel magazine out . a bit on the expensive side due to it coming from bbc in england but worth every pound ... dollar
1	when weird tales was revived around 1988 , i was sorely disappointed in the direction the editorial staff had taken . it was too `` progressive '' and not enough like the old wt so many of us afficionados knew and loved . lin carter had a great thing going for the four paperback issues he came out with under the zebra imprint in the early 1980 's . unfortunately , he was not allowed to continue . his idea was to keep the flavor of the old weird tales alive , and he did it very well . then several years later along comes the the schweitzer/scithers/betancourt wt , and my goodness it was sad to see the aura gone . gradually , though , wt has seemed to come along and put itself somewhat more in the direction of the `` old-fashioned '' 'zine it was in its heyday ( 1920's-1930 's ) , although the editor darrell schweitzer would probably disagree with this observation . anyway , wt sports great covers now , good stories , and good book reviews , and interesting editorials . i must say i miss s.t . joshi 's always very entertaining book reviews , but we ca n't have everything . scott connors ' forthcoming reviews will surely entertain , as do douglas winter 's . all fantasy lovers should buy this magazine to support the cause of fantastic literature , especially the dark fantastic ; there are so few outlets of this kind now that whispers and weirdbook , not to mention the long gone forgotten fantasy , are no longer published . good job , mr. schweitzer , whether you realize it or not , your magazine has become a more cozy , old-style , aesthetically pleasing magazine , more in the true tradition of the original weird tales , thanks in no small part to the wonderful covers that have graced it in the last 13 or 14 years
1	this magazine is great , ive thumbed thru 2 issues @ my salon , and i love it , there is so much information on black hair care , fashion , beauty etc . i think it might be the best black hair care magazine ive seen . i wish it was readily available in more stores !
1	we just renewed this subscription for my wife 's mom , who lives in an assisted living facility nearby . she has thoroughly enjoyed the magazine and the residents have used the material as a discussion/project starter . thanks for your efforts at capturing this material and providing it for others
0	this publication has no business calling itself a `` magazine '' ; published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies , this is nothing more than a fluffy info-mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo . do n't waste your money
0	occasionally when i go to the grocery store i pick up a magazine by the check out counter . so i bought an issue of fitness magazine and then decided to get a subscription . i do n't know what the heck i was thinking . each time i got the issue i noticed there was always some skinny blond chick on the cover wearing a bikini . there were never any women of color on the cover . so when i was sent a letter , asking if i 'd like to renew my subscription , i said he11 no . i 'm not wasting my money on a so-called fitness magazine that does n't feature women of color on its cover . there 's just no way . i thought fitness was for everybody , not just for skinny blondes who wear bikinis . and just because your skinny does n't make you `fit ' either . skip this if possible
1	the best weekly news magazine on the market , time also gives science and technology updates , movie reviews , some celeb news , and provocative articles on world trends . well worth a subscription , especially if you do n't have time for the nightly new
1	a woman that is passionate about beautiful things writes this review . i am an avid do-it-yourselfer and love to do things around the house . this magazine has been one of my favorites for years . i look forward to each new issue and the decorating ideas that it will provide . this magazine concentrates on upscale decorating , architecture and landscapes . many of the articles feature european country looks . the photographs in this magazine are absolutely beautiful . the july / august 2006 edition contained the following : 1 . venetian villa ( adrienne vittadini in sarasota florida ) 2 . nantucket renewal ( enlarging a classic cottage ) 3 . blooming intensity ( saturated with color ) 4 . coastal hues ( seaside radiance captured ) 5 . british accent ( this side of the pond ) 6 . the art of dining 7 . the view from veranda ( summer place ) 8 . tableaux ( staged elegance ) 9 . personal luxury ( cool coral ) 10 . on exhibit ( jungles in paris ) 11 . trade secrets ( summertime : fabrics , rugs , lighting ) 12 . passions ( birds of paradise : home aviary design ) 13 . showcase ( summer seating : for pool and porch ) 14 . verdant paths ( annevoie : belgium 's water garden ) 15 . the last word ( vanity flair : adrienne vittadini sketchbook ) there are many photographs of this magazine of both house interiors and exteriors that i find to be very inspirational from a decorating perspective . if you are looking for either painting or decorating ideas this magazine has much to offer . i have replicated some of the interiors in my own home . the exterior photographs of this magazine are always very appealing . i have been slowing changing the landscaping on my property to reflect a more italian way of life . i think you will be inspired to create an alfresco dining space after you have seen some of the beautiful landscape photographs . the merchants that advertise in this magazine are fabulous . i have purchased many items from them and have always been happy with my purchases . i highly recommend this magazine to anyone that loves interior design , or just likes nice things . this magazine is top notch all the way .

0	i wish i had something good to say but i ordered this barron 's subscription back in august 06 . i 've had this newspaper before and do enjoy it . it is now november and i 'm still waiting . i called customer service and amazon promised to resolve but that was several weeks ago . my next call will be to ask for my money back . hopefully this is n't happening to other subscribers . i 've ordered several other magazines from amazon and always received them on a timely basis .
0	first off , i usually just stick to rating critiquing movies . but , every time i see an ad on this website for this time/warner ( or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week ) rag-mag i start to see red . `` entertainment weekly '' , which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho-hum of everyday life , has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash . back in the summer of 89 , `` ew '' was released and after i read a few issues , i decided to subscribe . i was instantly hooked ( the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the saturday before it would hit regular newstands ) i liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies , music , t.v. , and video ( that was later added in the mid-90 's ) . the problem with the magazine started in the late 90 's . i started to notice that `` ew '' would cover a big movie or event that had n't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it , or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales . i also hate the damn lists that `` ew '' comes up with . the latest entitled `` the top 100 most memorable movie lines '' was a joke . these lists have always annoyed me , because i feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking . the other most important thing i noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review . case in point , a few weeks ago i picked up the latest issue in which the movie `` catwoman '' had been reviewed ( i was n't to sure if it was gleiberman or shwarzbaum that critiqued it ) . i first logged onto `` rotten tomatoes.com '' to see what percentile `` catwoman '' recieved from the nation 's critics . out of roughly 115 reviews `` catwoman '' only got 10 % of the good reviews while the rest trashed it ( a film needs , at least , to get a grade of 60 - 65 % in order to place it as a fresh or good movie ) . that makes `` catwoman '' the worst reviewed film , so far , for 2004 . yet , `` ew '' gave the film a b . what erkes me even more is that `` catwoman '' is released by `` warner bros. '' , the same company that owns the rights to the `` harry potter '' films , `` the lord of the rings '' trilogy , yes , the `` wb '' owns `` entertainment weekly '' . is `` warner bros. '' trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular lucrative magazine 's ? i 'm not the only who has seen this developement . people have written in saying that there is favoritism among `` warner '' products that are reviewed in the magazine . `` ew '' , of course , hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews , possibly in fear of being fired ( they will deny that also ) . my only question to the reviewers at `` entertainment weekly '' is , `` whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull**it ? '' or better yet , `` what 's it like to stand on a democratic podium ? ''
0	if they made a television station with nothing but commercials , it would be like this magazine . had the publisher been more forthcoming , they would have entitled it `` rv reviews '' or something of that nature . there is little in this magazine having to do with actual camping . it 's almost exclusively rv articles . i 'm not opposed to rv camping ( i rather enjoy rv'ing too ) but i was under the impression that it covered tent camping as well . it does precious little of that ! the most unacceptable portion of the magazine is the fact that it 's just pages and pages of ads for rv 's and rv-related items . i would n't even recommend this to an rv owner as there just really are n't all that many articles here . the few articles they have are pretty good , but not great . look elsewhere for a good camping magazine .
0	if you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what 's really going on in the world , read this magazine . national review is for people who sympathize with christian jihadists and white supremacists . would n't want to be in that camp if i were you . read time , mother jones , the nation , or the american prospect instead .
1	i bought this as a gift for my son-in-law . he loves it . got it for him 2 years now . easy gift buying , and he enjoys a present i bought him all year .
1	i grew up reading fangoria , when i could sneak it past my parents , that is . fangoria magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article . now you are not always going to agree with everything they say , but you can always expect them to be honest . when a horror icon is not performing up to snuff , like stephen king or john carpenter , they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws . fangoria also has the chainsaw awards , where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie , actor , ect , and you can also submit a name for horror hall of fame ( my guy has yet to win it ) . they also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people ; like the japanese and italian horrors ( wow , they can make some splatter flicks ) , and more independent films that would n't be showing at the mainstream theater . and they have pictures . all the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color ( though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s ) . this is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan , i whole heartedly recomend it
0	i used to subscribe to this when it was all natural . then overnight they went to all drugs and sleaze and childish nonsense . i tried to get a refund but was ignored . unable to cancel my subscription i simply threw it into the trash can each month before my children would see it . i hate this magazine and would not allow it in my house once it was filled with nothing but drugs and insults . thank god there are much better alternatives . actually , any magazine any where is better . if and when they switch back to all natural i may buy it again , until then no way ! !
0	i love the mag , but sister never recieved the order i gave her as a gift ! ! !
1	this publication is , in my opinion , the most intelligent , funny , and readable magazine about pc games available . it blows the competition offered up by the u.s. magazines out of the water . you get : *a dual-sided dvd loaded with demos , movies , screenshots , podcasts , games , mods , patches , and compiled archives of games and hardware recommendations to view from your pc *humor which obliterates the drivel attempted by the us version . *lots of material- it 's thick and the pages are much bigger in size . you feel like you 're getting a real magazine rather then a flimsy , cheap catalogue of advertisements . *quality- both in the writing and physically . there are loads of articles with good insight into the industry every month . they are given lots of space and feel very scholarly to read . the pages are of good quality paper and the ink is crisp and clear , and is easy to read . pick up a copy of this from a shop like barnes and nobles sometime to see what it 's like . i guarantee you 'll be impressed , especially if you 're used to the gaming fare we get served this side of the pond
1	smithsonian says it like it was , albeit short and sweet . without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications , smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship , especially if it departs from traditional concepts . their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh , without cut and paste from the time-honored sources . their article on gavrilo princip , the assassin of archduke francis ferdinand , shook me to the core . thanks smithsonian .
1	a must-have for all info junkies . from the bizarre to the informative , the diligent crew at mental_floss never ceases to dredge up something interesting . be the life of the cocktail party , be a mental_flosser
1	i absolutely love this magazine ! it is a wonderful motivation for anyone who wants to be healthy and strong . i will be 38 in a few weeks , and am considering competing in a fitness competition because of this magazine . i read it from beginning to end , and my husband even reads it . he always asks if i saw the article on this or that , which is an indication that the information presented is useful and engaging . if you are serious about your health , want to get in shape or want to take your body to the next level , this is the magazine for you
0	give me a break , people ! all spin magazine is a cheap rip-off/wanna-be of alternative press.i 've looked at like maybe ten or less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years.think i may 've saved one of those issues.sometimes , i 'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that 's been left behind.i 'll then take it home , then likely toss it out after i 've looked through it twice.avoid at all costs

1	i go to a gym where people share their magazines , and came across this gem . while it focuses on value vacation packages , the benefit that i 've gained from it is its list of 40 top vacation packages to destinations around the world . the magazine also offers an up-to-date web page describing even more places and bargains . it has really expanded my horizons about possible vacation spots . that alone is worth the reasonable cost
1	mac world has become too costly . mac addict is economical and provides all the current info i require . good reviews and pleasant forma
0	i dont enjoy this publication at all anymore , dont know if editorial leadership has change
1	i think this magazine is really good . it gives you all the latest gossip on the best stars . it even answers your questions about some of the tabloids like : are jessica nick really over ? - i think it 's pretty wholesome too . the make-up tips are great . it 's the average teen girl 's fave mag
0	if i see another picture of a blurred waterfall or creek i am going to puke ... i have not seen one truly imaginative , artistic image in this magazine . everything is run of the mill , boring , standard outdoor photography . lots of sunsets , flower fields . no different angles or perspectives , colors , nothing new . the articles are geared toward inexperienced photographers and really repetitive . i think i clipped one interesting article in a year worth of magazines..
0	[ ... ] i got a choice of a free subscription to either parents or child magazine . since i already got parents , i chose child . i will not be renewing when my free subscription is up . the magazine is boring , the articles irrelevant and there are too many kids fashion pages . if you want a magazine about parenting/kids , go with parents .
0	my biz partner and i were excited to receive our first mag from this group . we were sorely disappointed . most of the articles are not new information , but `` rehashed '' info widely available . we read it cover to cover for about 4 months , then cancelled the subscription . there are better sources out there and this is not one of them !
1	golf digest is the best magazine , covers great players , have standard lessons from top golf teachers and schools and allways very useful tips . however , it only has one thing against ... too much advertising or too many advertisers ! !
1	mother jones is what journalism should be : gutsy , honest , no-holds barred investigative reporting . regardless of your political party , this is one of the last vestages of honest reporting left available to us . everything from world news , the envirnment , american politics and current events is researched thoroughly and reported honestly . a must read for people interested in more news than is available the newspaper , or in newsweek and time . if your tired of the pathetic blather that parades as news these days , it 's time for mother jones .
1	i have many men magazine , none comes close to men 's health . some magazines are too glossy that spell `` expensive '' for what ever they wanted to promote . with men 's health , i get to everything from a to z. i always pass my old copies to my local library for their own collection
1	oprah is an inspiring role model for millions of people . i believe that her mission is well-known- to help people live their best possible lives . it 's rare to find another person who so consistently sticks to their `` mission '' and really change lives talk show after talk show , and magazine issue after magazine issue . if you want to make your life better , live more passionately and meaningfully then the oprah magazine will definitely help you out . it contains many interesting , inspiriting and balanced topics on a broad range of subjects written by excellent writers and contributors . i am glad that the magazine still contains many really readable and informative articles appropriate for every woman who wants to feel happy , empowered , informed and intelligent . i enjoy this magazine because it opens my mind to the world and celebrates life and womanhood . each issue has a theme such as love , health , home , fitness , etc . and will cause you to take a serious look at your life and see how you can further improve yourself . you will find interesting and up-to-date information about fashion , movie stars , book recommendations , delicious recipes , money , relationships and friends . my favorite section is her quotes on bookmarks . oprah winfrey is an example of a modern , smart and sensitive woman who consistently uses her talents and staff of editors to bring us the talk show and this wonderful magazine . i think that your greatest benefit will be to gradually realize and energize her main message-you should be the first priority in your life , because if you are confused , exhausted , dissatisfied , depressed then you will not be able to help anyone ! the magazine covers all of these important areas and i am pleased to recommend it . following oprah 's tradition to draw attention to books of great value i recently read and highly recommend to my male and female clients scientist ritz ' bestseller `` scientifcally guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex '' because it truly delivers great value and results . i dare say that this magazine and book will dramatically change your life for better
0	i have read bird times many times . the articles are much less complicated than the bird talk magazine articles , which are fairly simplistic as well . i recommend that you look at the cover and see if there are any articles that you want to read . this magazine usually takes me 15-20 minutes to read , and that is if there is an interesting article . fewer ads than bird talk

1	laptop magazine is an excellent resource for the mobile professional . the staff has done a great job of reviewing products relevant to those individuals attached to their laptops and related gadgets . despite the name , the magazine is not merely about laptops but also the tools and strategies for the peripatetic white-collar worker . with information on laptops , mobile phones , hotels and airlines , laptop magazine is loaded with great insights . its layout is excellent as it appears far less cluttered than other computer magazines - much like how the harvard business review differs from star magazine . yet , it is a bit light on specific computer tasks and tweaking . this may be due to the demographic of the audience , which is most likely a collection of mid-level executives and sales professionals instead of hands-on technology gurus . as such , the magazine is well worth the read as it will certainly save time with your work , travel , and technology purchases in the future . pros : excellent product information great organization and layout cons light on nuts and bolts computer technology no concise source of the laptop reviews ( i.e . like motor trend has a summary of tests with dates and results with every magazine ) .
0	i also got this disgusting subscription `` invoice '' from these jerks . i do n't care how good a magazine is , if someone has to use deceptive , threatening and totally bogus marketing practices to ensnare new subscriptions , their magazine should not be rewarded with anyone 's business . i never ordered or got a single issue of their rag . only a repeating smack in the face via mailbox claiming i am going to be `` referred to a collection agency . '' kids discover , you will never get a cent out of me . last time i checked we still live in a land where we do n't have to pay for what we never got . if you spent as much time working on a good magazine for kids as you do sending out fake bills , you would have enough subscribers you would n't have to shanghai any new ones with your fraudulent billing scam .
0	i 'm a big player of pc games , but i also love reading and thinking about my favorite hobby . for the past few years i 've been living in the uk , but when i come to the us ( and now that i live here again ) i would pick up the american version of pc gamer . i have to say , and i hope some of you take my word on this , the u.k. publication is light-years ahead of this one . the humour is grown-up ( not to mention actually funny ) and does n't drown the magazine . it 's bigger , the cover and pages are of much better quality paper and ink , the articles are neatly laid out ... added to this , the demo disc is a jam-packed dual sided dvd , with archives of patches , movies , free games , demoes , hardware guides ... . not to mention the fact that there are many highly intelligent articles every month . in case you 're still feeling sceptical : the uk version of pc gamer was the original . it came to the us after it was set up in the uk . having lavished the uk pc gamer with praise , i think you can read between the lines and figure out where the us version falls short
0	where are all of my magazine subscription first issues ? ? ? ? ? ? ? mar
1	i am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that i prepare for my family . the beauty of `` gourmet '' is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture . i also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods , and on quick methods and dishes . i have read `` gourmet '' off and on for at least 20 years . the magazine has changed somewhat during that time . the focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine . the features of the june 2006 edition are as follows : tiki time : a collection of polynesian food and drink we are family : recipes for a summer party a greece less traveled : northwestern greece travel and recipes in the section , seasonal kitchen , there is a very well done article on salads . the roasted vegetable panzanella is fantastic . in the gourmet everyday section , i always enjoy the three regular articles : quick kitchen ( 30 minutes meals ) , five ingredients , and 10 minute mains . these are always tasty and usually all quick . if you are a foodie , and/or you want to be this magazine is a nice starting point . i would suggest that you pick up a couple of issues on the newsstand to confirm that this magazine is for you before subscribing . i highly recommend this magazine for budding home chefs .
0	i had always suspected and recently found out that elle uses a different kind of ( at least ) paper for the cover of the editions it mails to us subscribers . while the elle magazines in bookstores , supermarket etc . have thick , glossy , high quality paper for their covers , the managazines i received in my mailbox has a dull and thin cover . i guess the company wanted to cut cost , because to remain competitve , they were forced to offer subscribers a deep discount . still , it 's cheating
1	these puzzles keep me sane during my all to frequent short-hop airline flights in which there is not enough time to open up the laptop
1	i thought , eh , lucky magazine , i do n't really need this anymore ... so i broke it off . ( i am a college student , so , i 'm a little bit poor . lol . ) i was wrong . i love lucky . i know fashion and trends are kind of an `` air head '' market , but i 'm going to subscribe again because : a . ) i am a design student , and fashion and trends are chock full of design elements b . ) i subscribe to newsweek and i watch the news all the time . it is depressing , lucky is not . c. ) after coming home from a long day of classes and work , it 's not so bad to want to read something with lots of pretty pictures , is it ? ( the answer is no , that is not bad . ) lucky rocks . seriously . if you want something that 's fun to read and fun to look at it 's great . i do n't recommend it for people who are in deep credit card debt becasue they just had to have the latest designer handbag , becuase this will get you into trouble . for everyone else , who just wants to look hip ... or just plain sytled . lucky is a great magazine
0	what is the national enquirer , you ask ? it 's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time . avoid it like the plague
0	more and more , all the industry wants to do is tell you what it is you are supposed to like , and ridicule anything we might consider to be a guilty pleasure , and if you indulge in such a thing , you are 'shallow ' . music has evolved past this attitude , and no one believes in this naked emperor anymore . and oh yeah , their politics is so mixed up , they do n't even know what they believe anymore . i was a subscriber for eleven years , my renewal notice came , and i could n't come up with one good reason to send it in
0	first off , i subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years , and enjoyed it . but the `` main guy '' robert kennedy , is someone who offends me both personally and politically . he assumes that every girl/women reading that magazine is tiny . for his information , some of us work out 5-6 days a week and eat well , and are still heavy-set . his comments on heavy-set people are offensive , thoughtless , and sometimes even downright cruel . nonetheless , the pictures/articles were inspiring to me , and it is a decent fitness magazine
0	i have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and i have become very skeptical of much of its advice . this advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g . the us dairy industry ( there is always at least one of those annoying `` got milk '' ads ) and not surprisingly , every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products ( e.g . milk and cheese ) . however having read many books on nutrition , it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the the china study by colin campbell , an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the us dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public 's perception of the healthfulness of its products . it is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers ' paychecks . the magazine also appears to be very similar to prevention magazine which i also have subscribed to and i would make the same criticism of . my advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent `` berkeley wellness letter '' that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the us dairy industry
0	i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year . the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i could n't have been more disgusted at the vapid , innocuous , 'insights ' it offered . this magazine has no redeeming social value .
1	ladies home journal has several features that readers will like . one of the most popular is `` can this marriage be saved '' featuring a couple that is having marital problems presenting both their sides and then a counselor 's advise . other columns include `` how they met '' , `` animal affairs '' , and `` raising a family '' . each month there is an article featuring a family that acquired a house through habitat . a nice feature is a column presenting a man 's perspective called `` heart of a husband '' . there are also articles on beauty , health , travel , and parenting . there are plenty of recipes and craft and decorating ideas . each issue also includes a couple of celebrity interviews . i highly recommend subscribing to ladies home journal , you wo n't be disappointed !
0	if you are into high brow interior design then this is for you . but my problem is not so much with the magazine as it is about their customer service at veranda and the subscription department 's ability to read . they are by far the worst
0	it seemed like there were 2 articles 80 pages of advertisements
0	i am completely frustrated and upset with the delivery , or lack thereof , of the magazine subscription i received as a gift of romantic homes . this is my absolute favorite magazine and my husband purchased a year 's subcription for me from amazon.com for christmas 2005 ! i still have n't received one magazine ( it 's now july 2006 ) . amazon assured me three times , over the past year , it was coming , it 's now july and i still have n't received the magazine . i am so disappointed at the lack of customer service . i urge you to never buy a magazine subscription from amazon.com . this has been a horrible experience and i can not believe that it has somehow become okay to run a business in this matter . i am tired of empty promises from amazon.com while i am anxiously awaiting my magazine . not only have i not received my magazine , the `` people '' at amazon have never offered a refund , a renewed subscription , anything ! i realize it 's a measly twenty-something dollars , but this business practice is horrible ! i am also tired of speaking to people that do not speak english and are trying to help me . please do better amazon , this is terrible ! shame on you !
1	this magazine is sweet it features tons of eye candy , being plants and hot girls and buds , lots of great tips , tricks and info on the culture around pot
1	i wish this magazine came out more often ( as another reviewer said ) . it would be fascinating for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of technology and engineering . recent articles have covered vacuum tubes , their history , and why some are still used now , and nuclear power and how that industry stalled in america . i remember reading another article in the mid-'90s about a guy in new york city who shoveled coal for a public school furnace . he explained his job and how hard it was to buy a coal shovel ( the hardware store people could n't believe it ) . a few years later they followed up with a note that all public schools in nyc had been converted from coal , and that the coal-shoveler 's job was much easier maintaining the new furnace . stories on iron bridges and how necco wafers are made ( with the same machine for 100 years or so ) and how buttons are made from seashells and how paper clips are made and how a hollywood actress designed a frequency-jumping weapons guidance system and all sorts of others are included . lots of cool articles about how everyday ( and not-so-common ) technologies went from ideas in someone 's mind to products that are ready for use
0	i remember , not quite four years ago , when this magazine actually had pc substance and catered to a sophisticated pc-oriented market . now , it 's thin , hollow , interminably off-topic and ad-choked .
1	this is an excellent magazine but i would have saved $ 7.00 on an annual subscription by buying it with the enclosed postcard rather than through amazon . also i have to wait 12 weeks to receive the first issue ! ! my bad
1	in my humble opinion , this is the best magazine for style and fashion advice . even the advertisements are hip and informative , in terms of fashion and style . of all the style magazines out there today , this is far and away the best of the best .
1	playboy magazine , while luring people to open the cover with promises of female flesh , consistently has excellent articles focusing on issues of civil rights , civil liberties , and the defense of them all . trancending partisanship , playboy is a beacon of stewardship over the rights we all take for granted daily . and the pictures are nice
0	ordered 11/27 - never received a single copy . not very fast is it ? slow company may be a better description . can i have my money back
1	great magazine ... .my favorite ! ! ! ! if you dont like the price here , go to uncuts home site and subscribe at about $ 7 per issue
1	fangoria has always been the first rate magazine for horror movie freaks . nothing else comes close : if you 're in love with horror movies look no further-this mag has been out for over twenty years
0	this is a great magazine , but do n't order it through amazon . they go through a third party ( snapse magazine ) that has terrible customer service . i ordered this magazine in january and six months later ... still no magazine . i called snapse twice and was told they had no record of the order ( even though i received an email confirmation from amazon and i have a 17 digit confirmation number ) . they said they would research it and get back to me . no one called or emailed me the status , so two weeks later i called them again . they acted as if i had just placed the order and told me it takes 6 to 8 weeks to receive the first issue . i wo n't get my first issue until august . buyer beware ... it could take seven months before you receive your first issue .
1	from fitting pants to making origami pants , there is always something for the sewer to learn and enjoy . threads used to have good knitting articles , but decided to abandon the subject to concentrate on sewing . if you are a fashion sewer , this is a must-have
1	a real favorite in this magazine is the page of quotes , it is sure to bring a smile or teach you something about life . they also always have cleaning tips , health topics , diet and exercise solutions , true stories , beauty hints , inspirational articles , soul nourishing tips , recipes , recipes and more recipes , family/children , flowers , end of the magazine article to make you think about life , and gardening hints . if you want to find a cover story fast , they have an `` on our cover '' section in the index . in every issue there is a shopper 's guide and a recipe index . the articles are helpful and in the march 2002 issue they had an article on how to be less stressed . they also had an article on pcos which is apparently more common than we women think . the beauty sections show you the newest fashion and you can decide if you want to adapt your style to the trends . always seems rather chic . some of the recipes in the march 2002 issue included : a luscious lemon coconut pound cake coconut macaroons peanut butter oat bars baby cheesecakes - really cute banana salsa french oven beef stew pasta with shrimp the recipes are not difficult and seem practical . even the advertising in this magazine is colorful and fun . a very `` american gal '' type magazine . nothing fancy , just real life . ~therebeccareview.com
1	i have more animals than i know , i love best my gang of dogs , and this mag . has it all products , reviews , vet info , wonderful storie
0	i read this at stop and shop each month , hoping it 'll get better . each month i hope desperately for some pertinent , relevant , or just plain mildly useful business hints and tips ... and they are just not forthcoming . for someone who is interested in making millions with vending machines , look no further . always longed to invest in one of those mlm ( multi-level marketing ) ventures that start their pleas with : `` dear friend , i was once a loser like you . thanks to this company , i 've turned my life around ! what are you waiting for ? just send me all your money and you could be as tanned and successful as i am . '' ? then this is your mag ! for a business owner who is looking for some serious help ? do n't bother ! you 'd be far better off with a subscription to american venture or something in that line
1	great magazine . published out of the uk . excellent features and great bits of trivia . my favorite sections are cash for questions ( readers send artists questions and win cash ) -someone asked lou reed if he really performed heroin for a conference of psychiatrists and won 25 pounds , now ( new artists ) , instant karma `` where pop and philosophy meet '' . also great music reviews , more than 200 in each issue of a wide variety of music genres . but what they do really well are lists -top 100 albums ever , the 90 best albums of the 90 's etc ... my favorite being `` when rock stars go crazy - the 100 greatest acts of rock'n'roll folly '' - no.1 being michael jackson statue sails down the thames ( river in london
0	this magazine is all puff -- if you 're looking for honest and insightful reviews , this is not your read . however , if you already know all the artists they profile and just like pretty pictures of them , this magazine is worth buying for the sampler disc included with every issue
0	during the 1960 's , when my sister subscribed to ahmm , the stories mirrored the fantastic television show ; the stories were primarily mysterious , creepy , and unique , with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great . now , the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain , uninteresting `` detective '' stories . i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's , but stopped because of the same old boring `` cops and robbers '' material . i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop , but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed . subscribe only if you are a fan of pure `` police '' fiction
0	if you 're in search of a magazine for women that actually has worthwhile content then move on . there is nothing of substance in cosmopolitan . open the latest issue and you will find `` sex tips that will drive your man crazy ! ! ! '' and `` snag that cutie ! ! '' galore . it 's pathetic . and sophomoric . the sad thing is young women purchase magazines like this and want to emulate the fake lifestyles within that revolve around a ) looking for your `` one true love '' and by default b ) how to achieve multiple orgasms with random sexual partners/boyfriends whilst on said search ! and let 's not forget inane question and answer spreads . those are a hoot with such inquires as `` my crack gets really itchy . what should i do ? '' no , this magazine is not my bible . this is another publication that deserves to be thrown into a furnace
1	even if this magazine is a mag-a-log , what would we do without it ? september issue rocks with eva mendes on the cover and some juicy fall finds inside . the biggest news ? lucky has found a way to shop with your cell while stuck in traffic . it 's about time technology got up with our lifestyle

1	house and garden is a no-holds barred celebration of great *design* , primarily of interiors -- and to a lesser extent `` gardens '' and exteriors -- but also of product and architecture , with a smattering of coverage dedicated to artistans , travel , wine , and music . there is a spirit of high playfulness and arch but subtle , airy sensuality pervading h ... seems to me it 's published by artistic souls for artistic souls ... if you want pedantic , safe , predictable , go for traditional home , house beautiful , even martha stewart 's living or one of the other , more mainstream magazines . while it 's true that not all of the issues are standouts -- the issues published around the end-of year holidays are generally thin and somewhat wan compared to the spring and fall issues , when staff are doubtless away on vacations and content must undoubtedy suffer -- overall house garden hits it out of the park more often than not . like domino , it 's newer , younger cousin in the field of `` shelter magazines '' , it breathes the fresh air up there -- up above the cluttered field of clone publications which all proscribe the same cookie cutter `` look '' for homes -- and succeeds beautifully . h is a real little monthly armchair primer on what 's new and noteworthy in the field of residential design and related topics ... blissfully free of tiresome , ubiquitous celebrity coverage ( the recent cover article on jade jagger notwithstanding ) . even the font -- a clean , stylish art deco -- nods towards the knowing . highly recommended !
0	my subscription was for a year . but the subscription office stopped sending the magazines even before the subscription expired . i would suggest people subscribe to good housekeeping directly instead
0	i do not who to contact on this problem but i have as of yet to recieve a magazine yet . i kow it is to take awhile but i have recieved other order of a different magazine i placed
1	nice replacement for my oprah magazine . like the concise and to the point articles . good suggestions sprinkled in magazine . very heavy with the advertisements ... but then the ads rip out quickly , leaving a more simple real simple read .
0	anyone with a good taste in music will hate this magazine , as it only rates bad bands from bad genres good reviews and whatever good bands are listed , are often given bad reviews . its all pretentious pop-culture drivel for the conformist , weak-willed mainstream american . the worst part of rolling stone is the 100 greatest guitarists of all time list ; as they highly rate kirk hammett , kurt cobain , and tom morello ( all extremely overrated guitarists ) while rating eddie van halen at a very lowly # 70 and not even mentioning these awesome guitarists ; kerry king/jeff hanneman ( slayer ) , john petrucci ( dream theater ) , trey azagthoth/erik rutan ( morbid angel ) , jeff loomis ( nevermore ) , steve vai , and joe satriani . if you know anything about good guitarists , those eight guitarists i just mentioned destroy kirk , kurt , and tom . do n't read this if you 're trying to decide what good music is , you decide what good music is . think for yourself , do n't let mtv and rolling stone think for you
1	i subscribe to inc.. although i am not a business owner , yet , i find the articles to be informative and the magazine a useful resource . as an accomplished song writer and aspiring song seller , the article on ( ... ) -may 2005- made me aware of a resource that i did know was available . check that one out . with joe mansueto , ceo of morningstar and self-confessed fan of inc. , acquiring the magazine i can only imagine the great things ahead . the full-page n.y. times ad reinforces mansueto 's commitment to growing the brand . ca n't wait for future issues
0	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get . i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies . instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors . if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler ... this is not the mag for you .
0	this magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature , stupid , and boring . the magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so-called news coverage gives short details of events and people that does n't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste . do n't bother
1	i wish i could give this magazine 6 stars . finally , an honest magazine for christians . i am the target demographic , so i understand the style does not appeal to all , but the content can easily relate to anyone who is willing to get past their pre-concieved religious notions and desire biblical truth . i sometimes get sick of the 'relevant ' move because it frequently becomes used as an excuse for christians to abuse their freedom as believers , but relevant does a fantastic job of giving a balanced look at relevant faith . i do n't always agree with every article , but i appreciate the open , honest , and sometimes opposing views . it is not a one-sided , or single minded publication . i wish i could afford to get a subscription for all the christians i know
0	i flip through time every now and again at the barber shop . sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change , people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists . for the most part , since time receives most of its revenues from big business advertisements , it ca n't challenge the establishment as it needs to . so instead i read magazines like z , utne , mother jones , the progressive , the sun , earth island and the new internationalist
0	this is probably the best music/movie magazine out today . however , you can go to borders books or barnes and nobles and get it for $ 8.95 or something . this deal is bs
0	an anti-catholic newspaper in a catholic town ( this peculiar quality of the paper existed long before the priest-child sex abuse scandal in the area ) . whether you are a catholic or not the paper 's anti-catholic bias makes one wonder why it has such an ax to grind and wonder too if the paper does not hold other prejudices . its `` factual reporting '' often times reads more like editorials . it has elitist pretensions without the quality to back them up . i live in the boston area and am exasperated with the globe . i prefer reading the new york times
0	i bought the magazin on november , and i do n't recive it yet
0	i 've been a loyal subscriber since 1998 and have always enjoyed the magazine . something happened to them in early 2006 - they 've either been bought or have hired a new editor / staff or something . this magazine is absolutely terrible now . all ads , fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue , and the hilarious articles are now long gone . my last two issues ( sept and oct ) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox . i 'm canceling my subscription .
0	many of us who have contibuted years of creative expertise to our field feel quite insulted by publications of this sort that attempt to `` take a ride '' on the creativity of others . my advice : do not purchase , read , or advertise in this third-rate publication . there is little more credibility or validity than watching `` jerry springer '' . please , do not embarass yourself or your clients ! save this one for the bottom of the cat box only
0	where 's the content in this magazine . ads ... ads ... ads . they try and make themselves out to be a great golf travel magazine , but i have seen much better in other publications . i agree with the woman from england ... links loads up on these inserts . i like to read a magazine like the golfer , where they travel all over the world and review spectacular courses from the carribbean to new zealand
0	i looked at intermezzo in a bookstore , and my husband purchased a subscription for us because it looked like a great cooking magazine . beware , beware , beware ! i received a total of 2 magazines and repeated promises that others were on the way . r. tully is great about responding to emails . it 's a shame the magazine does n't show up as promptly , if at all . i recommend cooking light . it is a fantastic magazine with lovely recipes and incredible customer service . they replace missing issues and do everything in their power to make the customer happy
0	it has been several weeks and still no magazine from money ! ! ! ! oh yeah but they did remember to bill my credit card in a timely fashion ... .maybe when something takes over a month you should bill the person when u ship the product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i have been a subscriber for a few years and have found alot of the articles repetitive and not all that educational . recently i have subscribed to shutterbug which is a much better magazine for both the novice and professional photographer . its articles are insightful and even after many years they still can teach this old photographer a few new tricks ! ! ! !
0	so i ordered the magazine in nov. 6 , 2005 . its now feb. 22nd , 2006 and the magazines ( since i also ordered the smithsonian and scientific american ) are nowhere to be seen . of course , my account was quickly charged and at this pace , i 'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before i receive any of them ... so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine , it might be a better idea to get somewhere else..
0	i should preface this reveiw with the fact that i am an accomplished home cook . i have been cooking for 25 years and own more than 500 cookbooks . i do not buy commercially prepared products like breads , crackers , mayonnaise or salad dressings . i make these items myself . i suspect that i am not the target audience for this publication . the may/june 2006 issue is 32 pages in length in total . given that there are only 6 issues a year , i was expecting a little more than a mere 32 pages . the may/june 2006 issue contains the following information : simplifying moroccan chicken bringing home fish and chips grilled tomato salsa grilled london broil main-dish vegetable stir-fries how to cook pasta foolproof veal scaloppini a new twist on chicken salads garlic and olive oil mashed potatoes utimate turtle brownies best strawberry cream cake the scoop on vanilla ice cream a review of tongs if you are an experienced cook their is n't much about cooking in this issue that will be new to you . this issue contained not a single piece of new information for me about cooking . however , i enjoyed the equipment reveiws and did find them informative and useful . this magazine would be helpful if someone is an inexperienced cook . bottom line , i will not be renewing my subscription unless future issues have a little `` more meat '' in their content . i think that this magazine is overpriced for what you receive . i would suggest saving the price of the subscription and buy their `` best of '' cookbook instead . it costs about the same amount , contains many more recipes , has many of their equipment reviews and is bound in a hard cover so that it will hold up longer . additionally , check out an issue of `` fine cooking '' which is another test kitchen type of publication , just with more depth .
0	i ordered the magizine subsribtion and when i ordered they told me it would take up to 6 weeks , so i went out and bought that months issue . a few weeks later that issue came , which is understandable but they had sent me the previous month before that . i hadnt even ordered my subsription that month .
1	despite its controversial past , i 've subscribed for years and enjoy this magazine a lot . definately a lot of good articles
0	was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting , indepth coverage , etc . then , starting about 1-2 years ago , the magazine started to take a `` left '' tilt . ( i do not consider myself `` right wing '' , am registered as an independant , but do like fair balanced coverage in my news ) since the beginning of this decline , the atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine . the bias has also led , as it always does , to less in-depth reporting , since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent .
0	at one time , southern living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas . over the past few years , it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food , in a sad attempt to re-arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook . only the christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now . we can not speak to its information on gardening , just the cooking part . if it were not my mother 's habit of reading southern living , we would have cancelled this long ago . if you are a serious cook , get the cookbooks from years ago . the current magazine is well beneath you
1	a lot of reviewers share similar views , as seen in the recurrence of similar criticism of today 's magazines . what these complaints also have in common is that they can tend to be fairly uninformed in regard to certain issues . first off , we all know that t+l is for `` affluent travelers . '' read the publisher 's description , and it will tell you just that . so if you 're not an affluent traveler , then do n't waste your money on t+l and stick to budget travel . t+l occassionally has `` affordable '' stories , especially in their affordable issue in march . but do n't expect the hotels to be to be under $ 200 a night . you know why ? because nowadays under $ 200 a night means you 're a step above a youth hostal , especially in europe where you pay an extra 20 % on top of every dollar with today 's exchange rate . the point is that t+l never positioned itself as an affordable travel mag , so to criticize its shortcomings in that respect is an invalid complaint . anyone who claims the photography is blown out and out of focus has n't picked up a copy of the magazine since 1999 . furthermore , if all you saw were straightforward photographs of hotel rooms , you 'd go out of your mind with boredom . there 's nothing wrong with adding a little art to your photography , after all photography is in fact art , and t+l does a pretty good job of that . and so what if there 's a beautiful woman in the photo . no one 's saying you have to look like her or promising that she 'll be strewn across the bed in your hotel room . use your imagination - this is travel photography in travel + leisure magazine - it ai n't newsweek . and with all of the other offensive problems with media today , only in america do people complain about too much skin . lastly , readers need to understand that magazines do n't put in more ads for giggles . a magazine is a business , and ad revenue is the way a magazine earns money . so the more ads they have , the more profit they have , the more money they have to pay better photographers and writers and hire more staff and do more research , etc , etc , etc . no magazine is going to choose to throw away money in order to not offend its readers with fewer ad pages . in fact , high ad content is an indication of a high circulation , which is an indication of reader satisfaction . the more people a magazine reaches , the more companies want to advertise there . the fact of the matter is that there is no perfect travel magazine in existence . they are either too service heavy , or editorial fluff , or too scientific and adventure-y , or just a b-level publication . t+l has its shortcomings , it has its top whatever lists and there 's a lot of high-end service in there . but it 's stunning and has its share of well written and interesting articles
1	my kids love highlights ! it 's applicable to both of their age ranges ( 6 and 9 ) and is a valuable investment for any parent . i do n't know what i would do without this magazine ; it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car . not to mention , it 's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months .
1	a playground for the mind . covers a wide range of subjects . each review is a full essay on the subject of the book . many reviews compare and contrast several recently published books on the same subject . learned and sophisticated yet fully accessible . an on-going liberal arts education and the easiest way i know to keep the eclectic learning that a liberal arts education aspires to
1	i have had the subscription for 2.5 years now and i enjoy getting it bimonthly . the recipes often do call for hard to find ingrediants ( since i do n't live in a real big city ) and most of them take alot of prep time and cooking but that 's why the magazine is cooking pleasures . it 's not quick 'n easy . i gave the magazine 4 stars instead of 5 because i find that most of the recipes are `` pleasurable '' in comfort and not calories or fat . i love the desserts and main dishes they usually have , its just that most of the dishes are not good for the waist line . but , i guess that 's why its pleasures and not light
0	truly this is the magazine of the warmongers , the neocons , who would gladly repopulate america completely with non-europeans , except for the neocons themselves and their cohorts , who are of `` a race of the mind , '' as one wag put it , by and large . pro-war and anti-american people ( and certainly anti- euro-american people ) , this magazine is truly one to be boycotted . if you are an american of european descent the american conservative will more likely be for you . if you are racially aware and do n't wish to see your people vanish from the earth , i would also recommend the occidental quarterly . to give the devil his due , tws does carry some interesting book reviews at times . if you love your people , as long as they are not from `` the race of the mind , '' do not buy this magazine , and if you already subscribe do the smart thing and cancel for a refund , as i did a few days ago . highly recommended as antidotes to this warmongering propaganda are two outstanding collections , neo-conned ! and neo-conned again
1	the high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the united kingdom . a subscription over there runs about twenty bucks . however , even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside , icreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials . top-notch magazine and highly recommended . just wish imagine publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this , as-well-as a few other of their excellent magazines , here in the states
1	i just received my first order , and i love it ! this magazine covers a broad range of topics and includes designer techniques , current trends , period styles and so much more . it has tons of vibrant pictures to illustrate the articles . i think this magazine would be ideal for someone just starting out in design to gain a basic understanding on a wide range of topics , and also for the experienced designer to keep up with current trends and fill in the gaps with knowledgeable tidbits
0	i read this at stop and shop each month , hoping it 'll get better . each month i hope desperately for some pertinent , relevant , or just plain mildly useful business hints and tips ... and they are just not forthcoming . for someone who is interested in making millions with vending machines , look no further . always longed to invest in one of those mlm ( multi-level marketing ) ventures that start their pleas with : `` dear friend , i was once a loser like you . thanks to this company , i 've turned my life around ! what are you waiting for ? just send me all your money and you could be as tanned and successful as i am . '' ? then this is your mag ! for a business owner who is looking for some serious help ? do n't bother ! you 'd be far better off with a subscription to american venture or something in that line
1	outdoor photographer is the essential how-to and where-to magazine for the outdoor photographer . i would recommend it for all levels of photographic skill , although most discussions of technique are suited to intermediate to advanced skill levels . there is only occasional discussion of the most basic techniques , as would benefit beginners . there are , however , so many great ideas on where and what to photograph that i think beginners can get a lot out of the magazine as well . and you wo n't be a beginner for long . the `` outdoor '' in the title does not refer exclusively to nature photography . most of the magazine is dedicated to nature photography , but there are frequent articles on travel , location , and other sorts of outdoor photography , as well . in outdoor photographer you will find how-to articles on lighting , exposure , filters , gear , preparing yourself and your gear for the elements -be they arctic cold or rain forest heat and humidity , along with some advice specifically for digital cameras and the digital darkroom . and you will find this information for everything from close-up to landscape photography . outdoor photographer focuses primarily on 35 mm and digital photography , with an occasional article on medium format . the discussions of exposure , lighting and locations are applicable to all formats of photography , however . and there is george lepp 's monthly question and answer column for those questions on just about any photographic or digital imaging subject that are not answered elsewhere . and now for the best part . outdoor photographer tells you where to get great outdoor photographs . `` favorite places '' is a one-page feature in every issue that tells you about a great place in the united states to photograph , what there is to see , and what time of the year is best . be sure to save those in case you ever have the time and means to visit them all . in addition to `` favorite places '' there are featured articles in every issue that detail a place to photograph , how to get there , what to take , what to photograph , etc. , frequently written by well-known nature photographers and accompanied by some of their terrific photographs . i counted 3 such articles in the last issue of op that i received . if you are a photographer or hobbiest who is able to travel a lot , outdoor photographer is a terrific bargain just for the locations . and if you do n't travel much , it will help you photograph your backyard and local parks and gardens well
0	they may have some good info , but i was flipping through this in my local bookstore , and most of what they have is a whole lotta ads ... and within the ads a lot of scams and mlm schemes . buyer beware . :
1	i am a new subscriber , have received two issues so far . this is a fascinating magazine , beautifully laid out , and well written . in the first issue i received ( which i have now read almost cover-to-cover , something i never do with magazines ) , there were articles about dog rescue in asia , the science of the historical relationship between dogs and their humans , emotional vignettes about the love between dogs and humans and so much more . i like the reviewer who likened this magazine to the new yorker about dogs . the first issue was chock-full of everything from useful tips to weepy stories to fascinating science . i made an effort to cancel all of my magazine subscriptions recently , simply because i do not have the time to read them all . this one will remain . in fact , i may start archiving this magazine-it is that good ! all of our guests inevitable pick up the magazine , drawn by the crisp graphics , and retained by a healthy variety of reading . obviously , i am a fan . i have barely started the second issue , but from skimming the articles , i have full faith that i will not be disappointed . subscribe and enjoy
0	i have n't received this product yet and i 'm pretty upset about it . i 've requested that someone contact me about this problem and i have n't been given an answer . i think i 'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer . where is the product i bought ? ? ?
1	bought this as a girft for my mother , and she loves reading them . must be really good
1	yes , ew has changed over the years , but i believe it 's as relevent now as it 's ever been . the articles are interesting and the reviews usually right on the mark . i read it cover to cover .
1	if you really love sports , there is no finer magazine than si . the breadth and depth of the coverage is unequalled by any other mag . the pics are the best on earth . the writing is tops . sign me up for another 24 months
0	time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage , and recent years have only accelerated this trend . in the 60s and 70s , it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend ( originally it was considered quite conservative ) , but as the years go by it 's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance . as for its being part of the `` liberal '' media , this is inaccurate . recent coverage of the ( 2004 ) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non-person . the first debate between john kerry and george w. bush was not even covered , except for one very brief article listing a few `` fact check '' points . instead , the cover story wa about new products and movies , a kind of sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan . it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u.s. election , but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine 's ignoring a signficant world event that george w. bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office . in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment . the bias seems to be in favor of mr. bush , but it 's still mostly bland and superficial . your money is better spent on the british magazine `` the economist '' which is far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint is conservative , it 's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u.s. politics . `` the economist '' also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i 've found to a ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach to the news . time can still be entertaining to read , but i would n't take what they say too seriously . they tend to bend with the political wind
1	one of the funniest magazines around . in a recent article , the weekly standard proposed massively expanding the irs to help pay for the massive debt and budget deficit . which group did the `` weekly standard '' say should be targeted for this increased irs presence ( and massive increase in tax rate - for some 100 % ) ? the entertainment industry . the reality tv show contestants , the teen-pop singers and the like . the article noted that normally massive taxation would hurt an industry , but with all the people that really want fame , that go all out to get their 15 minutes of fame , the industry would continue along ( i 'm curious if o'rourke realizes that the tax would be applied to similar writers ) . another o'rourke article provided the readers with an alternate inaugural address by bush ( subtitle : `` what if george w. bush were n't a compassionate conservative . . . `` ; quote : `` the media say that i won the election on the strength of moral values . if the other fellow had become president , would the media have said that he won the election on the strength of immoral values ? '' ) . in all seriousness , this magazine is a very clear detailed neo-conservative look at the issues ( neo-con ? - interestingly , it would appear that many of the writers used to be liberals ) . the magazine does not always present just the conservative perspective , and does not always agree with bush . another recent article was by a current liberal , ex-communist british writer and his reaction to george galloway 's testimony before the us senate . an editorial in that recent issue was all about the dictator in uzbekistan , an us ally in the war on terror . the editorial notes that toleration of this dictator and his brutality will undermine bush 's current foreign policy . it should be noted that the magazine does not seem to have journalists , and few staff writers , most appear to be called `` contributing editors . '' it is jarring , though , when i read the magazine then read articles in some of my other subscriptions . `` variety '' and `` weekly standard '' rarely agree . for that matter , i 'm somewhat surprised by how often the `` weekly standard '' and `` business week '' disagree . - michael s. briggs -
1	he was very happy with the product and i was happy as to how fast he has received his product .
0	the title speaks for itself . i do n't know how or why i was drawn to this magazine when i was 14 . this magazine should be called j-4tweens . ah . the title is very annoying . like twist , i only get this magazine when i 'm really really desperate for something to read . i sure as hell would n't want my 12 year old daughter to wear mascara . if you have a tween and you want her to grow to become a pimpstress , get this . the only entertaining aspect of this magazine is the embarassing moments kinds of things ( but of course ) . other than that , no . they feature pretty bland fashion . all in all , this magazine is just like twist . therefore , the age reccomendation is just 11 12 , but you 're better off getting gl for even more years worth of goodness ( 10-15 yrs . ) because no , it 's not cool to steal your sister 's damn boyfriend for pete 's sake
1	this magazine covers every aspect of horror/suspense culture , such as comics , books , music and of course , movies . the writers of the articles have respect for the craft involved in the subject , and do n't just dwell on blood and gore ( but have no fear , there is plenty of that ) . whoever designs the layout of this magazine does a beautiful job . lots of glossy photos and intriguing artwork , too . give this one a try . i 'll bet you 'll love it as much as i do
0	the magazine is great ! the problem is , i am not receiving them . i ordered a subscription in january and have received 3 issues only ! ! ! all my other orders with amazon have been received , i have no idea what is happening with my magazine subscription . i wrote to amazon to ask if there was a way of tracking my order but have n't gotten a response
1	this is the one only cooking/food magazine to buy . not only does it share fabulous recipes that are tested in the magazine 's test kitchens , it also illustrates step-by-step instruction , rates cooking tools gadgets , educates the reader on seasonal ingredients
0	i subscribed to cooks magazine some years ago , back when it began publishing again . i had problems with issues that failed to arrive , and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern . since that time , i occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest . even by dint of casual glance , i 've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the `` perfect recipe '' for something or other . i now skip right to the `` perfected '' recipe , and decide whether its worth committing to memory . some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best . there are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me : 1 . product reviews : they range from just plain wrong to idiotic . the kitchenaid pro 600 was hailed by cook 's as the best in its class for many mixing chores . yet , the amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart , allowing the metal gears to separate . christopher kimball ( the editor ) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight . no , i 'm not joking . in that evaluation , le creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy . all-clad , even though it conducts heat very evenly , suffered for not having as much heft , and therefore was judged pricey , on a pound weight basis . one issue of cooks boasted on its cover `` unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others '' . apparently , hershey 's was designated best . not too many months later , callebaut was recommended above all others , and hershey 's was judged barely acceptable . feeling manipulated yet ? 2 . finally , there are those dreadful editorials by mr. kimball . rambling , painfully written , and punctuated with a picture of mr. kimball wearing a bow tie , and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it . mr. kimball is a humble man , with much to be humble about . he writes as if he were chanelling helen gurley brown , but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play . time to re-vamp this magazine , folks
1	years ago 'the sporting news ' was the fans ' 'bible ' . i can remember what a special feeling it gave to look at it , the real lowdown , the most bottom- line stuff , more statistics than even the greatest baseball nut could ever remember . i no longer really follow the game , or any of the games as i once did . and most of the figures even the names of the players are strange to me now . i picture in my mind my uncle the late broadway abe freedman who lived his life to see the yankees lose , picking up this paper and cursing at some columnist proclaiming the yankees the favorites to take it all in the coming year . that coming year and so many coming years are already gone . but there will be a next year , a next season , another sporting news ' and someone somewhere in america devouring those numbers as if they were crackers jack and cold beer at the seventh- inning stretch .
1	i am really liking this magazine already because it focuses particularly on multicultural and biracial marriages , brides , grooms , weddings , everything ! this mag focuses on brides of every color and overall just average brides in general . there is focus on how to incorporate dierent heritages into the details of the wedding from the gown to the reception . i also really enjoyed the little feature on biracial celebrity pairs and of course the gorgeous ring and gown spreads ! i definitely recommend this magazine if you are in a biracial relationship , blending two cultures into one wedding ( or both ! ) , or maybe you just want tips or ideas so you can plan a unique around the world cross cultural wedding just for fun . if an all white wedding is not for you in more ways than one than this is the magazine to pick up
0	this is one of the worse magazines i have picked up in years . if you have `` money to burn '' traveling , then it might be for you . loaded with advertising and little 'true ' content
1	this is one of my favorite magazines ! it has a little bit of everything , and i love the do 's and do n't 's section too . its aimed for 20 and 30 something women . i ca n't miss a month of it
0	i ordered this mag back in june , now it 's december and i 've yet to receive it . this equals a big fat zero in my book .
1	i 've subscribed to opm for four years now , and in that time i 've never had any subscription or delivery problems . the writing staff is very intimate with their readers ; it 's almost like reading a magazine that a bunch of your friends wrote up . the reviews have mostly been spot-on for my tastes ( compared to the awful , laughable insanity of psm ) , and even though the ziff-davis crew members are `` official , '' they are fair . also , and this is very , very important to me , their use of the english language does not suck like it does in psm . the staff at psm seem to be drunk most of the time , or maybe they just did n't make it through the second grade , i 'm not sure - but their mishandling of prose is the main reason i dropped that subscription like a hot potato . opm on the other hand seems to be written by college grads at least , and i appreciate that . easy to read , filled with thoughtful insight , fair reviews , and a heaping helping of socially balanced humor , opm is bar-none the best playstation magazine you can buy
0	i wanted more recipes and this magazine has too much other junk in it . will not renew , not what i wanted
1	i love eating well ! i am an active weight watchers member and was so disapointed in the weight watchers magazine , then i saw eating well and subscribed immediately ! it is the best food magazine out there and no ads
1	i know it takes eight weeks and maybe longer but i do appreciate the information that i 've gained from store bought `` maximum pc '' magazines . i do n't build computers but when i do order one , it is nice to be familier with the workings and attributes of the new computer . yes ... you can find much information on-line and generally faster than the amount of time it takes for the magazine to reach your mailbox , however , is great to kick back away from the computer in your favorite chair and 'read ' about it : ) a very good magazine ... but 'adult ' language used at times does not appear to me as professional use of the english language . thus the 4 rather than five stars
0	! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! dont buy ! ! ! ! nuff sai
0	this mag is for people who think they are computer experts because they can change out a video card or follow directions on changing an os setting . shallow coverage , and some of the lamest humor you will ever come across . it is nothing more then a rehash of what is freely and easily available on the internet . there is nothing original in this mag , ever . also it tends to copy and paste much of the issue from 12 months earlier . all the main articles are nearly the same every 12 months . do n't believe me ? take two magazines that are 12 months apart and compare them . the reviews are also weak . nearly every month you will see : the fastest system we ever tested ! ! ! ! ! yaaaaawwwwwwnnnnn . who cares ? anyone who knows even the slightest about computers knows that speed is not the most important attribute , even for gamers . besides , does it really matter that system y is .00005 % faster on their poor testing system then computer z ? the second star is for mr halfhills column . it is the only part that is consistantly interesting and the only person there with real technical know-how . read toms hardware and whatever tech news you want , learn how to use search engines , and skip this pointless mag
1	i love this magazine ! i love how the main message is `` be yourself ! '' it has no advertizments and it does n't say you have to be beautiful to be happy . i 'm really tom-boy , and alot of other magazines make you feel like `` normal '' girls are obsessed with iming , fashion , makeup , and boys ! i hate those magazines ! read `` a total sucker ! ! ! ! '' another review of this magazine , it says that `` normal '' teenage girls , have crushes , and hate to be out of style ! am i like that ? no way ! this magazine is just right , it has probably 1 true artical about that stuff , but it 's not really flirty or something ! get this magazine !
1	i subscribed to this magazine for useful tips i could use for my own children . not only did i find that helpful , i have also used the information to apply to my high school classes . thank you for the wonderful ideas
1	q magazine is a brilliant magazine laden with british humor , bonus cds , special edition magazines , and more . being a fan , i bought the led zeppelin special edition issue , and it was more complete than any novel ! it was about 150 pages and contained full-color pictures , info on each album , concert , experience , myth , book , review and bootleg imaginable . when critiqueing an album , they used the opinions of others and the band members as well as their own . this magazine cares-rather than gushing , ranting , or offering biased opinions , it gives the impartial truth about bands-new and old
1	i bought this magazine as a gift subscription for my sister in law . she raved over it so much i bought it for myself and wow . it is a great magazine . we generally read it cover to cover . it is truly what it claims to be- a magazine about family fun . there is a section on rating or planning family vacations . we could do without this one section but even then it is well written and interesting . other sections include family games , outdoor games , theme parties , crafts , and more . kids cooking recipes , how other families solved problems , toy book and software reviews and even more . it is jam packed with fun things to do . many of the kids things are directed towards children who are about 8 . however , my children who are younger than 8 enjoy many of the things here and look forward to the magazine so they can find new things to try . my niece who is older than 8 still enjoys the activities in this magazine too . this is a great gift for a teacher or a person who has children .
1	what a beautiful magazine ( full color pictures on glossy paper ) , and what interesting stories behind each food . the recipes are sometimes doable , although most of the time i just like to read about the exotic ingredients in each . a must have- makes the living room look very sophisticated
0	how people can read and be fooled by the nonsense sprouted in ths rag is beyond me . all the usual suspects are found through out it 's pages . this rag represents all those things that leftists are now notorious for : polictal correctness , anti-capitalists , anti-gobalisers etc with all these -isms and ologies your in for a pain in the head . what 's more the 'ideas ' you 'll find here have been tried , tested and more importantly failed . ah well ... some people are just too easy to fool
1	had great expectations , for the expensive subscription you get some really great coverage of neat hardware hacking stuff happening out there ( and available on the web ) . the how to make stuff takes many many unnecessary pages , get the feel that they are trying to fill the pages with large photo spreads . still has a way to go before it becomes a successful combination of wired magazine , elektor electronics , and hardware hack websites . would definitely like more stuff like making an xyz mill/router instead of a feature on the mit fab lab . in spite of all the above i have renewed the pricey subscription - am still hoping ...
1	despite its name , this mag is n't just for brainy types . anybody who 's interested in knowing more quirky , fascinating things about the world around them -- presented in a highly readable , humorous style -- will find 'mental_floss ' a fun read . interested in the weird history of hackers ? ever wanted to know how to grow your own organs or wrestle an alligator ? all written by your smart , funny friend from college -- or so the mag 's super-accessible style will have you thinking . a definite recommend
0	i am a time person of the year 2003 ( shared title - actively deployed u.s. servicemembers ) . i must say that reading time magazine is like reading the platform for the democratic party . actually it is even worse than that it is like reading john dean 's diary , filled more with fantasy and personal wishes than actual reality . one of the latest from the online edition is that realists have taken over washington . give me a break . a new set of hogs have come in to take over at the troff and that is it . anyone who believes nancy pelosi and her gang of political hacks is going to help america is a fool . best thing we can hope for is that they create so much gridlock that no one can spend any money in washington . maybe then they will see that america improves on its own and politicians on both side make things awful . the sad thing is that people that read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something about the world . this publication is so biased that it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try to repeat what they have `` learned '' . if you want a truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe to the economist . it probably will not change your political affiliations but it will at least make you sound competent when you debate others . the economist is quite simply the best weekly news magazine in existence . the articles are well written by people that know what they are talking about . leaders from around the world read and contribute to the economist . this is something that time , newsweek and the rest of their ilk can not claim . i am not affiliated with any political parties and do not consider myself political . i look at things from an economic perspective and vote accordingly
1	gq , a.k.a gentlemen 's quarterly is a men 's magazine like cosmopolitan is to women . gq has a broad range of contents in it 's magazine from : in-depth articles from movie and rock stars , fashion , food and drink , technology , movies , music , etc . the magazine gives equal attention to all the contents except fashion which is more abundant throughout the magazines pages . all in all , gq is a great men 's magazine with plenty of fashion news/tips , and also delves in other men 's interests as stated above

1	stupid that for bad supply side business i havent gotten the magazine and wont get it for at least another month and yet i am asked to write a review for it . boo amazon wheres my magazine
0	do not order . they only placed an order for 7 months but i got billed for 12 . after 3 hours on the phone they said that 7 months was all the publisher had available and they cannnot extend it . after pitching a fit they offerred to give me a partial refund but can not extend the subscription . only order from the magazine itself
0	i certainly do hope one of these days that maxim magazing will get women who are small-breasted equal time . that 's all i have to say
1	in christmas of 2005 i decided i wanted the most interesting and best cooking magazines out there . but which ones to pick ? after buying one here and there i found three that i absolutely love . saveur was one . the recipes are nice though some i would n't touch with a ten foot pole ( ethnic ingredients that do n't appeal to me ) . but the stories and the pictures ... they are n't just amazing , they 're astounding ! where national geographic talks about certain things or places , saveur takes you to different places and shows you what 's there and how they eat . they showed me ireland and i even made colcannon ( a mashed potato and cabbage dish ) everyone loved it . i made a french dish last night that was amazing . it was a little time consuming but worth it ! i do have admit i was a little disappointed with my first issue i received from them with my subscription . it looked like a dog ate it then ran through the water with it . it 's readable but i was n't happy . they also promise two exclusive magazines for new subscribers . i 've never seen them . but i have been getting my magazines and they look good . i was thinking about it the other night , my three magazines i picked ... one was articles and recipes about healthy eating ( eating well ) , one was easier recipes with no articles ( everyday food ) , and then saveur . if i could only pick one to keep ... it would be saveur . it 's really that good of a read .
0	regardless of the quality of the magazine , it is really annoying to see oprah on every single cover ! and to make it worst , she does not pick `` regular oprah shots '' , instead you look at every issue 's front cover and ask yourself `` how did they take that picture ? she does n't even look like her ! '' it 's as if oprah is telling all of us `` see how i can look like ? '' every month is just a new testimony from oprah , that money does do wonders . on the top of that , oprah 's personal thoughts , things , favorites , ideas , even more pictures are all over the few pages that are not advertisement . i still gave it 2 stars because from time to time you can find a good article , but the bottom line is the question : is this a magazine or a show off ?
1	i 'd been a long-time fan to vibe since they been out . i 'member i first lay eyes on em by checking the covers on 'em but not reading by 'em . y'know . they such knockouts . yeah they definitely keepin ' it real no matter what . i believe they 'll be around more and more since them magazines u read all the time like essence , ebony and jet . i still have love for them also . but to say vibe does n't suck . i 'd never been a subscriber since last year and i definitely enjoy it to this day . i actually read the xxl and source magazine most often now . same w/ upscale , campus life , just to name others . i luv they magazine to death man , knahmsayin . ya 'll keep it rocked y'heard . nobody 's bringin ' the hype on ya fellaz . keep it up ! !
1	as with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit , it is only as good as the tools you use . this magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods . there are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions . you can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material .
1	vanity fair is a highly recommended monthly magazine for people who enjoy reading . packed with lengthy articles , gorgeous photography and blurby information , it never fails to entertain the reader . it is the perfect companion for a lazy afternoon at the beach or on quiet plane ride across country . the vanity fair forumla is simple : slap a photo of a celebrity on the cover and inside offer a wide variety of articles , including hollywood puff pieces , domenick dunne 's true crime accounts , in-depth articles about international scandals , christopher hitchens essays and profiles of colorful , unknown characters . though this formula has changed little since the magazine was revived in the 1980s by its now legendary editrix tina brown , the magazine 's new editor , canadian-born graydon carter , has succeeded in putting his own personal stamp on vanity fair . in virtually every issue carter uses his letter from the editor to bash us president bush . though i do not begrudge carter his right to speak his mind , after months of reading carter 's criticism , i get bored with these relentless rants . still i highly recommend a vanity fair subcription to anyone who enjoys reading . -- regina mcmenami
1	this is the only music magazine you ever need to read . this is what rolling stone should aspire to be . there is really nothing more to say than if you like music this is all there is
1	detailed articles , and interesting columns . balanced , and not afraid to be critical where appropriate .
0	i 'm a big player of pc games , but i also love reading and thinking about my favorite hobby . for the past few years i 've been living in the uk , but when i come to the us ( and now that i live here again ) i would pick up the american version of pc gamer . i have to say , and i hope some of you take my word on this , the u.k. publication is light-years ahead of this one . the humour is grown-up ( not to mention actually funny ) and does n't drown the magazine . it 's bigger , the cover and pages are of much better quality paper and ink , the articles are neatly laid out ... added to this , the demo disc is a jam-packed dual sided dvd , with archives of patches , movies , free games , demoes , hardware guides ... . not to mention the fact that there are many highly intelligent articles every month . in case you 're still feeling sceptical : the uk version of pc gamer was the original . it came to the us after it was set up in the uk . having lavished the uk pc gamer with praise , i think you can read between the lines and figure out where the us version falls short
0	it took four months to arrive and by then i was moving ...
1	i am a loyal , long time fan of empire magazine and have collected almost every issue from no.1 . being a british mag , it differentiates itself from others like premiere and entertainment weekly by it 's frank dissection of all movies , and provides a wide range of opinion and discussion . i will always read empire , and if you like movies , you should too .
1	i 'll let others argue whether or not the quality of the magazine has subsided over the years . i , for one , still get something out of the writing . ca n't do without my monthly dose of harper 's and the atlantic . what i would like to point out is that why would you buy here when the subscriptions cost less on a.m. 's own website
1	i am a regular u.s. reader of other future publishing art titles , and was overjoyed to see the first title on the newsstand of this fantastic magazine . imaginefx explores the digital science fiction , fantasy and anime genres through letters , interviews , portfolio expositions and fantastic tutorials . all issues also include pull-out artwork by the featured artist , as well as a companion dvd featuring files for the tutorials , artwork and software . within the magazines pages one will find a wide assortment of styles and artists , including everything from tutorials by noted conceptual artist ryan church to explorations of gothic art by several fantastic artists which all serve to expand your creativity and help you along your own creative path . on the minus side , most of us u.s. readers will be put off by the per-issue pricetag . but for those living in the u.k . ( lucky ! ) or those u.s. readers willing and able to part with the money , this magazine is not to be missed
0	forbes is a great magazine . amazon on the other hand , well they ought to get out of the magazine business . order said first issue would be in february . amazon `` forgot '' , to place the order until i called in april to find out what happened . now they claim the first issue will be june 19 . yeah right . funny how they do n't forget to charge the credit card you place the order . do n't order magazines from amazon
0	i subscribed to modern bride as a gift to my fiance . aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription , i only received about 3 issues total . months went by without anything being delivered . while customer service at modern bride was very accomodating and helpful , nothing happens immediately . when planning a wedding , each and every month is precious . especially during the initial stages of wedding planning . to have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting . plus , by this time most of the wedding details were finalized , the magazines i received became useless . if you 're under 12 months to your wedding date , you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with modern bride
1	rue morgue is a true horror magazine . you get countless articles on upcoming , recent , and past horror with interviews from writers , directors , stars , and more . there 's always tons of reviews on everything from theatrical horror to festival horror to those silly straight to video horrors . crave more horror on the 'net , then rue morgue is always giving you your fill on websites . and what i 've always found to be an awesome thing about rue morgue ... there 's always full page ads of upcoming horror movies which serve as mini-posters , and they 're glossy paged . rue morgue , you just slashed into my heart and did it right
1	great magazine . covers the full range of .net technologies . every issue is packed with windows , web , and xml development articles plus industry news and a lot more . high recomended
0	first off , i usually just stick to rating critiquing movies . but , every time i see an ad on this website for this time/warner ( or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week ) rag-mag i start to see red . `` entertainment weekly '' , which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho-hum of everyday life , has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash . back in the summer of 89 , `` ew '' was released and after i read a few issues , i decided to subscribe . i was instantly hooked ( the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the saturday before it would hit regular newstands ) i liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies , music , t.v. , and video ( that was later added in the mid-90 's ) . the problem with the magazine started in the late 90 's . i started to notice that `` ew '' would cover a big movie or event that had n't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it , or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales . i also hate the damn lists that `` ew '' comes up with . the latest entitled `` the top 100 most memorable movie lines '' was a joke . these lists have always annoyed me , because i feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking . the other most important thing i noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review . case in point , a few weeks ago i picked up the latest issue in which the movie `` catwoman '' had been reviewed ( i was n't to sure if it was gleiberman or shwarzbaum that critiqued it ) . i first logged onto `` rotten tomatoes.com '' to see what percentile `` catwoman '' recieved from the nation 's critics . out of roughly 115 reviews `` catwoman '' only got 10 % of the good reviews while the rest trashed it ( a film needs , at least , to get a grade of 60 - 65 % in order to place it as a fresh or good movie ) . that makes `` catwoman '' the worst reviewed film , so far , for 2004 . yet , `` ew '' gave the film a b . what erkes me even more is that `` catwoman '' is released by `` warner bros. '' , the same company that owns the rights to the `` harry potter '' films , `` the lord of the rings '' trilogy , yes , the `` wb '' owns `` entertainment weekly '' . is `` warner bros. '' trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular lucrative magazine 's ? i 'm not the only who has seen this developement . people have written in saying that there is favoritism among `` warner '' products that are reviewed in the magazine . `` ew '' , of course , hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews , possibly in fear of being fired ( they will deny that also ) . my only question to the reviewers at `` entertainment weekly '' is , `` whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull**it ? '' or better yet , `` what 's it like to stand on a democratic podium ? ''
0	i purchaced this magazine thinking that it would be the next step from the amateur photo magazine level to the serious pro level . in fact , it is not really either .
1	as an interior design student , i find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration , variety , and creativity . this magazine is more about art and design than advice on `` do it yourself '' decorating or cheap furniture finds , so : do not subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one-two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different , more practical purpose
0	harper 's bazaar is a pretty decent fashion magazine , but i wish now that i had never gotten a subscription . true , each issue would be more expensive , but 1 ) i could pick out what issues seemed worth buying , as some are thin and empty 2 ) they are quite often late with their delivery or you miss an issue . i have only gotten one issue on time , to be honest .
0	all you manager types . you know who you are you read 'who moved the cheese ' and jesus ceo , this is the mag for you lame , trite and oh so self importen
1	this is a great magazine with the exception of articles written by herb glossberger , who seems to only write articles about the people at la lifting club ( where he works out ) . if you overlook that aspect , the mag is great . the knowledge that can be gained simply by reading the articles written by louie simmons and dave tate . well worth it . it also can not be purchased in your local magazine store
1	logic problems really helped me prepare for college . many of my courses required critical thinking and writing . when i first started doing logic problems , i was terrible ! they were so hard , but as i practiced , i became adept at solving these problems . i thought of them as `` mental push-ups '' . the effort was worth it ! i graduated magna cum laude
0	lucky magazine makes me feel not so lucky . it makes me sad that i can not afford all the items they put in their magazine . one month they tell me round-toed shoes are in and show me 50 pictures of shoes that i would love to own of which 2 i can afford . then the following month lucky tells me round-toed shoes are out and square-toed shoes are in and show me another 50 pictures . you get the idea ? this magazine is based on trends and you will be broke if you try to keep up and feel bad if you ca n't afford all the great things it is showing . i did enjoy lucky for it 's profiles on upcoming designers , some great website links , and the one or two affordable items it does toss in each section . i also got a few ideas on how to wear clothing in new and different ways . most of the time , though , i felt sad and envious after i finished reading it . these are feelings i 'd rather not encounter . i think i would enjoy it more if it were more informative discussing the quality differences in the items they are showing , maybe testing them out in different situations to help me make the best choice in my purchases .
1	i got a subscription for my father on father 's day , and he really likes it . recommend it
1	if you want a magazine based on fashion but merged with stories and interviews of top celebrities , then w magazine is perfect for you . this large magazine is not only interesting , but beautiful . it has pages and pages of high quality , remarkable photos . not to mention tons of beautiful fashion ads . if you live for fashion , or if you simply admire it ; you will get latched onto w. celebrities such as kate moss , mary kate olsen lindsay lohan have graced the cover of this magazine . pick it up even if you 're the slighest bit interested . you wo n't be disappointed
0	for years discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science . now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless . very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science . after buying discover since it 's very inception i find it sad what has happened to this magazine . check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months
0	i cancelled my subscription to this magazine 6 months ago with a letter to the editor stating that i loved to see nude woman , but subscribed to learn from the masters about photography . i can not tell you how disappointed i was when i resubscribed after not taking the magazine for years ... it used to be a wonderful magazine chock full of insightful articles , lighting techniques , studio setup diagrams , lots of great stuff ... i subscribed to a 2 year deal through an online subscriber and asked them to quit sending it after only 6 months and to keep the money . not worth the paper it is printed on- period . apeture i hear is pretty good , and i also hear popular photography has gotten much better and now only 95 % about advertising and product reviews and at least 5 % helpful tips and tricks..
0	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports . their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing , for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be # 1 in ranking . often , the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that is n't relevant , or does n't make sense , or the review is n't consistent with the posted viehicle stats . the magazine also seems to be biased . some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful . after further reading of many issues , you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers , for example , you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically `` trash '' and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go , when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews . ultimately , its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period . its the pat robertson of auto magazines . if it were possible , i woudl n't even give this magazine 1 star .
1	i like this magazine but i like simple scrapbooks better . it seems as though they have the same featured scrapbookers layouts in there all the time ... just from what i 've observed anyway . i like the layouts , they have good ideas , great tips on tools and some good tips on digital scrapbooking
1	long time loyal cosmopolitan reader rates 5 stars i 've read cosmopolitan and helen gurley brown since the 60 's and never miss a month . along with skads of other magazines i enjoy , cosmopolitan manages to have some fun fashion , fun hip dating articles , fiction and true stories , and lots of quick reading ideas . i 've never thought of it as a `` health '' magazine as another reviewer thought of..it 's been an iconic reading for the early sex in the city set . `` sex and the single girl '' by helen gurley brown was a breakthough book in its day , letting women in the 60 's know that it 's perfectly okay to chose career and other paths in life than the one society forced on the women in that day . cosmopolitan has been the singles bible that confirms that it is okay to be single and thriving and adventurous in your life . i can see where this would irk men that want to repress women , or women that have subdued to their repression , but if that 's not you ... then keep the cosmoplitan 's coming . catch up on some great women and what they 're doing . educate yourself on women 's health issues , find out what men like ... a few tricks..check out the fashion , new make up tricks , and new products , and never stop learning . personally , i plan to read it forever . there 's something for everyone in it . and it has inspired me for decades . thank you , cosmopolitan
1	forget about shop etc ... lucky is the best shopping mag by far . i got alot of coupons for full size products an , samples inside of lucky magazine . i love me some free samples ! i am from nyc and you have to know what 's wearing and all , so this mag let me know a whole lot about fashion , makeup , hair produts , house wares etc
1	`` the wall street journal '' is one of the most-in-depth business journals available . it is an interesting blend of current events and insightful analysis of prevailing and sometimes not so apparent trends . the quality of reporting is generally balanced and professional . although every newspaper has a political orientation of one sort or the other , the wall street journal news reporting is largely free of politics , making it a good source of unbiased news and information for most people . however , its editorial section is conservative , although thankfully the editorial section is a tiny portion of the whole magazine . the journal has a lot of insightful business news that every manager at any level should find useful . the reporters cover the various topics in great detail and with knowledgeable perspective from all sides . they are not afraid to cover corporate transgression with rigour and honesty . the journal also covers various other topics such as personal finance , special reports , business profiles , interviews , commentary , market and news of note for management personnel .
0	what is it with these gossip magazines ? ? please tell me , because i truly think no one in their right mind would ever subscribe to this garbage . all it is is mindless crap that the media puts into kids minds , while not having anything important else in the magazine . unless your 10 years old , do not subscribe to this . there are better magazines out there fortunately , like seventeen and cosmogirl ! which are n't nearly as filled with garbage like this . the reason you do n't see j-14 or this magazine or any other magazine like this on the top of the magazine list is because it has no effect on people , it 's for little kids and it 's not mature . period .
0	2 months after ordering , i have year to get my first issue . i 'm sure i 'll like it ... if i ever get it
0	this is a tabloid , so most likely the stories you 're reading are not true . why would someone spend there hard earned money on a magazine that prints alot of unfounded rumors that alot times turns out to be just that , a rumor
1	i 've been playing video games since my atari 2600 ( and my lucky neighbors calicovision ) and i 'm happy to say that someone who grew up around the same time decided to start a magazine . at play they go out of their way to show games that they think are great but that are never going to get any press anywhere else . also , since the mid-1990 's i 've been into anime but have only been able to go by word of mouth or more recently by what i see on tv ( thank you anime and cartoon network ) . now i have play to read , as it has extensive , 20-30 pages of quality anime reviews . the reviewers are more than competent and may actually posses brains , unlike the reviewers in most other game magazines . they realize that their reader is not only the thirteen year old grand-theft , tony hawk player but also people like me who need humor and intelligence in my reading material . finally , the quality of printing and lamination on the pages will make you want to keep each one forever and i have reread and consulted past issues over and over . thank you play for giving me something other than bills to pull out of my mail box .
1	kiplinger 's personal finance magazine fits right in the middle between the lowest-common denominator approach of money magazine and the head-in-the-clouds attitude at worth magazine . kiplinger 's has a nicely balanced style and tone ; it never preaches , and i almost always find a tip , suggestion , or tax-saving idea that pays for my year 's subscription in every single issue . if that 's the measure of the value of a personal finance magazine , then kiplinger 's personal finance magazine deserves a five-star rating . good stuff , and a good value
1	i 'll get to the point ... if you are looking to stay abreast of what 's going on in popular music , including the indie scene , the americana world and the major elders still around , this is as far as you need to go . the quality of the writing , be it an in-depth article ( many of which are excellent ) or a short review ( you can expect about 200 per issue ) is consistently high . furthermore , i have been introduced to many great bands that do n't even show up in any domestic magazine 's radar , although -ironically- many of these bands are american . so , if you ca n't believe that best it gets is spin or , much worse , rolling stone ( how did it ever got to the low point of having jessica simpson on the cover ... yikes ! ) , you will be immensely rewarded by trying uncut . tip : you can get any single issue at b & amp ; n , borders or tower records for the same amount , that way if you do n't like it you wo n't have to mourn 100 bucks
0	i picked up an issue of this magazine last week because i wanted to take the picture of the cover girl into my hair dresser . after i got it home , i opened it up to check it out and discovered it is the most brainless magazine i have ever seen . the articles read like something from `` teen beat '' , yet it 's filled with adult material . there were about 10 articles on `` how to please your man '' and `` what guys like '' and even a `` sex workout '' . these articles did n't contain any `` real '' advice -- just unintelligent babble . for instance , did any of you know that guys do n't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex ? hmmm , crazy . anyway , i do n't see how anyone over the age of 16 could find any of this stimulating , and yet there are too many articles about one-night stands for anyone under 18 to read . but if you 're still into taking quizzes and looking at `` half-naked hunks '' who have barely hit puberty , then this magazine is perfect . i would have given this magazine 0 stars , but unfortunately it 's not an option
1	many years ago i subscribed to bird talk for my cockatiel that i had for 25 years . recently i purchased a new green cheek conure and wanted to learn more information about the caring and raising of a conure and birds in general . i started last july y subscription to bird talk and read everything . it is an excellent source of information for every current and possible new bird owner . each and very issue is a pleasure to read and i highly recommend it to everyone
0	the articles are `` good '' but the articles are wordy and doesnt get to the point . too many annoying ads . if u want something to `` read '' this isnt the magazine for yo
0	i 'm sure that this review is n't unique . spin rotates the same ten bands on its cover , not to mention the ridiculous articles written within . by the time they get done describing the 'euro-punk-indie-pop artist that just slammed them in the face on their way to the train station with their jazzed up sound ' i 've completely forgotten the point of thier article . they must have the greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they can tag onto useless music and still manage to say nothing . they sound like cyber-nerds who need to get out a little more and stop getting thier info from mtv.com . i 'm sure that i 've learned more about what thier editors do in the office on any given day than anything remotely close to music while reading spin . next time you see it on the stands , i suggest you spin in another direction
1	this is the only political magazine i will read . it is a great read if one is a conservative , but someone with liberal ideas may not care for it
1	one of my favorite magazines ! i would'nt live w/ out it ! thanx ! artchalet @ msn.co
0	i had always suspected and recently found out that elle uses a different kind of ( at least ) paper for the cover of the editions it mails to us subscribers . while the elle magazines in bookstores , supermarket etc . have thick , glossy , high quality paper for their covers , the managazines i received in my mailbox has a dull and thin cover . i guess the company wanted to cut cost , because to remain competitve , they were forced to offer subscribers a deep discount . still , it 's cheating
0	please read naomi jakobs ' review for relevant magazine below . it captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the christian 'post-modern ' kick . if you have to go out of your way to claim you 're a celebrity , then you simply are n't a celebrity ( take `` fitness celebrity '' john basedow for example ) . in the same way , if you have go out of your way to claim that the post-modern evangelical movement is relevant , then you 're claim for relevancy is simply not credible . the christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years . however pop-culturalizing evangelical christianity is n't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when sandi patty or carmen ruled the christian top 40 . does the fact that some christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable
1	internanatial artists magazine is the best magazine on the shelf bar none . i 've read many other artist magazines time and time again , but have n't found anything that compares to this jewel . it provides great illustrations as well as wonderful perspectives that are enjoyable as well as inspiring for your reading pleasure . not only does it inform , it also provides technical and creative details and images in various media for most artist needs in bold beatiful color . this is a truly a winner
0	i have n't received this product yet and i 'm pretty upset about it . i 've requested that someone contact me about this problem and i have n't been given an answer . i think i 'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer . where is the product i bought ? ? ?
0	i ordered and paid in full ( through amazon ) for a gift subscription to vogue kitting last christmas , 2005 . the recipient never received a single issue and was treated very poorly when she phoned to inquire on more than on occasion . it is a quarterly publication but no longer seems to be consistently offered on news stands in major bookstores . read the policy regarding refunds and cancellations carefully before you give them your money ! the content of the magazine may be worthwhile but their inability to deliver as promised and poor customer service earn them one star
0	lucky is one of my frequent checkout pickups . bright , fun , and not requiring any frontal lobe interference , it 's the perfect pick-me-up for the early morning commuter train . i give it five fabulous stars ! however , the actual subscription was very underhanded ! within the space of a week i was sent last month 's issue ( long gone from the stands ) , the issue just about to decirculate , and , finally , the actual current issue . so , two weeks after my order i am already 3 issues in to a 12 issue subscription , and none too happy about it . condï¿½ nast needs to be told that subscribers do not exist to let them clear out their unsold backlog
0	was very dissapponted with this magazine . they go unread and get thrown out . just waiting for our subscription to run out . it is really for older kids and of very little interest to younger kids
1	this magizine has the latest star scoop and the coolest stories sentin by reader
0	if you 've read one `` cosmo '' , you 've read them all . do yourself a favor and check out `` glamour '' and `` self '' - you 'll walk away happy , inspired , and hunting down the mailman for the next month 's issue
1	the wine spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you 're rich or that you soon could be , all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine . there 's lots of deadly serious material in this glossy , pleasing publication . but if you 're a lover of wine who is *not* rich - the category includes this reviewer - you need to learn to take it with a sense of humor . just enjoy the game . that game includes a travelogue of the world 's wine regions as well as the possibility of gaining a decent education via month-by-month reading in viticulture and wine appreciation itself . this reader is in it for the long haul - i hope to enjoy good wine at an affordable cost for the duration of this earthly slog - and the wine spectator is my companion along the way . my job takes me out for many dinners in various parts of the world that include wine-splendored places like france , south africa , chile , argentina , australia , new zealand and - of course - northern california . but with wineries now in 49 of the usa 's fifty states , what 's *not* a wine region these days ? on those business treks , i find myself out for dinner as often as not . it 's personally satisfying to know just enough to order a pinotage in capetown , since only south africa produces this varietal , or to opt for one of argentina 's persuasive malbecs because they 're just *that* good . we 're not talking wine snobbery here , just satisfaction at the margins of life 's all too margin-less journeys . if this sounds like your game , the wine spectator may be a worthwhile investment . even if not , consider splitting a subscription with a colleague . that 's what i do . at half the price , i get a fine magazine and avoid burdening my bookshelves with one more heavy , beautiful , pleasant magazine . life can deal you worse
1	too often in america we are fed news by deceiving journalists ( such as those that work for fox news ) . the economist offers news with an agenda that does not always correspond to america 's . it is a great resource for furthering ones knowledge of the world , from politics to economics to science to the arts . best of all , the articles ( except for the special report ) are concise , allowing for an easy read .
1	here are the great things about this magazine subscription 1. the unbeatable price , metal edge is $ 36 and it sucks 2 . it has very interesting articles , artists tattoos a bunch more 3.free music downloads ! ! ! overall this is an awesome magazine , beating metal edge and hit parader into the ground . unlike the other rock mags here you do n't see mainstream bands like slipknot on every other page , it cover the lesser known bands too . the picture and paper quality is excellent . again subscribe now ! !
0	i hope i get program to receive it next month patty jone
1	i 'm a subscriber to road track , car and driver , and motor trend . simply put , r is the one i look forward to the most each month . if you 're looking for a well-rounded auto magazine , this is it . in r you 'll find : -road tests and first drives . -an excellent `` ampersand '' monthly feature with all the latest info on future cars and prototypes . -news about the latest races and drivers . -top-notch photography and art . -witty columnists . ( see side glances by peter egan ) -the occasional technology-related feature . -classic cars , classic drivers , classic tracks . the best historical content in the business . -very little content on suvs . ( a positive in my book ) the competitors : car and driver has substantially more road tests and previews , and some good specialty features on a pretty regular basis , but hardly anything on racing and history . frankly , motor trend is n't anything to write home about . the articles are shorter and less captivating , they ca n't seem to settle on a design theme , and they also have a lack of racing and historical content . if i had to pick just one , road track would definitely be my choice .
0	how 's j-lo doing ? are jennifer and brad pitt still together ? what are the olsen twins up to ? is orlando bloom a hottie or what ? ? well ... who the hell cares ? ? ? i got better things to care about than some news about these celebrities -- people i 've never actually met , let alone `` know . '' please , teenagers should be steered away from this kind of worthless , trashy magazine ( other examples include seventeen , ym , teen people , and the list goes on ) . there are other issues which happen to be more important , you know . try national geographic or the new yorker instead . the newspapers are also good
1	i love this magazine mainly because i am a figure and fitness competitor . it has great tips . if you are not competitor and just love to workout , this magazine is for you , too ! you will get motivated by every article and meal plans ! i do not recommend magazine for individuals who are just looking to get toned and not to cut body fat to supreme low levels . oxygen can at times overly advertise the supplements . i used to get shape mag but i did not like the models in that mag . they looked way too small to be advertising fitness . i highly recommend this mag for those individuals are intersted in competitions !
0	`` spin '' is an accurate name for something like this -- a lot of hype , for an innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine . if rolling stone is the dirty old geezer of rock magazines , then spin is the teenager who tries hard to convince you he 's cool by name-dropping the strokes . spin covers some of the same turf as rolling stone and blender , but less lasciviously -- lots of coverage of popular bands . some of them are quite good -- the hives , for example , or indie newcomer steve burns ( who quit his job on `` blues clues '' after hearing a flaming lips album , and reinvented his life as a rocker ) . unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands are hot at the moment , and then overemphasize them again -- as well as tacking them up in whatever `` coolest '' / '' best '' lists they chalk up for the year/decade/century/history of rock . indie cred is maintained by a few half-page articles on potentially hot bands like the comas and metric , but this info is halfhearted . it 's like they 're reluctant to tear themselves away from articles on better-known bands , regardless of talent . the writing , however , has that certain affliction that a lot of major rock magazines have : the need to be cool . their writers always are trying to be funny , but rarely come across that way . it seems silly and strained , like a soccer mom wearing a spandex tube dress . even the cd reviews are mediocre . however , one recent highlight is dave eggers ' columns -- witty , funny , and a little bit skewed . in fact , they are often the best things in the entirety of the magazine . one of the problems is the emphasis on stuff in hollywood . scarlett johanssen is a wonderful actress , yes . but she does n't sing , nor has she appeared in a music-based movie -- jack black yes , scarlett no . and what is up with party coverage on tv starlet mischa barton and mtv couples ? check out sublimely indie mags like chord , filter , under the radar and the online kludge for in-depth looks at some worthy bands . as for spin ? it 's still trying to convince us it 's cool , but eggers is the only regularly cool thing about it
1	you will see for your self why i like this magazine when you bought it & amp ; did you see her big ass
1	i grew up reading fangoria , when i could sneak it past my parents , that is . fangoria magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article . now you are not always going to agree with everything they say , but you can always expect them to be honest . when a horror icon is not performing up to snuff , like stephen king or john carpenter , they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws . fangoria also has the chainsaw awards , where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie , actor , ect , and you can also submit a name for horror hall of fame ( my guy has yet to win it ) . they also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people ; like the japanese and italian horrors ( wow , they can make some splatter flicks ) , and more independent films that would n't be showing at the mainstream theater . and they have pictures . all the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color ( though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s ) . this is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan , i whole heartedly recomend it
1	i love this magazine and have just ordered a subscription for my daughter too . very good value for the money
1	i absolutely love this magazine ! this is a wonderful read for any who like short stories and mysteries ! the magazine includes new writers as well as more well known ones . a wonderful magazine
0	i was looking forward to another oprah magazine with great joy . unfortunately , the pomp and circumstance within `` o at home '' 's pages is a real turnoff for me , an average , middle-class american living , as they say in `` middle america '' . although i hesitate to say this in print , it 's been in my head for ahile now . i am a faithful 20-year oprah viewer but something has begun to change in her attitude and it is evidenced in this new magazine . is it possible that oprah has not only forgotten her roots , but has now skipped over all the stages in between her roots and now living in a gazillion-square-foot house in malibu ? is it possible that she has forgotten the 90 % of us who live somewhere in between ? if this magazine is an indication , then sadly , she has
1	i absolutely love this magazine . i look forward to sitting and enjoying it every month . i only wish it would be a weekly magazine because i ca n't wait for the next edition . i use so many ideas from romantic homes . keep those great ideas coming
1	harper 's has been in business since 1850 and has published some of the greatest american- writers , from mark twain on down . its editor and tone- setter is the veteran journalist lewis lapham . it publishes fiction , and articles including interesting symposia on many aspects of american economic , political and cultural life . it attracts the big - names in all areas , and also provides a lot of human - interest material , statistical curiosities , historical information and stories . for some reason which i do not fully understand it has never been my great favorite . and in the old days i preferred 'the atlantic ' and the 'saturday review of literature ' to it . of course one of the features of 'harper 's is its book- reviews done by among others today , john leonard . i suppose what has soured me a bit on 'harper 's ' is its bias to the political left . but that withstanding it still provides a rich mix of articles of high quality
0	this is a great magazine , but do n't order it through amazon . they go through a third party ( snapse magazine ) that has terrible customer service . i ordered this magazine in january and six months later ... still no magazine . i called snapse twice and was told they had no record of the order ( even though i received an email confirmation from amazon and i have a 17 digit confirmation number ) . they said they would research it and get back to me . no one called or emailed me the status , so two weeks later i called them again . they acted as if i had just placed the order and told me it takes 6 to 8 weeks to receive the first issue . i wo n't get my first issue until august . buyer beware ... it could take seven months before you receive your first issue .
0	the pages of men 's journal used to be an escapist weekend getaway in themselves . they brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9/11 . since that time , mj has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be , which might have been fine for one issue . this is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas
0	we never receive the zoo books , so i am not sure how they are illustrated . my son is very disappointed . i hope no one else orders from zoo books , and if you have i hope you have not had the same problems as us . i have never had any problems with any of the merchants from amazon.com . hopefully since i never receive the magazine as promise after emails and phone calls to them , they can at least reimburse us for the purchase amount
1	if you want a magazine based on fashion but merged with stories and interviews of top celebrities , then w magazine is perfect for you . this large magazine is not only interesting , but beautiful . it has pages and pages of high quality , remarkable photos . not to mention tons of beautiful fashion ads . if you live for fashion , or if you simply admire it ; you will get latched onto w. celebrities such as kate moss , mary kate olsen lindsay lohan have graced the cover of this magazine . pick it up even if you 're the slighest bit interested . you wo n't be disappointed
1	this is one of the bibles for anyone in graphic design , advertising , illustration or photograhy . it digs deep into industry trends , features portfolios of upcoming industry stars , and is a must for anyone who takes their craft seriously . while the issues are great , their regional design annual is the must-buy issue every year . it really lets you know who the cream of the crop are . just flipping through it will make you better at what you do ( and you 'll even stop using hackneyed phrases like `` cream of the crop '' )
1	i find the woman 's day magazine a helpful source of information for myself , my family and my friends . as i go through the articles and information in the magazine , i note items of interest for my husband and i ( we are retired seniors ) , and for my daughter who has two children . since the news that my son and his wife are expecting , i also save information for them . i have tried some of the recipes and were very pleased . thank you for putting out such a great magazine
1	i love this magazine , the images are crisp , the writing consistantly to quality and the photography is always fabulous . let 's face it when a magazine coins a phrase , you know it 's good . i have read gq for several years and have found it consistantly good , though i must confess the only part that i consider must read every month is style guy , i do n't always agree with him , but i love the questions , you really wonder if these people have ever picked up the magazine the are writing to..one never knows . the clothes they feature are usually top shelf , uh with top shelf prices as well..i mean a $ 2000 pair of alligator lofers..you got ta love it . if you have any interest in the latest styles and some great writing as well , then i highly recommend this book to you , though frankly i ca n't imagine anyone reading this that does not already have an opinion of this iconic magazine..but if you do n't then by all means pick it up and form your own opinion..it 's worth the effort
0	i remember back in the middle '90s this magazine was think ... probably anywhere between 1.5-2.5 inches ... it contained ads , reviews , supplier lists , benchmarks and sometimes trial software ... well i have picked one up sense them ... and they are now a centimeter thick ( if your lucky ) they contain ... reviews that are well written or well read , and a whole lot of ads ... my conclusion do n't buy it ... if you want reviews buy pc magizine or pc world ... and if you want ads ... surf the internet
1	saveur has been a guilty pleasure for me for some time . guilty because it is hard to take serious a magazine with such a hoity sounding name ... and admittedly some of the travel-and-food stories are just on the edge of self-indulgent , self-concious behaviour . they laugh at me at home ( or used to ) for reading it . what makes it good is the content . the cover story each issue is usually a `` destination '' article , focused on a particular area and its food ( cuisine is the wrong word here ) , written in a personal vein , with beautiful photos , and this is the heart of the magazine . but the other content is equally beautiful and it is amazing how many of the recipes actually are useful and have become mainstays for me ... not just something good looking . hide the cover if you must , but i think this is the best `` foodie '' magazine
0	i can not review this item because a month later , i still have not received the first issue of my subscription . sorry frank caldero
0	the company is taking for ever to send me the magazines i ordered . they has charged my account over 3 months ago and not yet deliver a single copy of its magazines . when i call the company they dont have a number to call or a way they can be accounted for their wrong doing . iwant my magazines or my money back not any more sory we are sendingt it to you ... .
0	after reading a review here mentioning subscription issues i went directly to american artists web site and ordered a subscription . that was november 23 , 2005 and now feb. 10 , 2006 still no magazine . when i finally complained i got a request to send my credit info again to vnu @ espcomp.com . ca n't say from looking at that address that i have confidence i was communicating with american artist or a magazine publisher . would you send your credit info ... i think not . i 'd say do n't blame amazon as a previous reviewer did . hey , the magazine is good if you can get a subscription
1	american heritage is a fine magazine brought to us by the same publishers who bring us forbes magazine . it is a magazine that examines history in all shapes and forms , examining past events and cultural changes that have shaped the american nation . one thing about this magazine that you will notice right away is that it is not just a magazine about american political history or the type of history that you remember from your school days . it does talk about this type of history , but it also includes stories about music , art , and other topics , breaking them apart and explaining how and why things happened the way they did and how they compare to the present . it also points out facts from the past that are more obscure , making for some very stimulating reading . current events are also covered in this magazine , and in these instances , american heritage discusses present- day phenomena from an intellectual and critical standpoint , often comparing it to similar events in the american past . this helps to keep the magazine current and more in- tune with important issues of the day . history buffs will love this magazine , and so will those of an intellectual persuasion . the articles here are more thoughtful than other magazines and many of them require greater concentration . for these reasons , american heritage is not really a casual reading type of publication . it is intended for those who like to read , think , discuss , and debate . it 's one of my favorite magazines of its kind on the market today .
0	i ordered this thinking it was a magazine , it is more like a newspaper . it has good information , but it was not what i thought it would be .
1	not as deep as macworld but worth the subscription due to the alternative perspective on software and hardware . very fun to read with a unique style of writing . the reviews can rarely be spotty with lack of depth as the culprit in some cases . the majority , though , are on target . the best part of the magazine are the unique 3rd party hardware finds . overall a great addition and enjoyable read
1	i subscribe to entertainment weekly , premiere , and any magazine with a photo of johnny depp or hobbits on the cover , but scr ( i ) pt is my favorite magazine . every issue of scr ( i ) pt has articles by the screenwriters of movies that are just opening , explaining something about how the movie was written and featuring excerpts from the screennplay of that movie . these are triply helpful , as they ( 1 ) provide insight into how a successful screenwriter works his craft , ( 2 ) supply brief examples of what the movie you just saw ( or are about to see ) looks like on the page , and ( 3 ) are a useful tool in deciding which movie to go see saturday night . each issue also has articles of the more general how to ... variety , although these range from how to write great scenes/characters to how to pitch to studios to why studio execs are using your script to wrap fish . for a while there was a series of articles that were simply a compilation of all the genre cliches , written in the hopes that if you knew what they were you could avoid them ; they were invariably hilarious . these how to/writing advice articles are often extremely funny ( this is not meant as an insult -- they are meant to be funny as well as helpful ) . finally , every issue has the news on sales , contest winners , and whatnot that is essential for any working screenwriter , with a generous helping of heartwarming success stories to keep your spirits up while you 're waiting to hear from the studios . i highly recommend this magazine . enjoy
1	quite frankly this is the only cooking magazine i have ever subscribed to that i actually have looked forward to using and to receiving every two months . i like it so much i am writing my first amazon review ! the format of the magazine makes it easy to follow the recipes - they are always printed on two pages across from each other - and unlike some of the other posters i prefer the black and white format so that the paper is thicker and does n't tear easily . having tear away ads ( for their own products ) on the outside of the magazine means that the usable portion does n't take up much space on my shelf . the recipes are easy to follow and usually clear . when they include specialized ingredients there is usually also a substitution listed . their product reviews are terrific - i wish i had n't wasted so many dinners on bad whole wheat pasta . my only gripe , as someone who does not have a dishwasher , is the great number of bowls and kitchen tools the recipes require . i have made at least half the recipes from the magazines , many several times , which is no small feat for a `` flexitarian '' who never has meat as a main dish .
1	after been loaned this issue of june 2004 , by a committed , really genuine episcopalian , i was greatly impressed ! these creative , unique articles captured my imagination : `` what is power ? '' by sam keen ; `` taking the first step '' by anna lappe` ; `` accessing sacred energy , '' by judith orloff , md ; `` the making of a chaplain '' by karen o'brien ( so like the pages of my earlier verbatim in cpe ) . `` the best spiritual books '' are reviews of 50 out of 300 books by fred and mary ann brussat ! we surely agreed on the first few named : `` the heart of christianity '' marcus borg ; `` beyond belief '' elaine pagels ; `` the wisdom way of knowing '' cynthia bourgeault ; ++ `` the lord is my shepherd '' rabbi kushner+ `` the power of patience '' by m j ryan ! i am still in the whirlwind of those emotionally stimulating , artistically written articles on varied yet potent topics of food for thought and reflection . retired chaplain fred w hood
1	real simple is exactly what the name implies . there is no clutter on the pages , which is fitting because this is the best magazine for people combatting clutter . it 's excellent for those individuals that ca n't multi-task well and never throw anything away
0	i have yet to receive even one issue . i looked on the in touch magazine sight and it said that i have already received 6 issues . i will never order a magazine subscription through this company or through amazon again
1	i subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the conte nast traveler , and i 'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire . this magazine has articles about places not about ( as one other reviewer wrote ) articles about martinis , fashion etc . it also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers . it probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one
0	i echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here : the magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week . how many times is a reader going to see no talents such as jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , the tom cruise-katie holmes joke , and the most overrated , overhyped people of all time brad pitt and angelina jolie on the cover and not get tired of it ? it 's nice to know what 's going on with certain celebrities once in a while but every single week ? can you say `` overkill ? '' i 'm glad i never got a subscription to this magazine . i picked it up every once in a while on the newsstand but stopped because i was so sick and tired of reading about overrated , overhyped and glorified b-movie `` actors '' and `` actresses '' who were lucky to be in one successful movie and have n't done anything of value since . i picked up a copy today and have sworn it off forever . do n't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom
1	i 've been a subscriber of e magazine ( which stands for the environmental magazine ) for over a year now and i love it . it is , by far , the best environmentally oriented magazine i 've come across . all of the ads are for environmentally-friendly companies and products , i now purchase products at at least 50 % of the places advertised in this magazine . e magazine covers topics all over the world , including global warming , horse meat ( popular in europe ) , whaling , deforestation , etc . if you are concerned or interested in environmental issues , i would highly recommend a subscription to this magazine . the issues are bi-monthly but are absolutely action-packed and fact-filled . subscribe today
0	a friend once said to me , `` if you want a glossy that is a no brainer then get vogue ! '' how right she is , despite having glorious photography , fashion models that dare n't stand sideways or you would n't be able to see them and the occasional good article in it , i have to admit i find vogue too pretentious . vogue wants to be the voice of fashion , the voice of the high brow media but its clientele are the likes of you and me , ordinary people who ca n't afford to live the high life they are portraying on its gloss filled pages . personally i 'd rather spend my money on a movie ticket , i get to see a good thriller , sci-fi , romance etc , etc i do n't have to know about the substence abuse and emotional demons that haunt a particular actor 's life , i 'm just interested in enjoying myself for a couple of hours before i go back to my hard working life in the real world . vogue is trying to sell me a dream that i do n't really want to buy into , never had a penchant for selling my soul to the devil , it 's gets two stars though because the photography is really superb , shame about the rest of it though
1	this is not my favorite fitness magazine . this is the size of a reader 's digest , but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine . i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover . they share reasonable and attainable goals , and suggestions for us normal people . the magazine seems to cover a wide age group , with information that is good for both young and old . they do offer recipes , workout suggestions , and much more . the magazine takes little time to read , and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy . i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase
0	i ordered on 10/4/2005 . as of march 27th , i still have n't received the first issue , i do n't even want it now ! how do i get credit for the payment made back in october
0	they allowed me to try one issue before i paid for the subscription . after i read the first issue , i decided to cancel . there are a couple of good topics but the articles were poorly written , for example , you could n't see clearly what the conclusions or recommendations are . the rest of the magazines are all advertisements , which you can get for free from the internet ( or just anywhere )
0	i have n't received this item . it has been almost two months
0	while i rarely subscribe to magazines , i was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so i signed up for a one year subscription to shape . before and during college i was a ballet dancer , but after entering the real , 9-5 working world half a year ago , exercise time became more difficult to find . unfortunately , i found that shape magazine was not really about exercise at all . it was about beauty products , fancy new-age spas and resorts , and trendy workout accessories . i was also shocked by the models on the magazine 's covers and pages . not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing . i finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through , lacy top on the front of it , visible nipples and all . workout wear ? i think not ! trust me , the woman belonged in a porn magazine , not my exercise magazine
1	as someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier , organic way of life , i decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter . many did not strike my fancy . for example , i found organic style magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste , while mind , body , and spirit fitness seems a little too redundant and does n't cover natural and organic living at all . natural health , however , falls somewhere in between , covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet , natural remedies , beauty , and food/recipes . as someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy , i appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer . though many of the articles do cover ideas and products that are n't entirely natural or organic , i still find them to be useful . many items and articles , though not all , are vegetarian-friendly as well as eco-conscious , which i appreciate . one of my few complaints is that the articles can be short , sometimes merely `` glossing over '' many topics . however , if one piques my interest , it can be a decent jumping off point to do further research . though i ca n't compare with the previous version of the magazine that everyone else seems to have preferred , as i only began to pick this up at my local whole foods market in the last year , i can say that i am impressed with what natural health has to offer it 's readers . sure , there are several ads plaguing the pages , but i still feel as though there are far fewer advertisements than many of the magazines on the shelves today . besides , some of the ads have led me to decent products i would not have known of otherwise . furthermore , at this price , how can anyone really go wrong
1	i like this magazine and i subscribe to it ( along with cooking for two and cook 's country ) , but i do n't think it 's perfect . i like when the magazine offers a several-page article with a formula for pasta salad or muffins , so i can make whatever flavor i choose and know it will turn out well . but the magazine does contain ads , despite what one reviewer claimed
1	interview is one of my favorite magazines . the interviews are always good . i think that the interviews are more candid since it 's done by peers . i also think that the photo shoots in the interview are some of the best around
0	i subscribed in late may to maximumpc and pcgamer . early july i started getting pcgamer . still nothing from maximumpc . i called customer service and they said they had recieved my order june 2nd and to expect my first issue in late september . thats nearly four months ! that is an unreasonable wait relative to the industry standard and clearly outside the stated wait on the order form . i gave one star because the magazine is a good magazine . but at a $ 8.99 news stand price it is too expensive ... so i am left with the choice of spending almost $ 35 to get the four months worth before my subscription starts ( more than the subscription itself ) or just missing out on those issue . very poor customer service .
0	i made my subscription in january 23 , and it said shipped february 2 2007 and im still waiting for it ! today is march 19 200
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life . instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting - which is possible - people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images , people we will never meet , and in many cases people who have very little going for them . does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything , or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence ? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j.lo is engaged ( in order to get on the cover of another magazine ) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns
1	casino player is the end-all magazine for the serious gambler ( and the gambler who likes weekend fun with lots of comps ! ) . it is one of the pricier magazines , but the cost is well worth it , and it is n't over-run with advertising . the letters to the editor touch on basic gaming , slot , and comp questions , and i always glean useful information from the q section . the magazine content covers slot machines , video poker strategy and probability , table game strategy and expected pay-offs , investing in the gaming industry 's publicly-held corporations , and reviews of properties , restaurants , and shows . i always read it before heading to vegas to learn what is new and happening on the strip and in the area . casino player provides balanced coverage of vegas , atlantic city , indian properties , and riverboat casinos . as a southern ca native , i usually skim features outside vegas , but the magazine should be commended for reaching out to gamblers in all parts of the country
0	hi , i am writing this review in an attempt to help you save $ 10 . this magazine is an embarrassment in every angle . it is full of pictures of `` sexy '' boys/men dressed in cloths no guy with self esteem would ever wear . and pictures is all there is , for you that think there will be something interesting to read , read this : there is nothing in this magazine to read ! ! ! the latest issue contains of 48 ( forty-eight ) pages before you get to this issues contents . the first `` article '' starts on page 126 ( ! ) and is about `` why a man would like to slice of his testicles '' ! totally the magazine contains of 260 pages and there is text ( letters that forms sentences ) on about 40 of them . besides this , the magazine also has a huge dilemma of being a gay magazine or not . well i can go on and on but i wo n't . unfortunately i have a subscription and i am going to see if i can get it canceled , i do n't even need my money back . take your $ 10 and run them in the disposal , it will be more fun to clean out the disposal than `` read '' this magazine
0	i have yet to receive even one issue . i looked on the in touch magazine sight and it said that i have already received 6 issues . i will never order a magazine subscription through this company or through amazon again
0	change can be good ; however , sometimes change can be very bad . earlier this year pc mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers . before the change this was a magazine that i would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content ; now i can skim it in 5 minutes and do n't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time . as a longtime subscriber ( 20 years ) i will not be re-subscribing to the magazine . i wish them luck , but i believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them
1	fantasy magazine has been around since 1949 , and is in my opinion one of the better scifi and fantasy mags on the market . it has a proven track record of publishing outstanding short stories , novellas , and novelettes that have later gone on to win hugo , nebula , and dark fantasy awards , which brings me to the 2006 june issue of the magazine : the june issue features an outstanding and very creepy novella entitled hallucigenia by laird barron . i predict an award for this chilling novella , which will be just another in a long and esteemed list of award worthy tales from fantasy barron 's story could be classed as a cthulhu mythos tale , although no where does the author allude to h.p . lovecraft 's works . it is simply that the recurring theme is a recognizable one to us mythos fans . highly recommended reading , and worth the subscription price .
1	i 've been a p subscriber and reader ( even when not a subscriber ) for years . i 've also tried various other writers ' magazines , such as the writer and writer 's digest . the latter two were fine when i was just beginning to dip into the freelance market , just beginning to look at publishers for first manuscripts , but when i gained more experience , i soon realized those just did n't make the cut anymore . the articles were too often repetitive and geared towards such elementary basics that i was no longer gaining new insights . p was the next step up . p provides advice , inspiration , informative interviews , current resources for the more experienced and discriminating writer . the bimonthly issues include articles , detailed listings of markets , contests , grants , and helpful , relevant ads . for the price , this is the best magazine available today for the writer who has a portfolio already underway and keeping an ear to the ground for more , staying up to date with what 's rumbling in the literary world . with its up-to-date information , i 've been able to leave the others aside , including that old bible , writer 's market , which was , unfortunately , obsolete the moment it was off the presses . highly recommended for the writer wanting more .
1	relevant magazine has great articles for people who are in to culture and faith . many of the reviews are of secular artists , the spiritual content or message ( or lack thereof ) of the music they sing , films they make and books they write . they also review christian artists , many who are on the fringe . this is a great magazine for those who are interested in these things . if you just want a 'youth-oriented ' christian magazine with bible studies and how-to 's you 'll probably be disapointed
1	remember when the dawn of 24/7 cable news networks seemed to be a godsend ? now we know that that led to 24/7 garbage ( breaking news now means a peek at the food menu served to the self-confessed and deluded killer of jonbenet ramsay , the elevation of trivia to news status to fill time on a slow news day , the absence of any sort of perspective or background , the application of insane levels of urgency to minor health scares , endless celebrity gossip , etc. ) . i had enough of this nonsense . all i wanted was a brief summary of what was important with some context thrown in . all the truly significant news can be relayed in a brief period of time ; the rest is junk meant to fill in the time between commercials . more time spent on news does not mean being better informed because 24/7 news is simply obsession with the same few stories , repeated ad nauseum . i tried the christian science monitor . they have excellent standards but it is expensive to get every day . i then tried this publication . it met my needs . you get a complete summary of everything that was important in the previous week 's news with a minimum amount of fluff . celebrities are lucky to get a paragraph , if anything , in the entire issue . you come away from this magazine ( easily read in an hour ) with a great overview of all that mattered in the previous week . international and world stories get much more coverage than what you see on cnn , fox , or your local paper . there does n't seem to be any bias that i could detect . get this if you want to decrease your time spent on news but still be well informed . move over , you stodgy time and newsweek magazines
1	this magazine if full of fun fashion items ! it shows you some great ideas of how to do things for the upcoming year ! its a definite go ! ! :

0	dear sirs as per your records i purchased the subscribtion to essence magazine on 08/19/2006 . and today 's date is november 6 , 2006 and i 've just recieved my first copy . i hope your company is keeping track of the delay in mailing this product . at this time i can not give this product a rating . respectfully , elizabeth de jesu
0	i send away for a 2 year subscription , they sent me a 1 year sub , i wrote 5 letters , sent copies of bank cheque and order form , emailed them , no response , they could care less , what more can i do ?
0	unless you want the editor 's liberal political views shoved down your throat , avoid this magazine . it leans to the left so hard that you have to lie on your side to even read it . ( and no , i am not a republican or democrat , but an independent who looks at all sides ) . the editor of this magazine has a huge agenda to get the democrats back in power , he bashes bush and the republican party over the head with a 10-ton hammer on a monthly basis , yet worships eco-phonies like laurie david and celebrities who want the rest of us to drive eco-friendly cars while they fly the world in their private jets . ( i understand laurie and her friends like sheryl crow are `` trying '' to wean themselves off this practice by cutting down on their private jet hopping trips a wee bit and using a huge gas guzzling bus that is criss-crossing the country instead , but that poor laurie is finding this hard to give up . what hyprocrites these hollywood folks are ! ) though i am personally trying to do my bit for the environment , i hate when i read issues like the current `` green '' issue where these so called eco-environmentalists really only want us `` common people '' to make the changes . this used to be a great fashion , entertainment and current event magazine with a lot of in-depth articles , but now it is only a political platform publication . i now will just throw it away as soon as it arrives when i receive it , until my subscription expires
1	esquire may be a man 's magazine , but i enjoy the articles as a woman , because it is no holes barred feedback with the rough edges included . i got my first issue a couple weeks back , and found it funny , informative , great pic of tom petty , and i 'm looking forward to more issues
0	i subscribed in late may to maximumpc and pcgamer . early july i started getting pcgamer . still nothing from maximumpc . i called customer service and they said they had recieved my order june 2nd and to expect my first issue in late september . thats nearly four months ! that is an unreasonable wait relative to the industry standard and clearly outside the stated wait on the order form . i gave one star because the magazine is a good magazine . but at a $ 8.99 news stand price it is too expensive ... so i am left with the choice of spending almost $ 35 to get the four months worth before my subscription starts ( more than the subscription itself ) or just missing out on those issue . very poor customer service .
1	`` as we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of human happiness , we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people . '' ~p.g . wodehouse , something new creative advertising ( love the ge firefly ad ) , practical advice for your home and luxurious perfumes all blend effortlessly throughout the pages of real simple . there i was wondering when i should replace a down comforter and this magazine had the answer . they also have some lovely quotes and ideas for decorating your home with liz claiborne home items , like the lovely bedding and towels . the do it yourself features are fun with ideas like a hostess gift you make up yourself with a basket and candles . loved the articles like `` organizing your recipes ; 8 foolproof methods . '' but their advice on tossing cookbook in favor of just keeping a few recipes ! hello . there are some cookbooks you definitely want to keep . they always seem to put a spin on old favorites , like the modern cheesecake that is gourmet and elegant . the applesauce cake in the november issue uses chunky applesauce so people might think you spent all that time chopping apples . ~the rebecca review
0	this is not the health magazine you 'd expect from martha stewart -- it 's extremely heavy on advertisements ( 45 % at my rough count ) , and really cluttered , and just not `` good '' . the recipes are interesting , if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin-hydration ads
0	i ordered this as a gift subscription on may 10 . by july 20 , it still had not arrived . i contacted customer service , and was told it would n't arrive until september ! the description says it will take 6-10 weeks . it has now been 10 weeks , and i 've been informed it will be another 6 weeks
1	the smartest , best-informed , and most , well , entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture . i read it cover to cove
0	it is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head . it skims the surface and is 'pop ' . anyone reading this would be entertained but be none the wiser about what is going on in the real world . again it is a shame if this is all people have to read on what is going on in the world ( newsweek is exactly the same ) especially in the united states . time magazine is from the same people that gave us cnn and is unfortunately symptomatic of the liberal media and the inexorable consolidation of all media particularly in the u.s. and the resulting blandness and lack of real choice . the other irritating thing about time is it 's tone which is patronising and a little supercilious . subscribe to the economist , there are less pictures !
1	men 's journal has got ta be one of the best deals in the whole wide world of magazines . for 10 bucks you get wonderful photography , health tips , product reviews of cool stuff you 'll covet , smart writing and , of course , regular features by that greatest of american ink-spillers , jim harrison . heck , if they just photo copied the harrison pieces and sent them to me in a plain white envelope , ten bucks would still be a screaming deal . however , i still dig the fashion spreads , the book notes and the travel writing . there is a consistant sense of adventure , curiosity and life well lived in this magazine , which is why it should earn a spot on your coffee table . did i mention it 's only ten bucks
0	i also bought this magazine sight-unseen and i wish i had n't . for re-decorating purposes , i found this magazine to be not useful at all . the homes and gardens are pretty , but what they feature ( furniture , wall and window coverings ) just would not go with the middle-class home ... way too opulent . i was wanting more of a magazine that could give me a look that can be found in local or chain furniture stores ... not that would try to make me get a one-of-a-kind table from xyz antique store in new york . also , i found this magazine text-heavy . all in all , an ok magazine for a professional decorater maybe , but not for a average home-owner trying to redecorate
0	should i require more information on asphalt , i 'll subscribe to the practical paving newsletter , maybe attend the world of asphalt 2007 show conference . in the meantime , the `` world 's leading bike magazine '' has whet the appetite with a dozen-page spread on the stuff in their september '06 issue . on a positive note , the giro helmet ad with floyd landis is sure to become a collectible
1	i have a one yr old who enjoys babybug and a 2 yr old who enjoys ladybug . these are just the best children 's publications . we save every babybug for posterity because the art is fantastic . ca n't recommend these enough to family and friends .
1	ok , the advertisements are a bit much , but the magazine is great . my son has subscriptions to cricket and kids discover , too . he has had many other magazine subscriptions over the years , and this one stands out to me because , unprompted , he has always found fun information that he felt was worth sharing . this magazine was also a favorite with my niece who does not like to read at all . the magazine format is easy to read , yet rich in content
1	this is the intelligent fashion magazine that does n't treat fashion lovers like idiots ! great in depth articles on screenplays , celebs , charities , politics , and of course - fashion . duh !
0	i ordered kiplingers and us news on march 25 and was immediately charged for both subscriptions . today is october 12th and i 've never received us news . i 've complained several times and been given a variety of excuses and promised a refund and free subsciption which of course i have n't received . when i requested a refund of course i was given the wrong amount . if you want to order magazines i agree with the last reviewer go to another site because while amazon is great for books that have n't got the magazine business straight . also , the customer service phone numbers are wrong and this is a total mess .
0	back in the 1970 's my grandmother subscribed to prevention . at that time , it was a wonderful magazine , filled with informative articles aimed at the `` prevention '' of illness and the promotion of wellness ( as the founder of prevention , j.i . rodale had preached ) . articles about the role of vitamins and nutrition were light years ahead of their time . ( j.i . can be given a lot of credit for bringing vitamins and supplements to the mainstream ) . over the years , and especially after the tragic death of robert rodale ( j.i . 's son ) , and the takeover by his wife and daughter , it has unfortunately transformed into a fluffy , tabloid-like `` women 's magazine '' with scantily clad women on the covers , and one- or two-page articles instructing women to get killer abs and burn the fat . i think j.i . rodale is probably spinning in his grave to see what his descendents have done to butcher this magazine , which bears no resemblence whatsoever to what it used to be . i flipped through a copy in disgust recently to note , as another reviewer has stated , plenty of ads for drugs which really seems to go against the idea of preventing illness in the first place ( whereas the old prevention sang the praises of vitamins and health foods ) . i do n't know why the rodale family does n't just scrap the title and call it something else , but alas , they are a major corporation now and i have little hope that this magazine will improve any time soon
1	this is the most accurate geo-political and socio-economic english-language news-weekly there is . period . articles are succinct , top-notch , and cover everything from the world today to business , economics to the environment . i do think the magazine tends to focus a bit too little on the environment and religion , but that is my perception . despite the editorial style and very sophisticated diction , articles are still easy to understand . true , this magazine ( or newspaper , as it calls itself ) is staunchly pro-democracy ( i.e . broadly speaking , anti-russian policy , anti-chinese policy in their respective conflicts , say , over georgia or taiwan , and pro-war on the iraq issue ) , pro-free trade , and pro-european ( i.e . for the expansion of the eu ) . but it takes many conservative and liberatarian positions , too , and oftentimes even liberal ones , which , overall , makes the magazine fairly objective - you 'll usually get all or most of the points-of-view after reading just a few articles on the same subject , although the economist usually does imply , or sometimes downright state , which position it takes or the world must take . actually that 's the best part : it is very refreshing to have a magazine that is not afraid to share its opinion and offer its advice to readers , hence its influence . this , for me , is the icing on the cake . as an economics and international relations student , i have been receiving the economist for some three years already . in that short time span , it has been a source -- usually the main source -- of dozens of my essays and country reports ( the country or topical surveys published every several weeks are excellent for this ! ) and reading the magazine has increased my english vocabulary significantly . i finally feel that my vocabulary has increased from third-grade level to college-level . yes , it does indeed take a few weeks to get used to the unique writing style , but the magazine is indispensible . to some it may appear arrogant , which is what i tend to sense at times , but that does not mean it is a bad magazine . quite simply , it tends to think of itself as sophisticated , and rightfully so . while half-owned by the financial times , many of the economist 's authors also write for the latter , which can help explain while the two are similar . but while the financial times is a daily newspaper with fairly brief articles and a 50-50 slant on news and finance/business , the economist 's articles , while also succinct , focus on everything in the world that impacts people . and that is why it 's an excellent summary of the world this week for those people with little time on their hands . finally , i do not necessarily sense an anti-semitic slant as stated in one previous review . yes , i am jewish , but i tend to regard the economist 's proposed solutions -- such as dealing with hamas politically ( despite their `` militancy '' ) , as they can not be destroyed -- to of the middle east conflict as mere pragmatism at work . the same with its proposal to legalize various drugs . not that both of these things will ever happen in today 's world ( the mid-east conflict wo n't end ; drugs wo n't be decriminalized in most countries ) , but the thinking is purely pragmatic , which is refreshing for a world so increasingly bent on political correctness . in this respect , as in the aforementioned ones , i feel the magazine is a lot more objective overall than many others , despite the specific positions it takes in particular articles . it makes for a truly fascinating read . it is most surely the investment it claims to be , so for any of those with any remaining doubts , the $ 129 subscription price ( $ 77 for students ) is more than worth it . just read three or four issues and you 'll see . trust me
0	trashy magazine , it only focuses on sex . like if sex is going to solve your emotional problems . this culture is so obssesed with sex . if you really want to read about relationships , i recommend `` save your marriage before it starts '' it gives you real info from two psychologist why marriage is going downhill and how you can save it
1	real simple is exactly what the name implies . there is no clutter on the pages , which is fitting because this is the best magazine for people combatting clutter . it 's excellent for those individuals that ca n't multi-task well and never throw anything away
1	as someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier , organic way of life , i decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter . many did not strike my fancy . for example , i found organic style magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste , while mind , body , and spirit fitness seems a little too redundant and does n't cover natural and organic living at all . natural health , however , falls somewhere in between , covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet , natural remedies , beauty , and food/recipes . as someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy , i appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer . though many of the articles do cover ideas and products that are n't entirely natural or organic , i still find them to be useful . many items and articles , though not all , are vegetarian-friendly as well as eco-conscious , which i appreciate . one of my few complaints is that the articles can be short , sometimes merely `` glossing over '' many topics . however , if one piques my interest , it can be a decent jumping off point to do further research . though i ca n't compare with the previous version of the magazine that everyone else seems to have preferred , as i only began to pick this up at my local whole foods market in the last year , i can say that i am impressed with what natural health has to offer it 's readers . sure , there are several ads plaguing the pages , but i still feel as though there are far fewer advertisements than many of the magazines on the shelves today . besides , some of the ads have led me to decent products i would not have known of otherwise . furthermore , at this price , how can anyone really go wrong
1	i greatly enjoyed reading this magazine in years past . however , i have not received anything yet from my amazon.com order . i am eagerly waiting for my subscription to start ! !
0	i never bought gq back in my 20s because for one thing , i never thought of myself as a clothes-horse . also , i actually took the g in gq to mean that it was actually for gentlemen , ie , sipping champagne on a yacht pass me the the caviar type gentlemen . well , after now having reached a `` certain age '' i find myself going back and forth between esquire and gq and find that in many cases , neither are exactly right for me . however , i think i 've bought my last episode of gq . the 2006 `` interview '' with will ferrel was interesting for the first three paragraphs , and then it became an excercise in self referentialism , disguised as an attempt at wit . also , the politics of the magazine are unabashedly anti-bush administration , which would be ok except for the fact that i 'm not reading gq for political content . there are plenty of magazines out there make this their specialty , and when i find it in gq , its just tiresome . frequently , swipes at bush and his policies just come out of nowhere in an article , as if the editor decided that a jab at bush and his policies might help the piece , regardless of its content . not to mention - does anyone actually wear the clothing they put on display ? $ 800 tennis shoes ? i fear that i will be an esquire reader - i ca n't bear to become a `` men 's best life '' subscriber just yet
1	i 've been a subscriber for over fifteen years , and will probably continue to subscribe until the day i die . but at times i find national geographic frustrating . i have no interest in soccer , nor do i want a huge fold-out map discussing the sport . are n't there more phenomenal things going on in the world today ? also , geographic does have its pet topics . how many articles must we read about pandas ? a dozen ? i like pandas , believe me , but surely there are other less cute animals to discuss . also i could do without lectures and pc environmental propaganda . the articles about oil-drilling in alaska was filled with a thinly veiled agenda which was preachy and annoying . yeah , we get it , you do n't want alaska drilled . can we move on , please ? other articles are quite interesting . i enjoy the zip code discussion , the old-fashioned pictures , and articles about countries . i could do with fewer articles about underwater archaeology though , and the articles filled with preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring . a friend of mine ( a joe average type guy ) , said he stopped subscribing to geographic because the articles were depressing him . i tried to argue with him , because i think the magazine is great- but i do kind of have to agree , the topics of late are downbeat and are n't particularly uplifting . i do believe the magazine is getting a little 'out there ' with its choice of topics , too . i recommend this magazine for those interested in the environment and the world around them
1	you can tell a lot about the readership a men 's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads . in the issue in front of me , they flog the lincoln mkz , range rover sport , and audi a6 . there you have it . we 're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who wo n't even become aware that the lincoln town car and audi a8 exist until he turns 55 . well , 52 maybe . but you did n't need the cars to figure out men 's health . it 's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs ( in reality or in their dreams ) can generally snag : expensive suits , beautiful women who seem never not to pout , and beefy arms to set off those abs . to be fair , there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages . but i doubt that 's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of , say , dog fanciers . in spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured , there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world . and if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that 's on offer in men 's world , where there 's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you . do n't mistake this monthly for serious journalism . but you wo n't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either . i kind of like it
1	... i highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry . i have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas , reference , or to simply get those creative juices flowing . how 's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship . how does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business
0	today i purchased my first and probably last issue of gourmet . while there were plenty of recipes ( some of which i wo n't use but they were still cool to look at ) there were tons of ads . it makes you wonder either a ) how much the people who make this magazine get paid or b ) for all the ads why this is n't free . i can see the need for a few ads so that we the consumers do n't have to pay a fortune for a good magazine . but i took out 33 pages of ads and figured there were about 140 full page ads . that 's over half of the magazine which is 260 pages . that 's really sad . recipe wise , some of them look interesting and very gourmet , but there are things you need to have that i ca n't get in the middle of the u.s. and about three of the six articles were interesting to read - when you could find them slipped inbetween their plethora of ads . fine cooking is still the best one out there
1	i have been a subscriber to threads since it 's inaugural issue , and have saved every one . the publishers , writers and editors have uncompromising standards for accuracy , originality and inspiration . while the magazine has evolved over the years , and away from accessory crafts such as knitting , it has nevertheless remained the premier publication for fine sewing . some articles are geared towards the advanced sewers , but many basic techniques and information are shown and explained more clearly , in more easy to understand depth , than any other publication of it 's type . the pictures and diagrams are professional and clear . the instructions well written . even the advertising is worth perusing . top caliber all around
0	this is a magazine for paid product-placement in articles , tons of ads , and so-so articles . you are paying for the name , and getting much less in return . i highly recommend fine homebuilding instead of this old house . you will not only see fabulous new and old construction , but actually take something away from it ( that is the point behind magazines , right ? ) a magazine that actually saved me money ! i 'm cancelling my subscription to t.o.h . and adding another year onto my fine homebuilding subscription . it 's money well spent
0	laptop mag can be best described negatively : it 's not a really serious computer magazine . it 's more or less like consumer guide , which is basically paid advertising . this means you ca n't really trust the article here because you do n't know if they are not written by unbiased writers . in the end , i feel this is a waste of money . besides , you can get all the info for free on the web , from cnet or zdnet , anyway
1	i got a subscription for my father on father 's day , and he really likes it . recommend it
1	i 've read other personal finance magazines before and found them to be either too basic to be worth my time , or too focused on some obscure area . i 'm not a financial professional , but i like to constantly increase my knowledge of personal finance . kiplinger 's has been great for that . i skip 80 % of the articles in this magazine , but that still leaves one or two in every issue that teach me about an area i did n't know about -- where to buy bonds online the most cheaply , how to find good financial advice , why options are priced the way they are . one good article pays for the entire annual subscription . each issue has a wide range of articles appealing to lots of levels of experience
1	this magazine is ill ! i learn about all the new albums coming out , read the review , and if they say they are good , i go out and buy 'em . the reviews are also accurate , giving the appropiate number of stars . i also love the sections on the new artists on the verge . the cover stories never seem to dis-please me , always givin ' me plent of info . the mini articles are cool , too , from stuff like warren 's sapp 's all-star football team , to all about how mike jones was discovered . one last thing i love about the magazine - they are never thin issues , and you know what that means ! ! !
1	i do n't know a single super-successful business person , and i know hundreds from coast to coast , who do not read and recommend inc. magazine . inc. is the single best business magazine , bar none
1	this is a great magazine for cat lovers even if you do n't have a cat . it talks about care tips as well as stories about other cats
1	video game magazines have been all the rage in our lives . yet there are just so many of them that tell different stories for different video game systems . that has been the case with one of the biggest-selling ones of all time , gamepro . they truly have made it one the most provocative and well in-depth magazines with detail about what games are popular according to their writers , and what upcoming games and systems are all in the works . the magazine is quite well , but i honestly do wish they could try to publish more in the way of codes and helpful hints for several games for gamecube and game boy advance , when most of it primarily focuses in on playstation 2 xbox . yet , gamepro really handles itself as a very deep gamer 's magazine . anybody who wants to be enjoy the field of video games , this magazine is worth reading . overall : b 1/2
0	for years discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science . now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless . very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science . after buying discover since it 's very inception i find it sad what has happened to this magazine . check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months
1	we 've been receiving your big backyard for a couple of years now and my daughter really looks forward to receiving it each month . the stories are alot of fun to read and it really encourages us to learn and talk about animals that we would n't if we did not receive the magazine . after we read it my daughter enjoys making collages from her favorite pictures . i highly recommend it
0	amazon must think we are fools . it 's $ 4 cheaper directly from stewart 's website . on the other hand , there appear to be a lot of fools here
1	i first came across taste of home magazine about 10 years ago . some friends of mine were quite the experimental couple who loved to try out new recipes . as the recipient of tasty appetizers , dips , and desserts , i asked them for the recipes . it was then that they shared this magazine with me ... and i 've been a subscriber ever since ! each magazine features several special features , as well as mainstay departments such as potluck pleasers , my mom 's best meal , getting in the theme of things , and super snacks and appetizers . arguably the best part of this magazine is their clip-and-keep section of recipes which feature color photos of the dish . just cut out the recipe , and ouila ! it 's ready for your recipe box . other information-packed sections include ask our food editor , touring country kitchens , ted 's toothpick contest , lively leftovers , and more . each issue also features a recipe contest to win cold , hard cash . some of the great recipes that are in the most recent issue include : swiss-stuffed porkchops open-faced turkey tacos spinach shrimp fettuccine coffee 'n ' cream brownies cucumber potato salad asparagus chicken crepes hearty jambalaya barvarian strawberry pie and many more . besides being tasty dishes , one of the great things about the recipes in taste of home is that they do n't call for some exotic ingredients . rather , they feature ingredients that can be found in any department store ... even if you live in an out-of-the-way rural area ! some of the recipes are n't exactly `` quick '' , which is why i give it four stars . there are certainly quite a few quick and easy recipes , but there are also some that take quite a bit of prep work . if you 're looking for a magazine with mostly quick recipes , try their sister publication , quick cooking ( i subscribe to that one , as well ... and actually like it better . ) taste of home has no ads ( amazing ! ) , so it 's nice that the magazine is chock full of recipes and information -- not fillers and ads . this magazine also is very `` country '' , so if you 're looking for something trendy and cosmopolitan , this mag may not be for you . but if you like down-home country cookin ' , you 'll likely love this magazine
1	in the several years since my retirement , i have come to wait by my trusty old rusted metal mailbox around the third or fourth of every month , waiting for my monthly issue of two magazines , the atlantic monthly and harpers . each in iuts own way is likely the best amalgams of intellectual articles on a variety of subjects one can find in contemporary america , and each features a stable of highly regarded writers and authors . for good reason ; from subjects as arcane as the supposed imminent fall of the soviet union based on demographic and economic analysis in the mid-1980s to the recent synopsis of former spy robert baer regarding the evils of dealing with the highly corrupted saudi regime , the magazine consistently offers an erudite , informative , and provocative look at aspects of contemporary reality one can not find elsewhere . needless to say , i really enjoy reading harpers , especially under the guidance of editor lewis lapham , and its articles often lead me on amazon searches for tomes by the talented authors , which in the case of said author robert baer , or perpetually sagacious satirist p.j . o'rourke , or a whole raft of noteable others . all of them lead to some worthwhile reading experiences indeed . it avoids the trendy , so we are spared the suffering through the latest and greatest mass experiences in favor of intellectual roads less traveled , being grassy and rather wont of wear , makes for better and more satisfying traveling , whether trudging through the snow with my wintertime dunham tyroleans or padding down grassy fields in my summertime birkenstocks . just keep on trucking ! enjoy !
0	this magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than $ 100 on babya outfits , etc . it is not a magazine for most of america , but rather for the elite , or those who wish to pretend they are . there are way too many ads , and insignificant articles . parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category .
0	writer 's digest puts out a lot of great resources for writers . the magazine ai n't one of them , however . for starters about half of the magazine is ads - mostly for other writer 's digest products . one you get past paying $ 19.95 a year for what 's essentially a brochure , you 'll notice that most of the articles do n't apply to you . most writers stick to one genre , yet the magazine focuses on all aspects of writing - fiction , poetry , business writing , editing , non-fiction , etc . if you 're working on a biography of j. edgar hoover , do you need to look at an article on poetry in the stlye of ee cummings ? i 'll take `` no '' for $ 600 , alex . so , now you 're down to about 10 pages that might be relevant . well , let 's start chipping away at that : the letters about grammar questions are a waste : if you have a question about affect versus effect , would you write to a magazine and wait a month or two or would you pick up your style guide and have an answer in less time than it took for you to read this sentence ? thought so . ( furthermore the idea that someone would write to a magazine with a question like that is so incredulous one has to wonder if the questions are n't just submitted by staff members in an attempt to fill space , like i used to do when i was the news editor at my college paper . ) writer 's digest does review software and other technology that might be useful to writers . my favorite was when it reviewed microsoft word . thanks - i 'm sure most readers had no idea about the monopolistic word-processing program . to be fair , some of the reviews are useful , although you can get better information just by looking up the product on amazon.com and reading the reviews there . if you 're going to writer 's digest for market information , you 'd be better served elsewhere : the annual writer 's market publication has all the markets and is more thorough , whilst the writer 's market website has all that information and is up-to-date . your money would be better spent on those two products . about the only articles i have found useful are the profiles on authors and how they have succeeded . there you have it : two or three pages an issue that are useful . if you 're trying to get your work published , writer 's digest has several other products that are a better investment than its magazine : go with the annual writer 's market book , the website , and pick up a style manual of your choosing ( chicago is the best ) . do n't waste your money on this magazine
1	eqmm is definitely a worthwhile magazine for any true fan of mysteries . is every story exceptional , of course not and that 's unrealistic to expect it to be . the stories are however entertaining and you get the opportunity to see something from some of your favorite writers . i think it 's enjoyable to read a short story from writers you like whether it is a surefire classic or just another tale . to address , some of the issues by the jaded first reviewer , look at it from the standpoint of a mystery lover . if the publishers only produced great classic books , we would have only a handful of books each year , instead of the masses that readers have the fun of combing thru each year . the pages smudge , but this is not a magazine that is mass produced like people or time or sports illustrated . at the current price , you could probably only get one to two stories a month for glossy pages . if you 're reluctant to get a subscription then at least go to your local bookstore and buy the latest copy of eqmm and find out for yourself how enjoyable getting a quick glimpse into dozen of mystery writers can be
0	do n't get me wrong , occasionally there are issues i still read cover to cover , but it seems as though mj has gone through a change lately . gone is the focus of travel and fantastic adventure writing . now the focus seems to be health , fitness and diet . i used to buy men 's health magazine for those topics . if i wanted that focus i would continue to buy mh . there is no longer a consistent reason to read mj on a regular basis anymore . man , i miss the old mj
1	out of all the magazines i have ever recieved , this is my favorite . the writers and editors have a immense sense of humor and are knowledgable about what they write about . this magazine is creative , funny , and very informative . the articles are very thorough in facts and the writers go to great lengths to write them . although some people may think that this magazine is for kids ; adults enjoy this magazine too ! i know , my parents read my magazine almost right after i 'm done ! they love it ! recently , there was an article about tombs or whatever you call them near paris . i showed the article to my french teacher and she even learned something new ! this magazine should have 10 stars instead of 5 ! -kricke
0	this is not the health magazine you 'd expect from martha stewart -- it 's extremely heavy on advertisements ( 45 % at my rough count ) , and really cluttered , and just not `` good '' . the recipes are interesting , if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin-hydration ads
1	i thought my first issue of your magazine was a little sparse . it was a very thin issue . the models were beautiful . this was good.but you knowif you would include more in depth articlessuch as really in depth stuff about skin and hair . like i said before aging skin needs more done to it and some things like micro-dermabrasion could be helpful . also 8 glasses a water a day is the most helpful thing a woman could do for herself . beside plastic surgery , theres not much for them to do . but i will saythis , to enlarge lips i put a vitamin e capsule on my lips , and then honey and then a good lip moisturizer and leave it on overnight . it doees make the lips plumper . also i use baby powder on my face as a face powder . sometimes i use this just on my nose and chin . sometimes i use half mayonaise and conditioner and mix them together to make the mayonaise smell better on the hair . sometimes i use vitamin oil in my bath water such as vitamin e a person can buy this at the dollar store . im not rich but i do some things to help the way i look at my age . then you could include pictures of mountains and rivers and stories of people . then you could have articles on celebrities like frank converse , robert blake , really interesting ones like that . paul newman has always got something to say interesting . also what ever happened to actor richard hatch who starred in the hitchhikers ? someone told me the other day that the most handsome actor there was or is was yul brynner . i didnt see that as i should . i dont know if you agree with that or not but it would be interesting to see a profile of the way he lived .i like brad pitt and those people are always great . i love jennifer anniston because she she is higher up than most women in her thoughts and actions.angelina jolie i really like too beacause women do like these women . i miss johnny carson and they really need to find someone to replace him . yes there is people like that still in the world . ive found some of them . well thank you
1	each issue of family circle is full of useful information . ordering it through amazon is so easy . a few clicks on the computer and you are done
1	forget about shop etc ... lucky is the best shopping mag by far . i got alot of coupons for full size products an , samples inside of lucky magazine . i love me some free samples ! i am from nyc and you have to know what 's wearing and all , so this mag let me know a whole lot about fashion , makeup , hair produts , house wares etc
1	the weekly standard clearly has a conservatinve `` bent . '' however , it is not the sort that screams , `` this is the only way to think about this topic . '' it is thoughtful commentary , delivered with well crafted writing . i come away from reading an issue thinking that i have been well informed
0	a self absorbed mag that likes to pat itself on the back for feeling pity for the lower 'folks . ' they named cindy sheehan in their january 2006 best of the best issue for 'best stand ! ' they are so diluded they think that 'nut'is making an honorable stand-only by using her son 's honorable death to serve her ego ! secondly , open the edition tom ford and you will be discusted with his self-gloating , and sexist photography of women . i do n't mind nude pictures , but he only uses women-like sex objects . reese witherspoon ( highest paid actress in hollywood ) is showed holding a doll by it 's arm with an empty stare into the lens.the men are portrayed in sexual positions with the women , and the african actors portrayed are dressed in animal skins ! revolting
1	there are two good ways to tell what audience at which a woodworking magazine is aimed . the first is the type of advertising , and the second is how much skill do the projects expect you to have . it is pretty clear right away that woodworker 's journal server home woodworkers who are already of moderate skill . the advertised 'big toys ' run in the 500 to 1500 dollar range , although there are a couple of high end combination machines in the adds as well . articles expect you to know how to use the tools of the trade but not sure about the 'best ' way to do something . a recent issue makes a study of an intarsia backed high chair with some interesting joinery , and instructions for making a genuinely exotic angle jig for a table saw . writing is solid and reasonably illustrated , but they devote little space to what you should already know , which can make these projects a stretch for a tyro . the magazine is very tool oriented . there is n't a lot of space devoted to hand tools or history . expect articles comparing nail guns and helping you decide whether stationary or bench top equipment is right for you . however , traditionally manual tasks like finishing also receive their due . i found the woodworker 's journal suited me quite well , and i expect to continue reading it
1	i especially love this magazine because it gives details of different `` non tourist '' adventurous things to do . either with the family or by yourself . from canoeing to climbing a mountain . i recommend it for anyone who likes the outdoors and likes to live on the edge , and with this magazine you will know what most adventure-ers dont
0	i was very disappointed with this magazine . the tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them . most articles are rather pretentious and boring . in the 5 issues i have received so far only the may 2006 issue had any thing interesting . and it only had two articles which were worth it . the first was `` robbed blind '' which was about rfid chips and the second article was `` diy ways to go green ''
1	if oprah made a magazine and it was n't that good i would still read it but luckily she writes a great magazine and it is called o. oprah helps starving kids eat and crippled kids walk and that is the kind of neat stuff she puts in her magazine . i have to hide my copies of miss whinfrey 's magazine because my brother takes them and tears them up because does not know how great a magazine it is right fellow oprah 's magaine readsers ? ? ? ! ! ! if you want to learn to be a millionairrre with pretty dogs and have lots of people come to chicago to see you you will learn how in this magazine
1	when i picked up a recent issue of natural home , i was pleasantly surprised . i enjoyed the magazine so very much ! if you get a chance to flip through it , and want validation for your salvage instincts and your love of great design ... .you may find it just as inspirational . from the article about adding pretty ( and smart ) shutters to the interior of a home for cold winter nights ( they go under the window treatment and help increase the r-ratings for insulating any window against the cold -- this technique has been used in other countries for centuries ) ; the use of ventilation and healthy air is already an obsession of mine ; and getting rid of clutter by thinking about things we own and the spaces we put them in a new way was refreshing . `` try this project '' appeals to the `` use it , do n't just throw it away ! '' girl in me . finally , designing the structure of a house around its usability is something that i really like . there is so much wasted space in today 's new construction ... i really do n't understand it . natural home challenges you to create something new out of what you already have ... a breathe of fresh air
1	i like this one better than cosmo . great info on beauty and the like
0	i subscribed to bhg from their website and ended up subscribing to an additional year . the articles are helpful to a degree but the layout of this magazine , with its overwhelming amount of advertising , takes away from any good points . i 've found the style to be choppy and very difficult to read because of the ads . it 's hard to tell how long an article is or where it starts . i rarely find anything i 'd want to save . overall a disappointment
