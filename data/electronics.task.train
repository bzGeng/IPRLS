1	i purchased the 2gb elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp sp2 with and without the most recent simpletech drivers . i do n't have another card reader for my computer , but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it 's the card reader . shortly afterwards , i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2.0 sd/mmc reader for a bit less in price than the card alone . i also noticed the atp line of 60x and 150x sd cards . i have no experience with their products , but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell . they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof . i 'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me , but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors , i will consider the atp cards in the future .
0	the alarms do n't pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications . they repeat twice and then quit . the light does n't flash except the first time . half of the time they do n't work . i sent it back for repair and they did n't do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day . same problem , it is the way it is designed but they wo n't admit it
0	this unit will not fit all lighter sockets . i 've been unable to get the unit to work at all in my wife 's saab 9-3 . the 33185 version does fit
1	this mouse has never let me down . really works on most of the surfaces
1	i purchased this remote to replace a broken tv/dvd/vcr combo remote . before buying it i checked specs of several brands and types to see if they could be programmed for my combo . this was the only one that definitely could . it has worked well ... a couple features are not available but i expect that with any replacement control . i 've also programmed it to my bose radio and my dish network box and the controls have worked just fine . now my coffee table is a lot less cluttered
0	de k0unx . i know radios . i purchased the recepter radio hd a year ago , used it for a weekend and returned it immediately . even in the denver market , with lots of very strong hd signals , this radio had trouble finding them . i 'd be listening to a strong station , and the radio would lose lock , go silent , and rebuffer before coming back to life . this was one of the few hd radios available when i bought it . i have since purchased a sangean hdr-1 and love it . read my review under the sangean hdr-1
0	after buying this product , i opened the case after few days , as i was out of country , to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices . however every time i put it in the camera or other devices , it gives error and does n't work . i could n't use this memory stick since i bought it and as i opened the box almost 15 days after the receipt , i am not sure how i can even return it back either . basically not at all happy with the product at this time
1	very pleased with the high capacity cartridge with my epson stylus cx6600 . `` compatibles '' do not compare
0	i purchased the dlo action jacket ( neoprene for 20 40gb ipods ) for my wife for use on walks , etc around town . however , the ipod does n't fit in properly . the circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod 's does n't . the plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and does n't align either so you ca n't press the play button . so , since the ipod does n't fit in the case overall , this product is useless . pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case
0	everything is fine and dandy except the fact that it does n't come with the usb cord to hook the printer to the computer , and that is a little important . also , i have windows vista , and the printer is not compatible with it , i have to download a patch , but that was my own fault . i guess you get what you pay for..
0	i 've been looking for this style of phone for a while , looks great , works great but it 's so tiny as to be a pain in the rump to use . it 's both more narrow width wise and length wise than my samsung sph-a900 . when the samsung is fully opened this is still a smaller phone . i want a small sleek mobile phone , but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home . if it we 're 1/3 larger it 'd be excellent , maybe a great phone for women . also it does not have any plugs for headsets . i am returning mine to amazon
0	you may be tempted to buy these because of the 'sony ' name ... but be warned , do not buy sony cd-r 's off of amazon ... .i bought this same 50 pack , and had to throw half , yes half as in 25 of the discs , out because they had read errors and god knows what else . i find this strange though , because i 've bought ( and still do ) these same sony cd-r 's from best buy , and at target , and at staples ... and they 've always worked fine . i thought i would give it a go buying the online and i 'm sorry i did . if you want the sony cd 's , just go to your local target and pick em up there ... at least i can tell , based off my experience , they 'll work . ca n't say the same for the ones coming from amazon
0	i was very disappointed when i received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables . cables that you can pick up at radio shack for much cheaper . just ridiculous . the airport express itself is fantastic , but skip this accessory and go to your local radio shack for the mini-rca cable , and a quick search online for the optical to mini
0	i purchased this item on 6/3/06 from amazon , and a 250gb ata/ide hitachi drive to go in it from another vendor . it all went together fine and i could mount the volume easily enough . the first thing i noticed is that it 's wi-fi would n't work with wep with my powerbook . it 'd work without encryption on the airport extreme , but not with wep or with wpa . i noted that and used it without the wi-fi for a few days . i noted it would n't hold time at all consistently . it would n't register a network time server 's data and was always in the wrong time zone , so i had to fidge by seven hours to get it to match my time , but it would still drift about ten minutes per day , and then jump an hour or two randomly , making sorting which file is the more current a bit iffy . i found it slow to mount , and it would sometimes unmount over working wep wi-fi or hardwired gigabit connections , which was disheartening . i then decided to call tech support , which is when things went from bad to worse ... calls took a minimum 25 minutes to get through initial screening to tech support staff . the tech support staff were not familiar with the product and would transfer me around , which too up to another thirty minutes . folks with extensions rarely answered or returned calls or e-mails . after *** 12 hours *** with customer support over two weeks and a not-yet-released firmware update , it would work with wpa_psk or open , but still no wep . they could n't fix the time drift issue . i repeatedly asked for a replacement , but they always had a few more hoops to make me jump through , whether it be repeating a test for the upmteenth time , or another firmware update ... they just would n't spare me the trouble and replace the unit until i was ready to scream . by this time , i was out of amazon 's return policy timeframe . they refused to give me a refund after repeated attempts . i even sent a letter , telling them to please send a refund check and not another unit or i 'd post my experience here on amazon . of course , i got a replacement unit with no other reply . now i 've got to get rid of the thing onebay or whatever , take the loss and move on . i would never buy another d-link product . i would avoid this thing like anthrax - weaponized anthrax . i bought an iomega nas unit , which works very well , has multiple drives and raid and , though it costs more , provides decent value and it works . d-link has a lot to learn about customer service and should not release beta , untested products to the consumer market . shame on them
1	these boxes are half the size of regular cases , just right -- not too bulky like the regular ones
1	my dvd player was ready to be thrown out , until i saw this product on amazon . my dvd player would n't even load a dvd . it kept saying `` please check disc '' . after loading this disc , my dvd player has worked perfectly ever since . do n't spent $ 30 on one of these `` clean up discs '' . this one does the job
0	i bought this mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the ipod and i ended up paying dearly for it . it is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months . the firmware decided to stop recognizing songs , albums titles , and eventually that there was even any music to listen to . now i have a 200 $ dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my pc . customer service ? do n't count on it . so if your into extensively troubleshooting , highly frustrating , pieces of junk , this is a great product .
0	i bought this mouse while on the road when i forgot my microsoft wireless mouse . i do not have the original packaging otherwise i would have taken in back . the usb receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back , i often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card . after a week of use the mouse started to wig-out . erratic movement etc . if the mouse is left unattended for any length of time i can not seem to wake it up with any of the buttons . the only thing that works is using the wheel to scroll . the really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until i unplug the receiver . i thought this was because i was using a mac , i experienced the same behavior on my pc as well . i 'm going to throw this away since i would not wish it on my enemy
0	the player stopped working after only a few months - it would accept dvds but not play them and refuse to eject them . that behavior started out as intermittent , but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a dvd and never let go . we had to take the player apart just to get the dvd out before throwing the player away in the trash . our previous dvd player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping . this one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether - what a waste . save your time and money and buy another machine
1	great gps unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that . clear easy to read display and instructions . menus and interface are self-intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it . no downloads , activations or learning required . satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast . accuracy is impressive with spot-on instructions and updated maps . even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled . after looking at the garmin and magellan units i thought this was the best unit for the price . it has the largest screen and the most features for this price range . a previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of bluetooth capabilities to which i completely disagree . the fact the bluetooth features are available at this price range is already impressive . also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a dashboard stand . all manufacturers seem to sell them as options ( garmin included ) .
1	i bought the 128mb card 8-9 mnths ago . at first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller ! finally it gave a 'error reading card ' message and stopped working . customer service at viking was very very helpful and prompt . they replaced the card is 7 days . they also tried to retrieve some of the images that i had considered 'lost ' in the card and sent me a cd with the images on it ! i was impressed with the excellent support , but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life . would i buy it again ? yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well
0	the new ipods do not have the connections to work with firewire . so this cable will only charge the new ipods with video . besides this this is a good product for the ipods
0	i purchased this product to share my dvi monitor and logitech bluetooth keyboard/mouse between my two main machines - the exact use promoted by the manufacturer . i successfully patched the firmware to eliminate the incessant beeping , but am extremely disappointed with the dvi video at 1600 by 1200 ( severe streaking and noise ) , and the audio is totally unuseable given the severe hum and noise . btw , i am using belkin kvm cables . do n't even think about purchasing this unit
0	i was given the ique m3 for christmas of 2005 . a few months into the new year , i dropped it onto pavement , and it broke . for $ 99 , garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit , which i consider a fair price . unfortunately , the refurb unit could n't play directions at full volume , so i returned it for another refurb . this unit fell off the windshield still in it 's cradle , and it started making that frying sound of short circuits . i called garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit , they 'd look at it under warranty . i had told the guy what happened , so i was pleasantly surprised ; they did , in fact , replace it . under all circumstances , the report you get back says the returned unit was `` within specifications '' ( or words to that effect ) , even though clearly not . i have no idea why . units will be returned with new software keys to enter , and the software will begin urging you to register , even though you already have . for some , the mapping software on the m3 will appear crippled . it is a basic drive from here to there unit . it does not allow you to load way-points , points of interest , and the like . each of the units had quirks . on the first one , every time i inserted the sd card with maps , windows player ( or whatever it 's called ) would start up and ask me if i wanted to search the card for tunes . the second one had inaudible volume . the fourth one has a problem common to the first one : the brightness resets itself randomly to zero . yep , zero . the first one left the powered brightness full on , so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on , but this one resets them both to zero . so you may think the unit is not turning on , but it 's on . you just ca n't see anything on the screen . if you 're outside , you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting , but if it 's dark , you need a flashlight . the current one will do a hard reset if i start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when i put it in the cradle . this means i have to do the full new user routine . touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen . press and hold to learn again how to copy . press and hold to learn again how to paste . reset the time from olathe , kansas , to where i live . all contacts , notes , calendars , and other information is lost . all preferences are gone . after i 've gone through the restart routine , the unit will then find the satellites and get me where i 'm going , but i ca n't load destinations from contacts , as they 're gone , so i have to type them all in by hand . if the battery runs out of juice , the unit is dead . it forgets everything , and i have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen . press and hold to learn again how to copy . press and hold to learn again how to paste . reset the time from olathe , kansas , to where i live . all contacts , notes , calendars , and other information is lost . all preferences are gone . i complained about this to support at garmin , and i was assured this is a microsoft feature and that garmin can do nothing about it . they recommended that i buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an sd card where it will not be lost . so now i carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data . i did learn , though , that if the battery runs down , the backup program is lost , so you ca n't retrieve your data from the backup sd card unless you have told the program to save as self-extracting archives . i learned it the hard way , of course . to restore , i pop out the detailed maps sd card , insert the backup card , navigate to the file explorer , navigate to the sd card , open the contents of the sd card , select the latest back up , click through the restore procedure , click to ok that it has finished ( just a minute or two with my small amount of data ) , click to restart , wait a long time for it to restart , tap to get past the owner data screen , enter the password , then pop the restore card out , reinstall the map card , wait while it reads it , then i 'm good to go . i ca n't do it while i 'm driving , of course , so if the unit resets on its own , i just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where `` home '' is , which means i have to type it or other locations into the where to dialogue . the unit defaults to 3d directions instead of north is always up , which is confusing for me as i ca n't look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where i am vis-a-vis the map . i 'm sure this is my shortcoming , and i then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up , which i ca n't do while driving . it also defaults to different displays for day and night . the night display uses a dark background , and i have found that the menus for the windows programs use a transparent background with black text . so i ca n't read the menu selections against the dark display . and the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if i lose power or the unit resets when i start the car or sometimes when i put it in the cradle . on the contacts database , the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe , kansas . it also formats all numbers as us numbers . i have a few overseas numbers , and they are crammed into the ( xxx ) xxx-xxxx format , even though they are longer and do n't start with an area code . in the calendar , if i have meetings scheduled outside my time zone , i enter them at the time they 're scheduled . then when i get there , i have the option of choosing the visited time zone , and all the times are screwed up , as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone . so i never use the visited time zone feature , and the unit assumes i 'm still in my home zone wherever i may travel . i have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address , but for which i have the lat/long coordinates . i camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads - i quickly lose where i am and have to zoom out , which loses the road . on the whole , the directions part of the m3 is excellent . it gives good directions , has reasonably up to date maps , and lets you find stores , restaurants , gas stations , hotels , and the like in your area , and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations . on the whole , using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper . after a year of use , i ca n't put up with it anymore . i 'll take garmin 's word that this is all a shortcoming of windows mobile and not garmin 's fault , but i ca n't put up with it anymore . i 'll switch to magellan or tomtom or some other unit that is n't windows-based and that does n't completely lose its mind when the battery runs down , does n't randomly do a hard reset , does n't randomly set the brightness to zero , and does n't assume all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe , kansas . maybe another manufacturer will let me import pois and way-points from other people 's files
0	sure these floppy 's are inexpensive ... they arrived on time ... thanks amazon ! ! ! ! ! but the photo does n't give it any credit ... these do n't come with a plastic carrying case like the photo ... just a crappy cardboard box ! come on guys ... .wheres the plastic case for these things , now they will be flopping all over the place in my desk drawers etc
1	i bought this 2 years back and still it is in great shape . recently i forgot compact flash in my shirt pocket and went for washing and then followed by drying . my wife found compact flash in dryer and i thought it would not work . surprisingly it is working fine and i could see my past snapshots with out any problem .
1	yes , it plays videos ( divx + windows media tested so far ) . yes , it plays and sorts your photos . yes , it plays mp3s and sorts them by their id3 tags ( artist/genre/album/etc. ) . yes , it comes with a good tv audio/video out cable ( letting you use the zen like a high-def digital video player ) . yes , you can download your compactflash card directly onto the zen hard drive . yes , it syncs with your outlook tasks and calendar . wha ? yeah . it 's hidden in there too . along with an mp3 alarm clock . if you 're going on vacation with a digital camera anytime soon , this is the multi-tool for you . leave the laptop at home . the zen has plenty of battery life and plenty of room for music , movies and photos to keep you moving for days when you 're unwired from the office
1	i have three handsets and have programmed different ring sounds for each one , e.g. , then one in my home office rings with the three stooges singing , `` hello , hello , hello ! '' phone works very well
0	it 's worth it just to take a regular size optical mouse with you . this one does n't save that much space . it works fine , but it 's not comfortable to use
0	product arrived damaged . company ( antonline ) was unwilling to exchange for new item . would never buy from them again
0	i live in washington dc , so i generally get a signal when outdoors . using these headphones did not yield an increased signal for me
1	my husband and father both have this unit . it 's really handy to have on road trips and to use while geocaching . from our experience , it does take a while to download map information onto the unit , and a color screen would be nice , but for $ 200 , i think it 's a good value
0	a nightmare ! do n't buy from electronics expo ! the 1st sharp 52 ' lcd tv was late , had a smashed hdmi 4 dead pixels . the replacement tv had even more dead pixels electronics expo , sharp , amazon visa all gave me a horrible time no respect . so i am stuck with 2 damaged tvs now still fighting for a refund . my advice to all - get a sony from a local store for perfection no worries
1	my panasonic rv31k is five years old this month and after thousands of hours playing movies it works just as well today as when i first took it out of the box . panasonic makes quality products and just like anything else mechanical you can get a lemon . if this player ever dies ( cross my fingers ) i will get another panasonic . i choose mine after reading all of the reviews here and in epinions.co
1	these batteries last a long time . cheaper batteries wo n't hold a charge after repeated use/charging . i have aa energizer batteries and after a year they still hold a charge with out any problems .
0	i ordered the cobra hg a1500 high gear cb antenna . they keep sending the cobra hg a1000 . now i 'm stuck with a antenna i did not order nor do i want .
1	they say it 's quiet , and it holds tons of data . they were correct . fast access speed , easy installation , an overall fine product . have not used the feature that let 's you back-up your entire drive , but we use it in our lan for shared files , and it 's comforting to know that we 've got these files stored redundantly . this box does just what it claims to do , the warranty of merchantability ( from my old law class ! ) .
1	this unit is battery powered and mine arrived with a dead battery , however , replacing that was quick and easy although irritating . after installation and use for a while , i noticed the unit also got rid of some direct dialed calls as well as computer generated calls . if you do n't speak immediately after pickup , the telemarketer hears the tone and hangs up ! great item..
1	i have n't had any problems using this dvd/cd burner over firewire on a g4 imac running mac osx tiger . in fact , setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual ; it was truly plug-and-play . minor quibbles : the open/close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended , the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case , and only the lite version of toast 6 is included . bottom line : i would buy this burner again , given my experiences using it
0	purchased for my daughter , an english teacher , scrabble lover . she said she 'd rather have a book to look up words and most of the features on the franklin she 'd never use and thought they took away from the mental challenge of the game . she said it would end up on a shelf in her house . she 'd rather have a paperback scrabble dictionary . i returned the franklin . she did n't even like the idea of taking it to school for her kids to use when she lets them play scrabble in class
1	i recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office . the reception on this unit is great . bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations . the sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in . if you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound .
0	i 'm a gamer . i play for hours a day and currently use a simple ms intellimouse optical . well i was looking for something a little more pro , and in my searching i saw the razer line of gaming mice . i uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out , only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with . it 's got large rubber triming down each side , so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons . i only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will never , ever , be able to reach them during game play . it also feels too long and flat , so the scroll wheel is note easily reached , and your hand does not rest comfortably . yeah , it looks great , and i 'm sure it 's doing an amazing job a moving precisely . however , i ca n't get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape , so for gaming , it 's rather worthless .
1	the one in our bedroom would n't always work , could n't hear the kids calling . i was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice . both my dell charger and thinkpad charger had the same effect , even without the laptop plugged into the charger . if your having problems , i would start with unplugging other things first . overall , these have been a godsend , wife no longer has to scream at the kids across the entire house . used to drive me crazy
0	very simply put , the sound is wonderful - the design stinks . i too crazy glued the rubber earcups to the plastic earphones - that lasted 2 days and they fell off . i do n't know what bose is thinking - clearly they are not doing any end-user testing . update - bose has issued replacement earcups which apparently do n't fall off . pretty cool - i got ta upgrade my rating from 2 to
0	do n't believe the claim that you can `` just plug it in and it 's ready to use . '' this product is set up for windows , and the instructions for installing the drive for a mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the windows software . it 's easy to become hopelessly fouled up . do n't expect any help from western digital . if you can actually get connected to them , and your call is n't dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so , you 'll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive . their web site help is equally useless
0	do not order this item and expect to get what you see . i ordered the super high speed card ( rpsdh01gu1a ) and what i got was a low quality high speed card ( rpsdk01gu1a ) . seems to be some kind of a scam that ritz is running with amazon 's blessing . buyer beware . this has happened to me before when you order from one of amazon 's partners , and amazon will do nothing to help you
1	the only reason i did n't give this item 5 stars is because i have only taken it on the road once , so as of yet i ca n't call it a worthy 'road warrior . ' however , it is certainly a great case . proportioned well and good design , with space for essentials . would recommend for anyone looking for a good case for their 17 '' widescreen notebook
1	the design for this headset is ingenious . every piece is separated so you can mix and match for your convenience . it 's not really a headset , but a headphone with a detachable headset ; so you can use it to chat online or listen to your mp3 player . the microphone can even be mounted independently onto your computer monitor with the included base . the extension cord comes with a volume controller , another very convenient feature . there are also little hangers on the extension cord , which are for attaching the microphone cord . the audio quality is pretty good , throw in 20 bucks more to get the combo set , which includes a sound card to enhance the audio quality . ****the only thing i have to complain about is the comfort issue . maybe it 's the size of my head , but the earpieces simply press a little bit too hard against my temples , so it causes mild headache after 30 minutes of usage . other than that , this headset is perfect
0	i purchased this battery as a replacement for the original battery in my cordless telephone . although i fully charged the battery upon arrival , it will not hold a charge for more than 24 hours . i would not purchase this battery again
1	i have both the 4 port and 2 port versions of these and they seem to work well with my dell optiplex 260 running windows xp . my poweredge 500sc , 1400 , and 1800 tend to lose the mouse and keyboard and have to be rebooted , but this may be a function of running windows 2003 r2 on them . also , the 1800 has a promise sata card which locks up with usb in general making this switch a problem ( i had to go back to the ps2 kvm ) . but with xp machines it seems fine
0	i purchased this printer for it 's fast printing speed and long life in toner and drum , but it 's really been a let down . the printer has this habit of creasing and wrinkling the paper on the first 2 pages of every print out . so now i have to send 3 copies of everything i want to the printer , wasting paper and ink . i 've tried different kinds of paper , and every troubleshooting option offered to me by the fine folks at brother , but it continues to do this . i 've looked around the internet , and found this is a common defect in the 5240 and 5250 models . it 's really an inconvenience , and now i have to purchase a new printer because it 's such a pain . if you love to be frustrated and angered over print quality and paper use , this is the printer for you . otherwise , avoid at all costs
1	i bought this because i did not want to mount my garmin 350 nuvi to the windshield . this device makes is much easier to switch the unit to different cars . i drove normally and the unit did not slide around on my dashboard . i can also mount the unit on a center console and it works there too . please note that this is a complete unit for portable mounting and it is much cheaper than buying the sandbag mounting arm separately
0	i find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable . i would rate the product a zero if it were an option . i ca n't even use them because they 're too uncomfortable to wear . not worth the money , even though they 're cheap
0	nice product before they decided to save a few pennies - i have purchased seven , but now it is made with out the handle - so if that was part of the atraction of this case , note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle ' -- not ! 5 stars if it still had the handle or if you do n't need one
0	the range on this product is no where near what was advertised . i purchased ( 2 ) units and neither will work consistently beyond 4-5 feet from mac . attempted to improve operation by relocating mac , using usb extension cable , and changing id on transmitter with no improvement . extremely disappointed
0	i bought this cable to connect 50 '' plasma tv to computer . when we connected the cable with tv we could not get it to display computer screen . we spent 2 hours with plasma manufacturer on telephone troubleshooting the connection . at the end , at our dissapointment , we found out that the cable was defective . when we tried different cable everything worked
0	i purchased this mouse 5 months ago and it has been total frustration ever since . the buttons on the sides are not easy to access or use . but most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform . when i clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages . i know some may be thinking i have n't configured the settings correctly but i went over it several times and could n't get it to work right . what 's even more frustrating is the support at razer is non-existent . they never responded to my email questions which i submitted several times before giving up . i ended up buying a wacom intuos 3 tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more . i am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse/pen tool for my needs . do n't buy this product . i would have given it a negative 5 stars if that were an option . at $ 43.65 , it 's a steep price to pay for the frustration and a complete waste of time and money
0	i just purchased this item - now i 'm planning to return it tomorrow . one of the advertised features , the ability to store liner notes just does n't work properly . they just do n't into the pocket without bending and/or forcing them in . to me , the liner notes have value and i 'm not willing to fold , spindle , or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
1	i own the hp 475 and since it 's slightly larger then the rest , the printer barely fits in the case . it does fit but it is very tight . i would not recommend this for the 475 . probably i should n't have bought this but i really liked the case
0	we bought this phone two years ago . while the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features ( i 've especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets ) , we 've found it to be extremely unreliable . the problems we 've had are listed below : *very short battery life for the handsets *the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use *the handsets go `` out of range '' when one takes them only a modest distance from the base ( even though we have the base in the middle of our house , the handsets do n't work at the ends -- and our house is not that big ) *the handsets randomly become `` unregistered '' from the base and have to be reset ( this has only become a problem in the past month ) the issues we 've had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone -- usually we 'd expect such a purchase to last longer than two years
0	after few months it just stopped working . also , it is not rechargable , and need to replace batery every 1-2 week
0	i got this and installed it . it ca n't read cds or dvds . it ca n't write cds . it can only write dvds
1	the thing that seperates this dvd case from the rest is it 's center lock design . it 's secures the disc nicely without damaging it ... like i have had others do . worth the extra dough to have a quality product . ( now if only their memorex 's software was as good !
1	after reading several reviews on portable speakers , i decided to purchase the sonic impact i-f2 for my ipod . it has great sound quality , the case is durable , it packs away easily and you can take it anywhere . you can listen to music while its charging and the sounds system is quite attractive . this is by far the best accessory i 've purchased for my ipod . did i mention that it has a remote control ! !
1	la instalación del producto fue bastante simple , la configuracion y operacion tambien los son , solo he observado un problema con el control remoto , en ocasiones deja de funcionar , no controla el volumen ni cambia los caneles de cable , solo despues de oprimir el boton de apagado y luego de vilver a activarlo es que regresa la funcionalidad de los botones de control de volumen y selector de canales ; otra observacion en el funcionamiento es que al seleccionar en forma progresiva canales estos saltan al siguiente
1	a great and economical replacement ! this product saved me a lot of money . the red in the color leaked a tiny bit in shipment but cleaned up and worked with no problem
0	completely useless . only shows a digital display when ipod is `` fully charged '' -- how long does your ipod stay fully charged ? even when showing digital display does n't actually broadcast . maxell replaced it with the p-4a for a reason . amazon should n't even be selling this , it makes me distrust amazon . i got it as a christmas present but it was bought in october so they wo n't even take it back . follow up : after i emailed amazon , they issued a complete refund , which they refused to do over the phone . now they just need to pull the product , since they ( probably wisely ) are n't carrying the p-4a and therefore ca n't recommend it as an option .
1	the other effusive reviews are spot-on ... the picture is fabulous on new dvds ( lord of the rings , nemo , harry potter ) . a $ 20 cables to go hdmi cable does a great job . we have the sony kdf-42e2000 42 '' 3lcd rear projection hdtv and are thrilled with the combination . a few annoyances : the machine responds and loads slowly , but that 's not too bad ; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price . and , certain dvds of old movies ( some like it hot , the king and i ) stretch the picture horizontally , making things look squat . i 'm sure there 's a solution , but just ca n't figure it out . any tips
1	quick reader , poor design . it does a great job copying images to my mac , but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo-poo . it stays on tight , which is good , until you try to open it . the force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball-groove hinges useless . it 's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off , leaving the reader exposed to the elements
0	i was happy with the noise canceling features , not the best but definitely works . great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise . my problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by targus ( cheers to them ) . the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just is n't very sturdy . i 'm gentle with my stuff too , so either i had bad luck w/two defective units or they 're just not made well
0	not at all what i wanted . it is a plastic slip on that pushes the buttons when you do n't want them pushed . ordered 2 and plan to return them . i usually do n't even bother to write a bad review ; i just do n't write one , but in this case i 'll make an exception . yuk ! actually , i rate it at a `` 0 '' but there was no `` 0 '' selection .
1	i bought this for my new sony ericson w300i phone so that i could actually put some music on the phone . it came with a ms pro adapter which is nice because i have a slot on my computer for that . it is fast and just what i wanted
1	i bought one for a relative last christmas . saw how convenient and easy it was to program . so i bought one for myself this march . it works just great . the setup software programs the 670 easily and the logitech remote replaces the remotes for a hdtv , a dvd home theater a/v receiver , a dishhd dvr receiver , and a psyclone psc01 source selector . one button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity . i like the color screens and icons on the higher end logitech remotes .. but the discrete placement of buttons on the 670 is much more practical for me to use . function wins forms this time round . all is not rosy though . added the sony ps3 to the entertainment arena . the bluetooth requirements of the ps3 leaves it out of the ir rf remotes inner circle . consider this if you need a combined solution for infra red rf as well as bluetooth devices . ( the sony ps3 is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case ) . fully backlit is a signifcant bonus..none of the replaced remotes had adequate backlit features . short version : this cool tool really works and should satisfy most . think `` out of the box '' though if you have a sony ps3 tied into your entertainment network . ..click
0	this was the worst electronics puchase i 've ever made . when i first got the mini it was great , looked nice and sounded great . within about 6 months battery life started to go way down , after a year it was down to nothing , did n't work properly , would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes . if you 're going to take a chance on an ipod , definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one
1	a very good product , but the fantastic part is sirius radio itself . howard rules !
1	i received my kingston 256mb sd card just as advertised . the unit came in the mail exactly 2 days after i ordered . worked perfectly and i 'm very satisfied
1	just my two cents , i bought these from the sony store for $ 15 bucks two years ago , they 've lasted me this long for light office use , so at $ 7/year , this seems to be a good budget earphones . i 'm not an audiophile , so i do n't need expensive earphones . however they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack , the wires got loose and the sound just stopped . moral of the story : do n't twist or touch the wires/cable . pros : lightweight , budget-oriented , comfortable fit for my ears cons : eventually broke , cheap earphone covers will get lost easil
1	i travel overseas a lot for my job . this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your `` normal '' plugs for operating four devices . most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money ( wires , cables , etc . ) but this gizmo rocks
1	great product but is only $ 30 at iriver.com 's stor
1	i have this console for protection of master bedroom 40 '' lcd samsung 1080p hdtv and denon surrond sound 7.1 home theater system . i have been very pleased with the improved picture and sound . before hooking up to this console , i had a slight wave going across the screen . it is now gone as is the slight buzz from the sound system . i also have 1-2 power outages every month from new construction in our area . the console has protected all of the equipment very well . considering the price and free shipping through amazon , i highly recommend this console
1	i got this on sale for $ 80 and i love it . it holds about 300 songs , gets plenty loud , has amazingly good battery life , and takes all my abuse . i play it at least 2 hours a night , if not all night , its my alarm in the morning , i listen to it in the car , on the bus , before school , during lunch , ok how bout his i use it a ton . i never leave home without it its small , easy and comfortable to hold , and it wont die if you drop it . wiht my previous player i had an issue with it erasing all the songs and i know other people who have had that issue with other players but this one has n't let me down yet . o one big plus the battery back is attached so it will never dissapear
1	it worked much better than expected . the page clips also were very good , but one fell off about 5 minutes into owning/using the item ( i put it back on , but fell off a couple more times ) . i also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well .
1	i must admit , the first review posted here on the d320 made me a little nervous . my experience is quite different , and after several months of ownership i am quite pleased . i 'll give a point by point rebuttle to the initial review , as that 's the only point of reference ( so far ) : 1 ) yes , pick up a usb cable , 2 ) printer driver installation on win98 essentially required no user intervention . with winxp however , i do seem to recall having to muck with it more , but i 'm hazy on the details now , 3 ) i have printed scores of multi-page documents , many over 15 pages without any problems whatsoever . i 've had no spills or jams of any kind , 4 ) i have not seen any `` paper-curl '' problems whatsoever , 5 ) i leave the paper cassette lid/manual-feed slot in place at all times as i have no problem with it . for doing many two-sided copies , it is indeed easier to place the copies back into the paper cassette . but that 's my experience with any copier i 've used . 6 ) making two-sided copies is easy and as efficient as i expected . i 've simply experienced no problems . 7 ) i 've experienced no copier caused misalignments . if my copies have been crooked , it was because i set them on the glass improperly . i am very happy with this unit . it copies as i expect it to , and prints just the same : quickly and without event . it 's been able to properly print from all windoze applications i 've thrown at it , and ones many users may not even be using , such as ghostscript , acrobat , securecrt , paf , and all image viewing software i 've tried . and i 've got several machines networked together ( win98 and winxp ) that can all print to the d320 fine using printer sharing . btw , the d320 comes with a full , 3500 page toner cartridge too , not a starter unit as with some printers/copiers
1	i received this printer a few days ago and i am very impressed . 4 x 6 photos look awesome as if i had walmart print them and the speed is very fast . i hook it up to my airport extreme base station ( i use a powerbook ) and print wirelessly and had no problems at all . scanner is a tad bit noisy but a lot quieter than my old hp all in one printer that just kicked the bucket . the software is easy to use and understand . i never read the directions and i was scanning in pictures with in minutes . i also like the lcd display on the printer . its nice to just `` pop '' in a memory card , and view the photos you want to print . it saves time when you do n't have to download them to the computer then print them . overall i am vey pleased and i did my search on this printer and all of the reviews were very good . i was torn between canon ( i actually bought a canon pixma and returned it ) and hp and i am glad i stuck with hp , always a trusted brand . and the price was about $ 40.00 dollars cheaper than any electronics store around . pros : excellent picture qualty fast printing easy setup a lot of features easy to use and understand functions cons : scanner a litte noisy ( quieter than my old hp ) when printing the printer shakes my table ( old hp did the same ) i guess it is a little on the large side , but it does n't bother m
1	i had two unworking disks ( one a ps2 game and the other a psx game ) so i picked this up and both work fine now ! the only thing is you 'll have to run it through a couple times . if you run it through once you 'll see little difference ... but for the price and since it does work ... eventually , i still give it a 5 out of 5 .
0	the item was not difficult to install but the adaptor plate did not fit my tv so i called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks . i was disappointed it was not as universal as advertised . once i got the tv up it is ok , and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person job and it takes two to lift it up as it should for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steady . i did find out there is another one that could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks . i had to return the first tv to the store and round up help when i got a replacement . now it looks like i may need to do that again as the replacement tv has problems also.this whole thing with the mount and tv has been very frustrating . mike d. live and learn
1	my company purchased two of these phone a month or two back for office use . previously we had an at - which i 'll probably never own again after having a panasonic . the phones have great voice quality - plus some nice features you do n't always find , like the hold option , data port on the back , and a nice lcd screen displaying date , time , # missed calls , # messages , and in call timer . i do wish , however , that the lcd was backlit . another great feature is the fact that it displays the associated caller id stamp with the message that is playing - no more guessing who left the message when ! the phones have been standing up beyond our expectations - and i plan on buying panasonic phones our next time around
1	i have been using this mouse at work since it came out . after many miles of use , the scroll wheel has finally started to fail . i can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls . the best feature of this mouse is the battery life . a coworker who swears by his logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months , but i usually got at least ten months out of mine . i even took to dating the batteries when i installed them , just to rub it in . this mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some , but overall i would recommend it . going to try a rechargable logitech next time around
0	do not buy this unit . i have tested the vosky , iogear and now us robotics and they are all junk . while the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate . i do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit . and why are the so small ! ? the are so small as to be practically useless . the iogear unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons . bottom line : wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a polycom and the computer calling kit that is available through polycom . ( even the polycom computer calling kit is analog ! what is the problem ! ?
1	this bag is just pefect ! i purchased it for my dell inspiron 6400 and , although the fit was pretty snug , i am very pleased with the purchase . it is easy to carry and above everything else , is very stylish and professional .
0	the only good thing i can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works . but ... software installation is long and tedious ( and took three times on one laptop to get to work ) . installed drivers cause my pc to take 45+ seconds longer to boot and sometimes ( about 30 % ) stop the shut-down sequence ( i have to click `` end '' in a dialogue box ) . the ink runs out ( even the big black one ) amazingly quickly and replacements are $ 54 at costco . it seems you got ta get only hp cartridges , as third-party cartridges fail . i 'll never buy another hp printer
0	i bought these headphones as a replacement for my second pair of blown ipod earbuds , hoping to get stronger bass and better sound isolation . i got both . unfortunately , the sound coming out of these headphones is extremely muddy and overly bass-heavy . furthermore , they were quite painful in my ears the first several times i wore them and the mini-jack has a poor connection , often leaving me without sound in one ear . do yourself a favor and spend the money to get a quality pair of headphones , particularly if you 're looking to buy in-ear headphones .
1	i bought this card to be used with an ipaq hw6945 it has enough capacity for gps maps , programs and some music a 4 gb one would be great but it seems there is no 4gb card from sandisk that is supported by the ipaq . the reading / writing speed is ok too . very good product for only 18 bucks
1	elegant design , sturdy construction . supports my yamaha sy35 securely . after reading the forbidding reviews i decided to assemble it without first reading the directions . it took me 10 min
0	i have bought and returned three of these units now . each one has been defective , and finally i just gave up on returning the system . the dvd player constantly gives `` bad disc '' errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc . the sound quality is very nice for the price , but since the player does n't work , it 's essentially useless . this is a complete rip-off at any price point
0	how do i assign a rating ? as several other people have experienced , my unit is also doa . i received it , plugged it in , pressed 'clean ' , and the motor started up . i popped open the cover , put in the disc i wanted cleaned , and pressed 'clean ' again . nothing . terrible quality control . what 's worse is the unit case is glued together -- no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty
0	this product is a sad joke . it 's expensive of course . the paper is just heavyweight paper that 's perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves ... which takes some effort ( not sure if it 'd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board ) . but , whatever . however , the software is crap . that 's the appropriate term . reading this i can save you an hour of your precious time . no you ca n't make the template show right-side up . that 's right ... to use the software you have to tilt your head sideways . i 'm not kidding ! i guess you could also turn your monitor on it 's side . you can rotate the text so it shows the way it should . but when you edit it , it 'll be sideways again . so you 'll have to turn your head ( or monitor ) back and forth sideways . what kind of company would sell such a product ? and oh yeah ... if you 're looking for templates for the dvd inserts ? ... nada . they 're not there !
1	came quickly and was exactly as offered . i am completly satisfie
0	returned it . would n't work with vista and a canon mp780 and it certainly wo n't work with mac os x clients ( note : the product does n't advertise support for mac ) . why is it so difficult for manufacturers to create a wireless print server that works with multifunction printers
0	i 'm sure it would work well somewhere , just not for our small business . i put it behind an adsl router and used it to authenticate pppoe . it was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was , it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected . after hours on the phone with tech support from linksys and the dsl router people , nobody could help . while it connected , it did work very well , it just did stay up . too bad
0	this item is absolutely worthless , do n't waste your time ! i 'm returning mine to target tomorrow . there are laws against false advertising , i do n't know why they 're not enforced . i will never buy anything made by belkin again .
0	the apple remote is included with the imac g5 and works great with it and front row . however , for the ipod , it 's almost useless . the lack of menu navigation capability using the remote is crippling . in short , do n't buy this remote , look at other non-apple remotes that are more full-featured
0	i read the other reviews , some glowing , others well.. not so glowing . the price was right , ( $ 149 - 50 rebate ) so i thought i would take a chance . i read the other reviews so i have no one else to blame but myself . first off , i am only interested in playing videos from my computer , so i have no idea how well the image viewing or mp3 playing works . i also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections . my house is fully wired with cat5 , therefore i am using this product wired , not wireless . i was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton ... so far so good . the first thing i did was check for updates . an update was found and updated successfully . i then had the dsm-320 look for media servers . it found the tversity server right away and i was able to see the contents listed . this unfortunately is the end of the good news . it 's all went downhill from here . 1 . neither server , tversity or the dlink were smart enough to view a folder of vob files as a movie . they listed them as vob_1 , vob2 etc . so for example , i clicked on my casablanca folder , i would then need to click on vob_1 to start the movie . when vob_1 ended after about 20 minutes , it did not go to vob_2 . i needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play . arrrgghh ! ! p.o.s . thing . 2 . as another review stated , the ff simply does not work properly . oh , sure if you press ff the movie will fast forward . but there is no way to stop it . if you press play while the movie is ff'wding , the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current vob . more , arrrrgghh ! this alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device . which i will be doing first thing in the morning . my final advice to any prospective buyers : s t a y a w a y ! ! ! ! my final advic to d-link , great idea , but your product absolutely sucks . oh one more thing , someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly . yes the two ladies i spoke to were both very friendly , their english was terrible . ( guess which county you call for tech support ... oh come on , just one guess ) it also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another . i could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients . which made it very difficult for the lady helping me . she needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over . sheesh , i must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right . one last interesting tidbit , on the packaging , they mention nero recode ce . so i went to the nero site to check it out . nero has a list of supported media players listed . and you know what , d-link is not one of them . i will return this d-link junk and purchase one the nero certified product instead . i bow my head in shame , as i had read the reviews but i bought the product anyway .
1	this product with the assoicated software ( included ) is everything you hope it is but really do n't believe it will be . the x-ray glasses you saw advertized in the back of the comic book when you were a kid cost you $ 1.50 to learn a lesson why you should be skeptical . the garmin is the real deal . i bought it for my son ( a high school state ( indiana ) level miler ) . when he took off for his first workout and got home an hour later , he uploaded his entire workout onto the computer and low and behold his whole course with speeds , times , street names , etc. , showed up on our computer , starting with the satallite photograph of our patio ! ! ! !
0	a clock radio that you have to fumble for a remote to use ... .i do n't think so . i have the older models ( cd clock radio ) and they are nice but the new model is irritating . i also have the ipod player and at least the volume controls are on the system . i ca n't keep a system that i have to locate a remote to operate .
0	i value the amazon product reviews and have purchased many items based on customer feedback . i purchased this phone from home depot for $ 69.95 . i am returning it today . it is to large for comfort , the reception is bad , the letters too small for those of us who need reading glasses ... i could go on
1	i 've had this phone less than a week , but i have been pleased with it 's performance so far . the set up was somewhat tricky , as many , if not all skype addresses use a period in the address . none of the literature showed how to find the period . by accident i noticed it was available on the 1 button . after discovering that , the installation went flawlessly . if one is already familiar with the use of the alpha/numeric keypad , one would have no problems . if one is learning on this phone with the literature provided , one needs help . the phone has worked well with both the landline , and the skypeout alternatives . i 'm pleased enough that i 'm buying two more as the equipment will accomodate up to four phones .
1	this is a great card reader for the price . why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have ? personally , i only use compactflash and sd cards . it reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably . the shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards , which you 'll want to do a bit carefully . it would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk . remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the sandisk logo on the card reader . it is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first , but once you get the feel of it , it beccomes quite easy and routine . this sandisk has led indicators that are helpful . one amber led to tell you the unit is connected to your usb , and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert ( solid green ) , or that it 's reading or writing ( blinking green ) . this card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and i feel it represents a good value . i would recommend it
1	i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play . i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it . it 's the best-feeling keyboard i 've ever owned . the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate , and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature . the backlighting is bright , day or night , and the programmable g-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past . highly recommended
1	this memory card reader worked like a charm for me . we 've used both sd and sony memory sticks in it with absolutely no problems
1	i received a pleasent surprise . the keyboard was shipped sooner than i expected , arrived in perfect condition and works beautifully . i will buy from this vendor again
1	i love the feel of this gamepad ... after trying several others this is the best . the wireless works ok , i was 20 feet away and it was working.the batteries are what needs improving according to many posts . i thought i had a dead battery but it ended up being a bad connection inside . with a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the battery case . on the positive side of each battery there are two small pieces of plastic . you just need to push these down so the battery has a better chance of connectiing . i also found new batteris at interstate battery store , 1 dollar each . the analog sticks could be a little tighter , but i like the d pad . wireless is great
0	worked great for about a week , then i seemed to get an average of 12 telemarketing calls a da
0	i purchased this from amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included . however when it arrived , there was no battery . upon questioning amazon about the battery , the customer service rep said he could give me a $ 5 credit for the batteries . i asked how the battery could only be worth $ 5 . he said that is what aa rechargeable batteries go for . the bag is ok , but do n't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers
1	length of ownership : 8 weeks this puppy really reaches out . my laptop 's internal intel/pro wireless sees about 6 networks but with the hawking dish a typical haul is 20 networks . thanks to some friendly neighbors i 've said goodbye to my paid isp and now enjoy casual and free internet connections , and until metrofi completes its set up of free city-wide wifi i 'll get by with that thanks to this neat hawking device . unless i need the next and more expensive step up for such wifi booster devices i hope the hawking dish proves durable..after all it 's been just 2 months of ownership so far , albeit good ones . note : for me this device has not seemed very directional in that it will pick up off-beam signals fairly well . also , placement by a window will help your reception
1	umm . this is ink . not much to say other than it works fine with my epson r320 printer
1	this is a great product for a busy professional or grad student who gives their mac a lot of mileage . i 'm in law school , so i 'm constantly throwing my computer in my bag along with heavy casebooks , keys , and other junk . my old ibook survived tremendous abuse , and after two years looked like it had been through a war . the speck case protects the macbook 's shell and even the screen , in a roundabout way . normally , if you put a mac into a briefcase or bag with heavy books , the books will press against the shell , and the screen inside will press against the keys leaving dents and screwing the the lcd . the speck case is very stiff , so even the heaviest books and the worst abuse do n't push the screen onto the keyboard . plus , if you put a red case on a white mac , people will think you 're in some secret club that has access to red macs . cons : it 's next to impossible to remove the top case with two hands - you need a buddy to get it off . also , dust starts to collect under the bottom case ( static ? ) , so you need to take off the bottom monthly to clean . fortunately the bottom case is easier to remove for cleaning .
0	i bought my wife a nuvi 350 for her birthday last august ( overall , we love the nuvi , but the mount ... no ) . the biggest `` advantage '' of the nuvi over other gps systems is its portability . unfortunately , the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature . the cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well ... and then wo n't let go . when we tried to transfer it ( after being attached only a couple of days ) , it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield ( though with difficulty and repeated tries , we have been able to move it ) . what this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in . the mount and the charging/power wire ( which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount ) are pretty darn expensive ( $ 60-70 ) which is ridiculous for a `` portable '' system
1	as homeschoolers , we were in search for a laminator that could help us preserve the various documents we woul be using year in and year out . the quikfinish plh4100 10 '' laminator has done an exceptional job . easy to use , as my wife had it out of the box and using it within minutes
1	i took my mp3 player into the store with me to check out earbuds . eveyone i tried was terrible ; so i ended up buying online . i read all the reviews , especially amazon reviews ; because the people know what they are talking about . i have bought 5 pair altogether for friends , and they love these buds too . the music i listen to ranges from tupac to vivaldi , and everything in between . my mp3 player has 9 eq settings ; i keep it on new age most of the time . the price is right , and the sound is the best .
1	i want the dvds i 'm making to last to as close to forever as possible , so i did a lot of research before deciding what dvds to buy . verbatim came out as # 1 for durability . i chose the dvd-r format for maximum compatibility with various devices . and i 've only had a few errors after burning about 75 dvds . amazon 's sale price for these was great . if you 're just looking for short-term backup media , i 'm sure you can find cheaper , but these are a different class of dvds
0	it was very bright at first . then button began malfunctioning . i emailed customer service and never heard back . do n't know if it was a problem with my unit or a poor quality button
1	very good quality sound , loud ring , substantial weight ( not all cheap plastic with no heft ) . only con is that even on `` low '' the ringer is very loud
1	these speakers can almost hit any range of sound , but if anything they are a little weak on the bass side . they put out very crisp sound for my system . you might want to add a sub to them for complete range sound
0	this is a recorder with many nice features but mine lasted only a few dozen hours ( but did make it beyond the very short warrenty ) . it was well cared for and still does not have even the tiniest scratch but it simply did not last long . for the price i expected a durable and well built machine . i was very disappointed and could not personally recommend it
0	i put this cover on immediately after i opened my ipod after reading how easy they are to scratch . i 've never had my ipod without the cover on it and have had it 3 weeks . i now have an ipod covered with distracting scratches on the screen . save your money . this case is junk
1	i needed a sub for my garage , and did not want to spend more than $ 200 . got it on sale for well under that . since this was just for the garage , when tinkering with my bikes , i did n't want something too expensive , and did n't expect much from such a small sub . i was very pleasantly suprised by it 's performance , this thing will rock when needed , and hits suprisingly low for a small sub in a very large space . i first tried a polk psw10 , since polk products had never dissapointed me in the past . well there is always a first time ... the yamaha smokes the polk sub , i returned the polk immediatly . of couse it does n't compare with the energy s12.3 i use in my main music system , but for 1/5 the cost , i never expected it to
0	i have returned this item to amazon ; i paid $ 43.99 when they had it in stock . the audio out on this dock is a stereo mini ( 1/8 '' ) jack , the connection is terrible from then getgo , with low volume , distortion , and noise when the jack is jiggled . i would highly recommend the dock they 're currently selling at radio shack for $ 29.99 . it has rca outputs on the back and excellent sound quality , it charges , and the remote has a menu button
1	i had researched for a long time before i finally made my purchase . the final reasons for this purchase was the consumer reports best buy recommendation for the larger 42 '' version of this olevia set . i had debated about purchasing a tv with 1080 but decided against doing so when i read that in a set this size that the naked eye could not tell the difference between 1080 and 720 . i needed the 37 '' set due to the entertainment center we already owned , which cost 2.5 times the price of the tv , so it was n't leaving the house . the tv opening would have allowed a 40 '' but i am glad i stayed with the 37 '' because the set-up would have been difficult if not impossible with a 40 '' because of the need to turn the set at angles . i compared the two tvs at the olevia site and the only difference was the speakers . i also saw the olevia at a friend 's house and was impressed with the quality . the best price was found through amazon.com . i placed my order on a friday evening and the set was delivered by ups in perfect condition on wednesday . the set-up of the tv was simple . the only problem i experienced was with the remote . here 's the good news : i sent an email to tech support and quickly i had an answer that was simple to follow and the remote worked perfectly the same evening that i set-up the tv . even though i use the surround sound through our stereo , i actually was satisfied with the sound through the tv speakers . a small problem is that the time warner cable box remote control does not operate the tv , so we do have to use multiple remotes , but that 's only a minor inconvenience . our family has been very pleased with the tv . i would highly recommend this tv to anyone purchasing this size tv .
1	after reading several reviews on this unit , we purchased it . the majority of our equipment supported gigabit and so we decided it was time to `` get in the game '' . it took less then 15 minutes to install in our rack and change over to it . all i can say is `` wow '' ! the performance is phenomenal . we have had no issue with it since switching over and it just plain works . i can not believe that we can obtain that level of speed in network applications for the price we paid . highly recommended
1	great product . totally eliminates the need to constantly change frequencies in urban areas
1	i was programming an ipod for a friend and became interested in buying one for myself . i went to the store to get some info on the ipod , and luckily the departments store i frequent did n't carry the unit , but offered the zune . i came straight home , did my reasearch , and ordered on the same day . the zune is far more superior than any ipod model that i have either read about or experienced for myself . and a much better deal moneywise . i must say that you should n't get a zune unless you are running a windows version with sp2 or higher , for any other ver . wo n't recognize the unit . i had a pc w/sp1 and media center 2002 , so i thought i was in trouble . against my initial thoughts on sp2 , i went ahead and upgraded , and have n't had any problems yet . the sound is great , videos are decent , and the software is very user friendly . i would check out the other models of media players , especially the archos brand , for they have a bigger screen and hard drive . but for audio and a few videos , this unit is worth the money
0	i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company , plus i liked the look of it . but after just 5 months after purchase , and not even using it that often , it has already broken . i paid about 40 dollars for this cd player , so i am very disappointed . if i were you , i would buy a different cd player
1	i also purchased this product because of the quality of the receiver made by sony . this 7.1 channel home theater with hdmi passthrough is a great machine that money can buy . if you are looking for quality , surround sound in your livingroom , or your own home theater , this s the product you should invest in . this is a great investment for me . i am glad i found it in amazon
1	this is a great little power strip that allows me to maximize the contents of my briefcase . one of the most useful things i have ever bought for business travelling . very well made . i would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive
0	i 've had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light . so i was happy to find this one . however , with my first `` eagle '' the alarm did n't go off . amazon was great about the exchange for a new one ( kudos ) . my repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight wo n't light up and i have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on . i second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle . the loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning , but i put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough .
1	i recently bought and installed this radio in my truck , and i have not had any problems yet ! ! ! a few minor details are the noise blanker seems really sesitive ( sometimes when it is on i do not receive any traffic ) but that is about it . i enjoy cobra products , this is my second radio ( i just traded up from a 25nwxt ) , i have a cobra hg2000 antenna , and i am waiting on a cobra mic for my radio . so far no problems with any of it and i hope to have none down the road ! ! ! !
1	i recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but i was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg . it was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers . she seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents . the only real problem that i had with is that it costed less a few days after i purchased it . but that 's really a personal problem
0	we used the cd player one time . the next time we attempted to use it , it would not play the cd . we ended up having to return it because it was defective
0	the software to this mp3 player made it too much work . anything that freezes up my computer has to go . here 's my experience . i purchased this player on february 23rd and returned it to the store on march 8th . i was somewhat apprehensive from the beginning about the software but decided to give it a try . i installed the software with no problem , but found the media player to be cumbersome compared to other media players . i just did n't like the look of it or how it categorized the music files . i did download some music and other audio files and the player worked just fine . it had a very nice sound , easy to use and wonderful to carry around . i listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge . fast foward week 2 i wanted to delete some files and add some new ones . i opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as i did at first . first , the program began running really slow and then froze . i ctr/alt delete and started over . it worked for a second and then froze again . i rebooted and it did the same thing . i came back to it the next day and it did it again . i uninstalled it ( so i thought ) , and it continued to freeze . it does n't completely uninstall off of your computer . i know this because i did n't have to `` re-authorize '' my computer to use it again . i had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer . there are lots of hidden files . in conclusion , had it not been for my experience with the software i would have kept the player .
0	i have just now tested my signal strength at various locations with the d-link di-624 router 's original antenna , and with this one . the hai6sip made no difference whatsoever at any location , regardless of its orientation . it 's going back to the store tomorrow
0	i bought this to replace an 80gb portable firewire drive . wanted more capacity and the same convenient portability . there 's nothing convenient about its need for 2 usb slots and the data moves slower than the firewire drive it is replacing . nice little glitch on the small type of the packaging ... if you 're reading the requirements for mac os x you miss the bullet point in the win xp section calling out the need for 2 free ports . amazon 's description of the product is similarily misleading as completely negelcts the mention of needing two usb ports ... boooo seagate . i 'm offended that you 're offering such clumsy connectivity
0	as you may have read elsewhere , this router has a problem with the gre protocol used by microsoft for their pptp server ( see alan bryant 's may 27 , 2004 review ) . this will stop you using it with the built-in pptp vpn client/server which is provided with windows 2000/xp . here is the text of a complaint i have submitted to linksys ... `` i am attempting to operate a microsoft pptp server behind a befvp41 ( firmware 1.41.1 ) . i have pptp pass through enabled and port 1723 forwarded to the fixed ip address of the server but the router refuses to pass the gre protocol used by microsoft ( protocol 47 ) . in answer id 737 , you suggest forwarding port 47 presumably in a belief that this has something to do with gre . it does not and is therefore not the solution to this problem . gre does not use tcp/udp port 47 , it is 'protocol 47 ' , something entirely different . it seems that the the writer of answer 737 has neither tested this scenario nor has a true understanding of the nature of this problem . i and others have investigated this problem extensively using protocol analysers at the client and server ends and can only conclude that the present version of firmware in the befvp41 ( 1.41.1 ) is incapable of handling the gre protocol correctly . can you please advise when a fix will be implemented ? this is seriously devaluing an otherwise good product . i also suggest that you amend answer 737 as it is misleading and will frustrate others less versed in ip protocols than myself . '' i await a reply from linksys as i write this review . having said all that , if you have no interest in running the microsoft pptp server , the befvp41 may do everything else you require . it functions okay as a basic nat router and it 's stealth capabilities are good ( steve gibson 's 'shields up ' reports 'true stealth ' as long as you forward port 113 to a non-existant host ) . the in-built ipsec tunneling works well . i am using one to provide permanant tunnels to a number of befsx41 's very reliably . the web interface is a little odd at times but it does do the job reasonably and you do get used to it eventually . to summarise : a reasonable basic nat router . very good stealth . ipsec tunneling works okay ( at least to other linksys products ) . microsoft 's pptp server will not work with the current firmware version .
1	this is the first dvd recorder i purchased . i used the quick set up guide and i was off to the races . the quality of my recordings are crisp and clear . the nero software is user friendly and makes recording dvds easy . i 'm totally satisfied with my purchase plus i 'm recieving a [ ... ] rebate to top it off
1	this is my second set of garmin radios . i have had the 120 's for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530 's . first of all i really like the new color screen and the added features . the altimeter has been upgraded over the 120 's and seems to be more accurate . my old 120 's sitting right next to each other would display different altitudes . i would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models . we do a quite a bit of skiing an the altitude displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied . especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top . the new compass is also helpful . with the older models you would have to be moving for the compass to work right . after calibrating the new compass ( turning in a circle ) it will work just like a regular compass . i still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup , but the compass on the 530 works great and has not let me down . you can also route off the compass by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go . the 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and ca n't see your next way point . as with all the rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side . i really think it 's because of the waterproofing that they do . if you do n't put it close to your mouth when speaking it 's really not that bad . i did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications . lock up problem . i have experienced this once or twice the first time i used them . i did the garmin update and have not had the problem since . overall these new 530 's are great . i have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week . now that i have 4 of these ( 2 120 's and 2 530 's ) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group . looking forward to the ski slopes this winter . we always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours . if you do a lot of outdoor activities or any geocaching with more than one person these are perfect ! !

1	i have been looking for a larger cf card for my dell axim x50v . the seagate cf drive does not work . finally , i got this working for this price . i think it 's good .
1	i read the other reviews on this bookholder and was n't so sure about it . however , after buying and trying it out , i have no regrets . do n't know why i waited soo long to get one ( dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one ) . although made of plastic , it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding . the clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold . unlike other models , this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books . i have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem
1	i was burned by another company with i bought their product and they did n't offer a replacement plan . the item died and no one can repair it
0	this product will not fix your disc , i tried to fix a damaged cd and it only made the problem worse . i ended up throwing away the cd and the skipdoctor . this is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work , i wish someone would have told me this before i spent money on it
1	after ruining another pair of over-the-head headphones , i decided to check these out . they are actually on sale at 50 % off , and i 've just tried mine out . the audio is very sharp , especially with the base , though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair , i can just increase the volume to compensate . at $ 35 , this is a great deal . they feel great . the band that most headphones have presses down on your head , but not too much . it also folds down quite nicely , though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress . have n't tried out the actual noise-cancellation feature , but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent , then it will work just as well . it also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your mp3 player , if you so wished . however , it easily fits into a jacket pocket . great , great , great design and comfort
0	i had my pink ipod mini since feb. 2005 . it was fine until it died the next year on the exact day i got it , and the warranty ran out . i got it repaired at an apple reseller , and then it died again on the warranty expiration date . what is it with the ipods ? it 's like they have a self destruct inside ! ) : -
0	i wish i had read the problems and netgear.com forums before purchasing this product . huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily . this requires you unplug and plug back in the ap in order for it to stay visable to your computers . second problem i am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare , and even at 3-5feet from the ap the unit is around 11-36mpbs . do not buy this product , find another company who stands behind there products . all of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in india . people on the phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke . latest firmware fixes none of the problems
0	do n't buy it . in the 6 months i had the phone , the screen burnt out so i can see the numbers , the answering machine is horrible , and i get better reception from my baby monitor . i had a cheap panasonic beforehand which was much better . this was a complete waste of $ $ . hooking it up to your pc to get those `` cool '' features is just a pain . i 'm having a tough time returning this . be careful
0	so , i bought this a couple months ago . at first , i was in love . great sound quality , and the surround sound aspect works well in fps games . also very comfortable , much more so than any other 5.1 headphones i have owned . the initial favorable impression wore of pretty quickly , though . first of all , the microphone *sucks* . i 've seen better microphones on 20 $ radio shack headphones . these are gaming headphones , and expensive ones at that . you would think the microphone would be at least passable . it is n't . secondly , the build quality is pretty bad . within a few weeks , the control brick started giving me problems . the sound would go off on one side or the other . a bit annoying . this only happens sporadically , and can be `` fixed '' by squeezing the sound controller . not quite bad enough for me to seek a replacement , but annoying nonetheless . i 've also discovered that the headphones are assembled with screws - screws that are n't properly inserted , and they have a tendency that fall out . now i have a washer flopping around inside the right headphone , and i ca n't find the tiny screw . so i 'll have to either try and repair it myself , which means trying to find somewhere i can buy tiny rare screws , or have to send it in for repair . i might as well send it in for repair , because maybe they could also fix the volume controller ... really kind of disappointing for supposedly `` premium '' gaming headphones . the microphone is bad enough to almost make it worthless for ventrillo or ts . and the problems with build quality are really unacceptable for headphones of this price . i bought some 5.1 headphones for 40 $ a few years back ... they only lasted a year , but they had none of the issues that the razer has . kind of sad that a cheap chinese imitation is actually of better quality than this expensive crap .
0	the only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection . it is nice that it has a clip , and it fits the mp3 player snugly , but ... would be nice if it has a clear `` window '' to protect the screen
1	i have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance . the disaster recovery software provided with this drive is it 's biggest star . you can format your hard drive , put in the restore disk that you create for your system , and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to exactly the way it was when you created the disk . or you can simply replace selected files if you want . it does not miss a single thing . fanstastic . the software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an `` abc '' book . i would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use
1	i did my research before purchasing this wireless card from amazon to use in conjunction with my belkin pre-n wireless router . according to every net review i 'd read , this combination of belkin pre-n desktop card and router had the best range and throughput at that range than any other card/router in its class , and as my workstation is out in the middle of a farm an almost impossible distance from the router , 'range ' is what i needed above all . after some configuration and finding the best spot to put the computer itself , i now regularly have connection qualities in the 77-90 % range a good 200-300 ft. from my router which is in another building entirely ( and both have a lot of metal cladding and what-not i had expected to cause a great deal of interference if not outright unworkability . ) the odd thing about this 'pre-n ' combination from belkin is that apparently the later belkin n equipment is grossly inferior , and manages to pull off only about half the range of this model . these cards and the pre-n router are becoming harder to find as they 've been superseded by the newer ( inferior ) models currently in the stores , so if you have to operate wireless at great distances , i doubt you 'll beat these belkin models for at least the immediate future
0	the worst customer service i have ever experienced . the lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said : '' you got it cheaper than other brands , what else do you expect ? '' `` viking cheats . so what ?

0	i would like to believe that this hub works well- but i would n't know . i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac . i hooked up my printer , ipod and digital camera and nothing happened . i called targus and they said i needed an a/c adaptor . it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions , or their website . they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info ( 5 volt , 2.1 amp , center positive ) . i 've been to two radio shacks and online- they do n't carry it . i 'm upset . any advice
0	in short , why a 1 star rating you wonder ? took forever to set up properly ; long wait time and poor help from tech support ; automatic set-up i doubt will ever work for anyone . though it does work once finally set up . __________________________________________________________ so i decided to go wireless at home with a new laptop , new wireless router , and a wireless print server ( ps ) , so i can put the printer in the garage and free up space in the house . i did a lot of research and decided to get a belkin router ( f5d7231-4 ) and this ps from the same manufacturer so hopefully they would set-up easily together . this is definitely not the case ! first be warned this product is not wpa compatible ! thus , even though the router is wpa able , you can not use wpa with the ps and thus have to use wep for the network once this product is used . hopefully in the future this product will support wpa , but it would only hopefully do so thru a firmware upgrade . do not think this ps is wpa compatible . next , be warned the box says `` 3 minute easy install '' - well it took me about 12 hours total to get the ps working now wirelessly . i am not a computer techie , but i am smart , a great problem solver , and savvy enough to teach myself how to create a whole html website with hundreds of pages . i tried to set-up the ps on a static ip address , as recommended by my techie friends , but this just did not happen . thus , next time i restart the router it may assign the ps a different ip address and then i 'll have to find it thru the router interface and reconfigure the printer set-up for that new address-so i plan to spend more time in the future revisiting this issue . the crux of how i got it to work is by using the router interface and entering the mac addresses of the ps and computers in the network . this is the golden key i searched for for hours trying all permutations of all the other settings in the router 's and ps 's web interfaces . only this way was i able to unhook the land-line from the ps to the router and get it to interface and thus work wirelessly . belkin tech support had medium wait time , friendly techs ( not always speaking english without thick accents though ) , and they were unable to solve my golden key for me . they even promised a chief tech would call me back but that never happened . so , yes , the product works fine but just be warned from someone perhaps like yourself that i had to learn way more about this whole network/configuration issue than i ever wanted or expected to , and i had to manually configure the whole set-up to get this product to work .

1	never having had any other headphones i do n't really know how to compare these , but the speakers definetely work fine and i can identify different directions ' sounds ... but there is a small crackling in the background that wo n't go away and i ca n't find out why
0	i bought this headset from retailer ( offline ) , and returned it the next day . first off , i have to make it clear that i had no problems with sound . even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger ( they use 40mm drivers ) , the sound quality of the headset was just fine . however , when it comes to wearing these headphones , the only words that come to mind are `` uncomfortable as sin '' . the awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears ( and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation ) . also , i have no idea what material they used for the cup pads , but it is nowhere near soft enough ... in fact , i litterally could n't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red ( flush ) from discomfort . mind you , i also own a cheap pair of koss headphones i can keep on for hours at a time , so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either ... but these things , they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time , which is n't good at all . discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return . if your ears are tough , you should have no problem with this headset . the sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you . however , if you 're looking for comfort and good sound isolation , you 'll want to look elsewhere..
1	works great , looks great , no problems . 22 '' monitor for this price ? more than i expected !
0	seldom do i write a review downgrading a product but this one is truly the exception . i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal . price-wise , it was great . however , it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well . the directions are terrible . they are extremely difficult to follow . i never could get it to sync with outlook . i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work . i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was child 's play in comparison . in this case , you get what you pay for . do n't purchase this , you 'll be sorry . take care , it 's a time bandit and even if it were to function flawlessly , the design with all of its attempted functions is way too much . punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen , ad nauseum . do you carry the manual with you . put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the english language . truly disappointed with this worthless plastic .
1	popped it in , works like a charm . hardest part is opening the packaging , but other than that no worries
0	the suspicious side of me wants to believe that hp did a promo with their deskjet 612c - i.e . they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements . i would be surprised if there is any difference between the 612c black replacement cartridge c6614 and the much more common cartridge for the 660c other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case
1	i 've had this printer for four years . i print approximately 25 documents each week . this is the first time that i have had to replace the cartridge . it 's a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time , too . compared to ink jet printers that i have had , i get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet -- and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets . great buy
0	this was a great mouse for about the first year i owned . after one year is when all of the problems started . the mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it does n't want to connect at all . i have changed the battery quite a few times and that does n't seem to help . it is very tempremental , and i have now given up and am shopping for a replacement . so , a word to the wise - in my experience the mouse will work great for a while , just be prepared to replace it in a year or so
0	there are many aspects of the t5 people want to count as negatives . for me i consider them annoyances but not killers . i would like to have wifi with my pda but i am not dead with out it . more memory is always good but the t5 is n't on the hurting side . it 's not a good mp3 player with the memory it has . and even if you have a 2g card with mp3 's it 's not like this is what you would buy for mp3s . but as far as contact information , on the go applications etc.. i would consider this as good as any other . the problem as i have just found out is these are known to die . i have n't heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the t5 will at some point die . it will lock up and even after all the resets listed from palm it will not come back to even a factory state . you will have a palm powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top . there are a couple of fixes . if you are under warranty you can send it back to palm for them to make it better . or you can remove the battery and solder it back . this is a serious design issue that palm is more than happy to charge you for . until i ran into this i would have rated this a 4/5 . until this happened the device did what i expected it to do . i read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no wifi . but it has one of the fastest processors ( available at that time ) in a pda . which was a different type of cool . the bluetooth works well enough i have n't had any issues with it . you can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi is n't really that big of a deal . but if you ca n't trust your device is going to be working the next day it really does n't matter what cool feature it has . this has been a very expensive let down . i do n't want to buy another palm after this experience but i am not sure what to switch to ...
1	i almost did n't purchase this cd player because of all the bad reviews it had been getting , but i decided to go for it ! i am glad i did , i am very happy with this sony walkman ! i use it for walking , listening to meditating cds , audio books , everything and have not had one single problem with it . i am so glad i did not let the few negative reviews sway my decision ! as mentioned in another review , i love that if you have to stop playing whatever your listening to it will pick up on the same track when you press play again , it also fits in my back pocket so i can walk around the house listening to anything while doing chores , the earpieces fit well , there is absolutley nothing wrong with this walkman ! those of you who seemed to have this walkman break in 2-3 weeks must not take care of your things . i love it , the price was great , so do n't let the negative reviews stop you on this purchase !
0	this is a great idea : a small cd player to match the rest of the tivoli line . unfortunately , the quality of the units i tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the tivoli line . all in all , tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems : one would n't play the disc , one would n't eject the disc , one had an led readout that would go blank , and one had variations on all of these problems . the model one is a great product and the pal and the others are close behind , but the model cd needs a lot more work
0	i used a 25 pack of these doing dvd backups , and the last 5 or so failed . i thought it was my software , so i got new software . guess what ? my first disc out of the new package of 25 that i bought failed , too . it 's not my burner ( as another reviewer suggested , implying that people should learn to read ) , as it 's brand new and does n't require the firmware upgrade they mention . they just suck and have a high failure rate . so the consensus seems to be that tdk or sony are best . i 'm buying some now and save myself the frustration
0	upon the joyful news that we were having a girl , my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer . the digital camera still works great -- the printer is another matter . while this one prints beautiful pictures , the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes . as we all know , this is how printer companies make their money , through the ink . replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $ 75 at a time , give or take a few . the gray ink is used up the quickest , and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally . the main problem i have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink , but for only about the first 50-70 pictures . after that . the pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register -- very frustrating when you 're printing out any pictures , let alone ones of your child . yes , we do what the manual sugests for such occasions , and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads , but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion . every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to . in the long run , i will not be buying a photo printer for home use , but will rather take them to a store for processing . quality-wise , it gets you in the beginning , but does n't hold out for the long run . we have fiddled with it for two years . enough 's enough
1	this is the only type of speaker cable i use to connect my state of the art sound system
0	i bought this printer based on its good reviews . it does print beautiful photos but i have n't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon . canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only . the problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly . after several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual i contacted canon . they ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body
1	these speakers deliver a clear , crisp , and vibrant sound , with a richness expected of a higher-end speaker . i would recommend these to anyone interested in a good-quality sound but keeping an eye on price
1	this device is great for carriying around with your camera , you can review and share the pictures with any pc with usb available , data can also be recorded and easily recovered .
0	my wait has been 17 weeks and i received my monthly email today pushing out the delivery date another 30 days . one big difference ! ! ! ! the item is now listed as available but for more money than i agreed to pay back in november . if this is amazon 's way of making me take a walk and give circuit city my $ $ $ , it worked
0	i had a pronto neo for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after i dropped it 1.5 feet onto a hardwood floor . the unit has a very cheap feel , especially for the price . i was n't at all surprised when it stopped working . the pc software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap . the touchscreen is very tedious to customize ( i write software for a living , and i still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen ) . i ca n't imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit , given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your pc to the remote . the whole point of the pronto neo is that you can customize the touch screen . unless you are very comfortable with computer applications , do not buy this unit . aside from the touchscreen 's fagility , is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small , given the size of the remote . did i mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months ? in short , this product is crap . i might consider buying another one if it sold for $ 30 or less
1	there is not a lot to this device . simply plug the wire that comes with it into your yamaha amplifier and receiver and away you go . the ipod gets charged , and on my receiver i can even select the song to play via the on-screen gui on the tv
1	excellent service , but i expected to see another model of the handbag . it looked different on the picture
0	there are brands i trust and ones i do n't . sony has always been a trusted brand . but after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken . i should have read these other reviews before i made my purchase , but because this unit is a sony i trusted it would be a superior product . the problems i had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews : when playing cds in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a cd and quitting . i followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the onkyo dx c390 6 disc changer . i am hoping i have better luck .
1	these folks continue to amaze me with their advancement of the state of the art in memory , and amazon purchase and delivery is so dependable it 's like money in the bank . i hope no one comes in and tries to `` improve '' things .
1	so far this seems to be an extremely effective ( and inexpensive ) way to store pictures captured with a multi-mega pixel digital camera . the sevice provided by this company shipping-wise was very fast . all-in-all a great deal
0	pros : perfect sound , solved resampling issues cons : famous popping/crackling noises makes it useless for gaming , especially in bf2 ( which use openal by creative ) . crystallizer is useless . this card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20 % of high end systems , not only nvidia nforce 4 chipset , but also with other amd and intel cpu motherboards : see google for `` x-fi popping/crackling '' . even if you do not have in game crackling immediately , you have a good chance to get it after any memory or hd upgrade or driver configuration change . for long time creative denied existence of this problem . eventually it was recognized ( see official cl forums ) and a new driver ( since november 2005 ! ) was promised at the end of may 2006 , but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem . in the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial `` hacked '' drivers . i suspect that x-fi crackling is an architecture design flow , which can not be completely solved at software level , because pci bus can not provide sufficient memory access for the `` the fastest sound processor '' simultaneously with high end graphic card , hd controller , and other devices . bottom end : i have to stop playing games , or go back to low quality integrated sound . do not take risk , wait for working drivers , or buy a working card from different manufacturer . with fixed drivers i would give this card 4 or 5 stars . update 06/12/2006 i found that many desktop motherboards ( mb ) have really slow south bridge ( south bridge is connecting pci , usb , firewire , and hd to cpu directly or through north bridge ) , especially mbs with nvidia chipsets ( and even with some intel mbs ) . new beta x-fi driver and mb bios updates solved the problem in many cases ( but not for my mb asrock k8nf4g-sata2 , nvidia 6100 / 410 mcp chipset ) , but situation is still marginal and x-fi might go unstable again . i contact cl customer service , they did not solved the problem , but pointed out that ati chipsets ( athlon 64 , ati 200 or 3200 ) have no problems with x-fi . i decided not to return sb to seller , but save it for a new computer with ati based mb . i guess that majority of workstation class mbs with upscale south bridge and pci-x ( even nvidia based ) also should be fine with x-fi . the trouble is that majority of x-fi buyers have generic nvidia based mbs like me . so i can give x-fi two stars instead of 1 ( but i can not change the rating ) , and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release ( if it will work )
0	i purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my bose main speakers for my surround sound set up . at that time , i felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as i listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups i came to realize that the bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par . so last year , i purchased a polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane . the polk speaker which costs the same as the bose ( $ 199 ) was far and away the better product . the sound is cleaner , crisper , sharper ... it made watching movies much more enjoyable . i could n't believe what i had been missing out on all these years . the only reason i purchased the bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound i have now with polk center and bose main is excellent . depending on who you ask , the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system . if that 's true then i would n't recommend bose because all you 're doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that 's a waste of money . i know because i made that mistake .
1	need to info customer that optical sound cable is required for sound from ps2 console
0	after my trusty archos player 's display broke , i figured i upgrade and get me a 60gb iaudio x5 . as a journalist doing interviews , i was also very giddy to get the line-in to record interviews straight to mp3 . a friend of mine loves his player , so i did n't even flinch when i saw the price . ever since then i regret my decision . apparently my player has a software problem . it speeds up all my mp3 files . i tried several different programs to rip the mp3s and always got the same thing . that is when i was actually able to upload mp3s , because oftentimes i received error messages and the player refused to do as told . so what then : upgrade the firmware . sure . if you can make it work and i could n't . the description online is poorly written . but it 's essentially like this : start with a fully loaded battery . unplug the a/c cabel and unpload the firmware . now replug the a/c cable and that should tell the player to update the firmware . well all it does is conclude that the battery is n't full anymore so it better recharges and does nothing else . i.e . i could n't get the firmware to update and i tried for the last hour . therefore i 'll take the player back to the store and ask for a refund . and i 'll get another archos - and continue to live with its misely 20gb
0	ymmv , but my 80gb drive died after 6 months . i found this be very handy to have around to transfer large files between work and home , but i expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of . i 'm glad i back up my data in more than one place
1	i 'd been using wireless for gaming for the past 3 months and always had lag problems even if the latency said it was around 50 . i got the set of these and they work awesome . just plug one into an outlet next to your pc and one next to your router . run the cat5 cables from one to the pc and one to the router and you are all set . now i can do my gaming without the lag i got from wireless and have yet to have any problem with these . these are truly plug and play . now if only they were a little cheaper
1	so far , so good ! only takes up 1u in our rack . this product arrived in good shape and on time . setup was a breeze . right now we only have 2 servers connected to it , but switching between them is no problem , so i do n't foresee a problem when we add 4 more . -kevi
1	bought this mp3 player for my girlfriend for christmas . she loves it . it is small and easy to use . the headphones could be better though . the process of puting songs onto the player is simple and fast . considering you can not hear the music without headphones ... and the headphones that come with it are not very good , it only gets a 4 out of 5
1	the apple airport card - network adapter - airport 802.11b was a fabulous purchase . it did exactly what it was supposed to , was easy to install and test , worked immediately . the vendor that supplied the airport card was prompt , efficient , courteous , and careful in the packaging . very happy with the product
0	camera died after firmware upgrade using the ethernet port to perform upgrade as dlink recommends . i bought from ebay new and dlink refused to replace or repair . so beware if you pay several hundred dollars make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer or dlink want work on it or even attempt to help you get it repaired . think twice about buying dlink because down the road you may have to throw it away regardless of the price you paid . need to research other brands and see what their repair policy is after warranty , from unauthorized seller , or buying used .
0	i have always been a fan of sony because they make quality products that are `` user-friendly '' . that is why i was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by sony , because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture . first the bad ... the control buttons ( sound , changing tracks , pause , etc ) are tiny and nearly impossible to read . i found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button , and i do not have any vision problems . the little lcd screen is hard to read as well . next , the sound quality is poor and has a cheap `` watered down '' feel to it . then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with . these are cheap and do n't fit well . i bought a yellow `` psyc '' sony walkman a couple years ago , and that one is 3 times the product that this one is . the sound is near-perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use . the headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all . i would n't write sony off simply b/c of this product , but i would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them .
0	first off the software is horrible ! ! i have xp media center and the win2000 interface program wo n't even run . the hardware drivers interfere with other programs on my computer ; now my cineplayer has no sound and when i double click on my speaker icon in my tray , an error message comes up saying i have no active mixer devices available . i spent hours trying to resolve and my computer is still messed up . the remote is useless , i will have to get a microsoft remote , and the picture quality using media center is poor at best . save your money and avoid this item . if you have to try it , i highly recommend installing norton goback or similar software to undo the problems you will have . you have been warned ! !
0	this item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of casio exilim camera , but was never delivered . now amazon wants me to review it , so here your are..
0	i did not receive the correct product that i ordered . i informed the seller and he stated that i would need to resell on ebay myself . very disappointed with his service . kell
1	my doctor recommended getting a wrist support when using my computer because i had previous carpal tunnel surgery.ilove the way it comforts the wrist.the gel inside is different than other gel pads i had in the past.it really does give great support and comfort.it can prevent future problems for your wrist.iam glad amazon carries it
1	this is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference . but to see the beam ( not just the dot at the end of the beam ) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of . using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out . and if you are wondering , no matter how bright your laser is , without particles in the air you wont see the beam . at concerts where they use the big argon lasers , they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of
1	the xmb-10 is a great way to listen to my xm audiovox receiver at home . the boombox is slightly larger than i desired , but the sound is great , it 's easy to use , lightweight , very portable and nice looking .
0	first t5 lasted 6 months , then just refused to start - was replaced under warranty . this one locked up after about 3 months - was replaced again under warranty . the third t5 lasted about 5 months . it 's now out of warranty and wo n't start or reset . no - i 'm not rough on my pdas . none of them got even as much as a scratch . each one looked like new when it `` broke '' . the first 2 times , palm told me the rom had failed . i guess it 's the same problem again , but i 'm not spending $ 169 to get it swapped for another faulty t5 . good bye palm . out of the box i think it 's a good pda , so check those 4 and 5 star reviews to see how long the users have had their pdas before you buy
0	i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company , plus i liked the look of it . but after just 5 months after purchase , and not even using it that often , it has already broken . i paid about 40 dollars for this cd player , so i am very disappointed . if i were you , i would buy a different cd player
0	it came within one week of being ordered . it is an excellent product and is as advertised . i received a manual for sony 's compact disc recorder instead of the manual for the vrdvc30
0	this kit is neat ; i have to admit that . it comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book . however , the kit itself is a little pricey considering that a ) there 's only 10 pages , b ) the pages are only 5 x 7 , and c ) the pages are not double-sided . the software included , although as simple and easy-to-use as can be , is so limiting , it does n't actually feel like you have made this book yourself . instead , it 's as though you 're in preschool , bringing in the pictures and having teacher put it together for you . you can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please , but there is seldom the precise one that you really want . it does n't help that half of the themes have these cutesy `` scrap book '' elements that look absolutely ridiculous . however , the book itself is pretty slick once you make many , many comprimises . the only reason i gave this two stars is for the materials included
1	i gave my mother-in-law my old color sportrack so she could start geocaching . i was in search of a handheld unit with a bigger brighter screen . this unit is it . although it is large , it has features i like : aa batteries ( 19 hours ? , we 'll see ) , easy menu navigation , usb connection to a pc and a rugged case . i am an engineer so am kind of picky about user interfaces , etc . i have sent in a list of problems i have found with the menu navigation . all of them can be worked around , but it does n't work the way i think they intended . it will be interesting to see if magellan gets back to me and eventually provides a new version of fw ( i am using 1.05 ) . after doing a lot of research about megllan sw ( mostly negative ) , i decided to go ahead and purchase the mapsend directroute v.3 dvd . i found it acceptable and have had no real problems using it . one nit , the files it creates are very small . you need to edit a text file in the magellan directoy to allow it to save and download larger files . but once you get the maps downloaded to your unit ( very straight forward ) , the menus change to indicate turning direction . thus , it is getting closer to a crossover unit . interestingly , magellan will offer a new unit called the `` crossover '' ( available january 2007 ) . the specs are pretty sparse on the magellan web page
0	obviously , it 's cheap . but i 've had mine over a year now ... . no it has n't failed , but it does scare me . besides the plastic cracking , the fan is making me nervous . about half the time now when i turn it on the fan make this really loud buzzing noise , which changes frequency over time , slowing down . i have a bad feeling that the fan is not held in alignment well , and that the loud noise is the fan blades scraping against their surroundings ( because it vibrates quite a bit ) . this vibration can only mean bad things for the drive inside , and i 'm not looking forward to the day when my cheapo choice of enclosure causes my hd to crash and lose all my photos , music , backups , etc . currently shopping for a replacement , and i would not recommend this
0	i have been a subscriber for 4 years . back in november my account was turned off due to a billing issue . the week prior to it being turned off i started receiving 3 calls a day for payment . i advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment , payment was made . calls stopped for another week . the radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again . i explained to the bill collectors i owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio i told them not to bother , at this point i wanted nothing more to do with xm . they offered me 3 months of free service to come back , anyone who cancels can get this by the way , and i refused . the 3 calls a day continued for the next week , i was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system ... . 2 more months go by and then i start receiving a bill saying that i reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that . 40 dollars . i call in and state i never reactivated my radio , thus i do n't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed . the customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of , 2 weeks later i get another bill . i call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences . i even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved , and that rep confirmed that i no longer owed anything . so then last month i start receiving collections notices . you have one month to pay this before it goes to collections . i called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back . this apparently has taken care of the issue , though i never received the call back . this week i called 6 times , 3 of which i was promptly hung up on for no reason , and was told each time that it had been resolved . so hopefully this time it really is ... to anyone considering xm i suggest you just get an mp3 player
1	works as billed . i am currently playing a dvd+rl that would not play on any other player . i have not purchased a 1080p lcd tv , but it is why i purchased an upconverting dvd player . i have tried dvd+r and dvd+rw . i will be trying audio formats later . i would recommend this product to anyone who is waiting for the hd versus blueray to determine which will be the dominant technology and for its price to come down
0	one month in the wall and sounds like a expresso machine . my car 's engine sounds better . do n't waste your money . i called sharp and they say is the fan . great , maybe i should remove it and use ice cubes
0	this was the top rated system by consumer reports . i returned it . the sound quality of the message i recorded as a greeting sounded awful as did the sound of the messages i received . tried to record my greeting a number of ways , but they all sounded awful .
0	this memory did not work . still have yet to receive refund from seller
0	reception is not that great with the stock rubber duck antenna and also the press to talk button and the channel changing buttons are way to close together making it awkward to use , would not buy again .
1	i lost my original stylus ( left it at a restaurant ) . this replacement pack of styli are just like my original . i have none of the problems the other reviewer had . my stylus fits perfectly , and the telescoping top is just like my original . this is a great replacement
1	switch was simple to install to my existing network , just plug and go . i used this switch to separate some cpus off of the 100mb network and put them on the gig highway . worked just as planned and was seamless . i actually added two of these and saved big jack over a 16 port gig switch . network speed and response time increased even for those cpus w/out a gig nic . i like the idea of having a switch with capacity that far exceeds network traffic . highly recommend
1	overall a very nice charger , though recharge times are n't even close to what is advertised . the display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair . the 900 mah hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless .
1	i bought this part and the addition that makes it a double shelf . i have my tv on it and it 's great
1	great sound form small box . nice platform for tweaking . good power needed
1	love the wireless connection to my hp all-in-one scanner printer . works great
1	i was ready to take this player back to the store ! i checked the sandisk web site and stumbled across a link to `` how to '' videos . this was the best thing i could have found . the videos walk through all the settings you need to configure on your pc to get the player to work for drag and drop , showing album art ... i had no idea my pc was set not to show hidden folders ! who would hide folders anyway ? nonetheless i now have a player loaded with music and am a happy customer . like others have said the photo option is not that great so do n't buy it for that . i mostly want it for working out so pics do n't make much of a difference to me . dh has a 30g ipod so if i wan na see graphics i can just borrow that lol ! i have over 250 mp3 formatted songs on the player ( and it 's full ) and will likely get a micro sd card so i can expand it a little bit . all in all , i do like this little player
0	wasted my money for this slow hub ... be aware that if you want to connect your printer , scanner , ipod etc . to this device , think again
0	and also gave my children an amusing exhibition of what it was like to try to tune in a station on a tv circa 1963 . pulled in weak signals from about 3 stations 18 miles from nyc broadcast towers .
1	2gb sandisk is awesome . i can store lots of files in my pda and not worry about space . also the price was very afordable
0	the dvds are a rip-off , although i 'm counting on the rebate to at least break even ( not counting my time ) . the dvd player completely fails to recognize them . even after extensive troubleshooting with disk management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue ... . just a poor product -- velocity ought to be ashamed . more taiwanese junk . ( i 'd recommend verbatim 's dvd+r dl product - made in singapore ) as a note i can get other dvd-rs to work just fine ... i have n't submitted the rebate yet , so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments
0	as the title , it not worth the money at all even at such a low price . the picture quality is bad , very bad . i 'd rather spend this money for other web-cam
1	the maps are good enough for navigation of streets and outdoor adventures . it allows downloading tracks and waypoints from the gps , editing them and saving to files or the gps . it is annoying to have to put the last cd in your drive to use the program
1	when it comes to ink for my r1800 photo printer , i am concerned with the quality of the images i print . the epson matte black ultrachrome hi-gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water , fading and smudging . it is important to me that my prints are of high quality , so i do n't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges . the color can be duplicated , but all inks are not created equal . third party options may produce a good print initially , but may not hold up or last as long . pros : provides superior resistance to water , fading and smudging cons : pric
0	i have an iriver t10 and there is virtually no software to support the usb plug and play interface that mac owners have always expected . pay a little more and buy an ipod . it interfaces with pcs and macs equally well .
1	great product ! very pleased with my decision to get this over the 100 so i could replace my alarm clock . set it up just for the counties near me and turned off all the alerts i was not interested in
1	works great out of the box . some reviews mentioned problems with the cd but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try . it mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet . no problem with signal strength happy to say since the unit it replaced had problems . the brightness of the digital clock is adjustiable and i use it as a night light in the kitchen . the remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater ( magnet ) with my wife useing it to hang things . this is a thomson inc product ( purchased the ge rca names several years ago ) that makes tv 's ect . i am very happy with the product and recommend it
0	will not hold bose souround spkrs , will not mount for key hole speakers , also i paid $ 11.99 for these on amazon , the saw them in wal-mart for $ 7.78 good for a cheap system , but if your speakers weigh more than 5 lbs . step u
0	after just one week of use and installing the newest firmware , this router began showing sickly signs requiring a daily reboot . by week two it began needing to be rebooted every 15 minutes . this now seems typical of previous experiences i have had with other netgear products . so much for plug and play . my recommmendation : leave netgear to the passive routers and use another brand for firewalls and dhcp serving
0	i ordered the unit twice , and twice i received a carrying case . not the adapter . i returned both and ordered direct from cobra . when i had called customer support for amazon the second time , i got connected to india of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong . i guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says .
0	do n't buy if you plan on printing often ... runs out very very fast .
1	after reading several reviews of this product i was skeptical about buying this cable . i wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my ps2 but i was not sure about paying the price for these when the sony cables are about half the cost of the monster cables . the reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the ps2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the tv almost discouraged me from even buying this product . i decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my ps2 . i am very happy that i decided to buy these cables . the cable connector fits perfectly into my ps2 , better than the connector on my original sony cables even . the connectors fit nicely onto my tv , they are snug but not too tight . i believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my tv because of the 8-cut turbine connector , which fits better than a standard rca plug . the video and audio from my ps2 is unbelievable . my ps2 pushes the video signal to my 32 '' lcd hd tv at 480i with these cables . with my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry . now the graphics are crisp and clear and i only wish i would have bought these sooner . the display from my ps2 and games fits nicely onto my tv in widescreen now too , before the picture was not centered on my tv and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen . i would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their ps2 over the stock sony cables . there are other monster cable versions for the ps2 available so choose the one that is right for you , but if you want something that is moderately priced , do n't need digital audio via fiber , and the next best thing to hdmi than this is the cable for you . i am going to get the monster component cables for my ps3 next so i will be able to hook it up when i do n't have hdmi available for it to use . one more thought , be sure to change the video output on your ps2 from rgb to y cb/pb cr/pr in the system configuration before hooking up your ps2 with these cables or it may not work . my tv told me the connection was not supported and i did not have video output until i changed the video output setting on my ps2
1	i 've been very pleased with this external drive-500gb . my only comments would be that at first the drive was a little 'hit or miss ' with mounting on the desktop but a restart would always fix it . now it seems to always mount . its all automatic so no need to ever touch the drive . the other thing would be that it could use one more firewire 400 port ( there is only one ) . i do n't use 800 yet so i need to daisy it off of my smartdisk firelite that happens to have 2 . all in all-get this drive
1	i recently purchased this item and i am very happy with its performance and quality . i use it daily in the gym it delivers excellent sound and you dont even realize you have it on due to its light weight
1	awesome video card.. im using this with dvi cable on my 22 inch viewsonic lcd . i must say it installed great and looks awesome ! ! great card for the money def a happy customer ! ! :
1	i use print works cd/dvd envelopes and was worried when i ordered this product that the envelopes would n't fit top-up which is important for me because i label the tops of my envelops to make looking through them easier . the envelopes are just a hair over 5 '' wide and they fit into these storage boxes perfectly . there is just enough room on either side to make flipping through the dvds easy . i ordered four of these and am glad i did . i keep them on a shelf side-by-seide and the make a perfect card-catalog-type filing systemfor all my dvds . i will most definately be ordering up more of these when i need more room ; these boxes are great . if you use a 5 '' wide envelope , rest assured that these boxes are just the right size to fit all your dvds .
0	had this set of speakers for close to a year now . they really are nothing special for the price . one problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift ( if you lock in a signal at all ) ! they do come with power cord to plug each speaker into ac . i have outside wiring so this is no trouble . two if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.if you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone , and mounting them in a high traffic area ( i mounted mine high above head level ) , do n't purchase them
1	i enjoyed putting this together . the spacers kinda threw me until i realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf . i got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the dvd shelves were n't spaced properly [ cd sized ] so i had to take it apart and redo it , but that was n't too bad . the spacers snap apart easily enough , even for my feeble fingers . it 's not terribly sturdy [ maybe i did n't get the poles screwed down tightly enough ] but as long as it 's in its permanent location , holds the multimedia well . i really like the way it looks . bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one , too :
0	if there were a catagory for 0 stars , that 's what i would have rated it . i bought this model only because i wanted a tv that would fit into a small space on a kitchen counter . the radio works , the cd works , but the tv died after l month . and the tv was the only part i was interested in . what kind of product is this ? i would like amazon to pick up this item and issue me a credit . carol gruber
1	the parallel usb adapter worked just like it was supposed to . my problem was that the printer i was using it with was no longer supported in windows xp . so while the adapter turned out to be useless , i 'm keeping it for possible future use
0	i ordered two of these . for the first one , neither the firewire nor the usb worked on my imac g5 ( macos 10.3.9 ) . a copy would start , and then hang after a while . i returned it and the second one worked using usb , but the firewire would hang like the first one . a friend has one that works fine with his ibook g4 under 10.3 .
0	besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned , belkin support is horrible . the automated system consistenly disconnects the call , requiring going through their operator . my 4-port kvm stopped functioning after six months . there 's no information on the web to help either . it 's as if there is no way to fix a kvm that does n't work . flash upgrading is a joke . i followed the procedure directly from belkin 's website . so i had to rma replace it . trust me , belkin does n't care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall . go with iogear - they include all the cables with the kvm switch for the price of belkin 's without cables
1	recently bought this receiver to replace a dead one . there is n't really anything special about this receiver , but it a solid one . the two year warranty tells me they stand by their product , in case of a problem ( hopefully i wo n't need to use the warranty ) . it gives good , clean power and sound . do n't let the 75w/channel fool you . this is a high current receiver and it has a good amount of power . time will tell , however , how well this receiver performs . also , for the price amazon was selling for , i could n't pass it up .
0	my cd player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above . i called the harman kardon customer service line , and they kept me on hold for ten minutes . then i went to their website , which is poorly designed and slow to load due to an overabundance of flash graphics . the website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to harman . i had to do that three times to get a response . finally i got a return authorization after two days and several emails . poor quality , poor customer support . guess what h-k , i wo n't be buying any of your products in the future . this is a replacement for a sony changer that worked flawlessly for 18 years . and , i may take hk to small claims court if the replacement does n't work .
0	i owned this product for about one week , very nice little piece which i can take to work or jogging , but today when i am copying some files to it from my computer , it stopped working , even reset did n't work , so i will return it for a refund and try different products
1	this is a good compact flash card . this is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive .
0	claiming that this fan 's `` 3-speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling '' , is very misleading . on low , the fan barely moves any air . on high , it still does n't move much air , and is incredibly quiet , nearing silent in my opinion . if you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads , this is not the fan for you . the 3-speed switch is useless , as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high
0	i was hoping for a great deal on these batteries , but like other reviewers i 've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast . i 'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two aa 's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two aa 's lasted only a week . be warned that these are n't quite the bargain they may initially seem
1	right price and works off of usb ! the sound is terrible on macbook so this will fill in nicely
1	i use this scanner primarily for text documents and could n't be more impressed . you do need text software - i have textbridge - but i find relatively few errors in the scan , proofreading and corrections are easy and efficient . best of all , i do n't have another device plugged into my computer or taking up space on my desk . caution - i have n't used it for photos , but it does a great job on text
0	i purchased this cable as a replacement , and it is far worse than the original i had . there is noticable `` shadow '' distortion . my advice is to buy a higher quality cable w/ ferriete beads . this cable was not useable
1	it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive . i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in . this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords , which is a big plus to me . the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin .
1	unless that i made an order for terk technologies leapfrog lf-30s wireless 2.4 ghz a/v distribution system , i received another wireless system from terk co , but the point is that this system is working properly , and right now i 'm able to have greek tv via internet to my desktop , and via the terk wireless system downstairs to my living-room tv appliance . during the operational time , i saw that i do n't have good resolution . i do n't know if the reason is because this distance between my office and my living-room ( the office is above from the living-room - so there is no big distance at all ) . but anyway , i will track this equipment , and if everything is ok i will buy one receiver more . thank you .
0	do not buy this product . it is incredibly slow , by far the slowest usb drive out of the dozen or so that i 've used . it handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files . i attempted to copy ~50mb ( 1500 files , 800 directories ) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy ! that 's roughly 27k/second . deleting the files was painful as well , taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything . for kicks , i popped in an old 128 mb kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds . bottom line is do n't be fooled by the drive 's small physical size , large capacity and price point : it simply does n't perform
0	very disappointed in this phone . i have an early generation uniden phone ( without answering machine ) that was a total joy . this turkey has weak audio and ear-piercing intermittent static . if you bother to look at earlier reviews , you will see that this is a common problem with this phone . avoid at all costs
1	i own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds . i have to say that the only way to improve upon this product , other than offering more color combinations , would be to make it bulletproof , which it damn near is already . a wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory . although $ 15 might come across as steep for such a small product , the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds . the $ 100+ shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected . the sendstation earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it 's category
1	he estado disfrutando de este tv por alredeor de 5 dias , la imagen es muy buena , facil de instalar , lo unico que se deberia mejorar es el sonido .
1	i 've been using these earbuds for several months now , and they 're far better than the ones that come with the ipod . they 're more comfortable , and there 's so much more bass , although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass . my pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once , and they still sound just as good as the day i got them ! ( i did have to glue one of the earpieces back together , though . ) i thought i 'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet , but these things are industrial strength
1	i received them ok none broken or cracked . this price beats walmarts price and these cases are as good as any slim cases i have ever used . i like the translucent back better than the black ones at staples
1	the case is nice , but i bought it thinking it would hold my folding keyboard . it was too small . the price was great , and the transaction was flawless
1	for the money , i got a good quality product . my purchase experience was good , and product was received in a timely manner
1	i needed to have an s-video feed from my classroom computer to a projector and to a tv/monitor . this proved to be the most cost-effective solution to the problem . it works just as hoped
1	i researched tvs for a long time before i ended up buying this set . it helped that costco offered a coupon for $ 300 off the price ( $ 1000 final price ) . i thought i may not like the tv , so i decided to buy in person as opposed to online to help with a potential return . however , there is no way i am returning this tv ; it 's awesome . the picture is great , and that is just with sd . the strech feature makes the regular 4:3 picture fit the screen and not look distored . i was worried about buying the 37 '' tv and then having to watch with the black bars on the sides to avoid distortion . but there is no need with this tv since sharp has figured out how to strech the picture without distortion . dvds look incredible on this tv as well . what is even better is the built-in hd tuner . i was debating upgrading my cable to the hd package , but i decide to spend $ 13 on `` rabbit ears '' from target . oh my , once i plugged in the indoor antenna and let the tv track for digital stations i was amazed . the analog station popped up like a fierce snowstorm in winter , but when i went up to the hd digital companion station , i could n't believe my eyes . an incredible hd picture with the rabbit ears set on my desk ... indoors no less ! why would i upgrade my cable tv to the hd package when they ca n't offer the local stations in hd ? especially when they are free with a simple antenna ! i was told this was possible , but quite frankly i was skeptical . not anymore , i am so glad i got the sharp that has the built-in tuner . i seriously considered just buying the hd ready tv monitor and upgrade through my cable provider . boy am i glad that i did n't do that . if you are in the market for a very nice tv that is easy to use and provides a great picture , i would highly recommend this set .
1	( note to brian : the wap54g *can* be configured as a bridge . i have two of them in just such a configuration . took me about 10 minutes to set them up . ) major modes of operation are : 1 . wireless access point ( its default set-up ) 2 . wireless client ( connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the wap54g and you now have a wireless ethernet device ) 3 . wireless repeater ( extend range of wireless coverage ) 4 . wireless bridge ( connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a `` virtual '' cable ; you need two to get the job done ) a pair of wireless bridges is just what i needed but hesitated to buy the wap54g because of brian 's comment that this would n't work . because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that brian was wrong . i bought a pair and they do work . i rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons . 1 . i understand that higher-end , more expensive , equipment can be had with more range than this box . got ta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment ! 2 . one must dig very deeply into the users guide ( a pdf on the cd ) to find the default ip address in order to configure this device . luckily i had read elsewhere what that ip address is ( 192.168.1.245 ) . other manufacturers make this info readily available , even going so far as printing it on the device itself . this will be critical info to any linux user . also , the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is `` admin '' . well , it 's not . the only allowed userid is an empty field . this had me going for a few minutes . 3 . something that 99 % of the world wo n't care about -- i like to have more access to the firmware . for example other linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it 's attached to . i think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this
1	the best at this price . like the color and functions . mine has latest longer than some comparable higher end models . life saver when trying to keep a busy life organized . great optional backlight feature
0	i bought this adapter thinking i would be able to print documents from my pocketpc . i installed the adapter to my 6300 hp printer only to find out that you can only print images . i was not completely satisfied with this adapter
0	this dvr works ok . but when it is recording , forget about changing channels . it is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks . broadband feature is nice ; but usb does n't come cheap . its like [ ... ] .
0	horrible - the first time i slid my nano into the case it put several scratches on the front ; defeats the purpose for even buying it . i would recommend getting an agent 18 case .
0	received the product , it was not fully functional . the buttons worked but the mouse would not track . i loaded the software , trouble-shot everything , even put up with maddeningly insane questions from kensington tech support ( `` did you try unplugging it and replugging it back in ? '' ) however , amazon.com was very quick and gracious in the return . remarking on the design : seemed to fit well in my hand , though it was a bit bulky ; usb cord was very long -- a desktop user would not have any issues with its reach ; might have been an enjoyable product if it worked properly . i 'm a bit disappointed , i was always a fan of kensington products , starting with the 90s trackball . i also have a cordless optical notebook mouse . i 've been seeking a replacement b/c it chews through batteries like none other . so far i am 0-2 on satisfaction with kensington mice
0	agree with the prior message . i was duped into thinking 10 vhs tapes were being sold . do n't order this
0	we ordered this case/auto mount for our philips pet710 7 '' widescreen portable dvd player because it was the one recommended by amazon . i needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler . i eventually got this thing to work ( failure was not an option if you get my drift ) , but it has a number of drawbacks . -in order to mount it , you have to remove the top half ( huh ? ) . having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose . i accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when i drove away . -it 's too small . the philips portable dvd player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case . plus ( and this is really amazing ) , it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the dvd player . i have to carry the headphones and sleaved dvds seperately ! i chose my last dvd player b/c it came with an auto mount case , and even though i like the philips dvd player , i 'd do that again if i had it to do over . having the right case/mount for your dvd player is that key
1	like so many other small home office users , i have recently upgraded my network to 1000mpbs to help increase productivity . unfortunately , i originally purchased a gige 8 port switch from another mfg . that used a fan on their switch , a very noisy fan . after a month of listening to what sounded like an airplane engine , i tossed that unit and purchased this 8port netgear gige unit . it is silent . basically a plug and play item due to its unmanaged nature , i have had good data thru put and no problem . it comes with a small clip on stand for vertical storage if desired . the unit is finished in an attractive gray and chrome exterior . it is also small enough to live on a desktop with sucking up valuable real estate . so , if you are looking for a switch that will not be stored remotely in some closet , this is the one that will keep the peace in your office . a+ ****
1	great new product ! easy to use and turns my audio ipod into a portable media player . i can even use it to record my favorite tv shows . i highly recommend this product
1	this card is the 2 gb ultimate 120x it has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second . frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed , which is always much faster . analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second . that impacts time between pictures . for cameras , write speed is the most important , but the speed rating of the card does n't necessarily tell you its write speed . for music players and other devices , read speed may be more important . so you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures . i 'm currently shopping for sd cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes . in order not to slow the camera down , i need a fast card . i have done some research and realized that the reviews here are n't necessarily even related to this particular card , but are for all different sizes and speeds of kingston cards . kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings . this card is # 1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed
0	antec has dropped the ball on this one . my power supply came in doa . if you read reviews there are lots of reports of short life on power supply . the case weighs 25 pounds . it is a major hastle to uninstall everything and mail it back to california . it is a pretty case with some well thought out features , but not worth reliability hastles
1	i just added this to my onkyo htib system and it 's made all the difference in the world . i 'm a bit of an audiophile ( on a reasonable budget ) , with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10 '' polk in my truck . i 'm most satisfied with the polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess . i listen to a lot of music with double-bass drumming and thought that this psw12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10 '' sub i like so much . not the case . what i get is very quick bass with that ground-shaking impact that i always look for . i 'm still going easy on 'er for the break-in period , but i can say that the trailer for kingdom of heaven ( included on the blu-ray disc ) sounds absolutely stunning . paired with my 57 '' sony hdtv , trips to the movie theater are few and far between these days . now is a great time to pick up one of these , since the price seems to have recently dropped by about $ 50 throughout the web . unbeatable sub for the money !
1	not much to say here . it works . easily adjustable with just your feet . feels good wearing socks
0	the product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car . the mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it . i have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail . i will not purchase another thing from amazon until my money is refunded
0	i have the older , larger version of this product . however , it uses the same software . the labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great , but the software is awful . there is no direct macintosh program ; rather there are templates . they were written for old versions of software and really do n't work right . the windows side includes an actual print shop-style program which works awfully . if you do get this , make your own template on appleworks or powerpoint
1	great item . picture great , sound great , connection choices great . one problem : being located about a foot away from an under-cabinet radio , the presence ( shut off ) of this tv produces an annoying ratteling sound in the radio . to eliminate this sound you must unplug this tv from the power source ! or , optionally , move it at least three feet away , which in our case is not practical . very curious !
0	i bought this hoping it would cure my busted superdrive on my g4 imac but when connected via the firewire it would freeze any program i was using to burn cd 's or dvd 's . i thought it might have been a messed up product so i returned it to lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted . i then thought it was my computer , but the firewire ports worked when connected to my old ipod and even worked when connected to my lacie external hdd . finally figured that the product was defective after i purchased the sony drx-830 dvd burner and that burner worked perfectly when connected via firewire . this product however worked when connected on the usb port but the burning speeds were so slow that it was just about useless
0	this printer has been a piece of garbage since the day i bought it . i do n't know why i kept trying , as the purchase was made about a year ago . it should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and i would have cut my losses ( instead i did buy one more package of paper and ink . mistake . ) i have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message , turning the printer off , turning it back on , doing that several times , and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day . now it says the cartridge should be replaced , when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge ( and i have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures , which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge . i have printed about 6 . ) the ironic thing is , the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful . the one that i printed today was perfect . but several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours . this is the last time i try to use the printer , it is finally going in the trash
0	cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit . the included software does contain viruses . the included software is a reminate of the late 80 's to early 90 's . the tablet itself does not work under win2000 nor winxp . under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again . this unit would be great , if it came out 7 years ago . you get what you pay for
0	the sennheiser pmx70 had excellent sound quality and volume compared with others i 'd used recently . i had high hopes on first listen . however , these semi-in ear headphones were moderately uncomfortable after only about 20 minutes . i later took them on a 40 minute run . the design is such that in any position i adjusted them , the speakers tilted slightly upward in my ear . once i started perspiring , my sweat poured right into the little speakers . i had to stop every few minutes to shake the collected sweat out of the earpieces . the right speaker was filled with sweat and non-functional pretty much the entire run . who designed these ? consider these headphones only if you 1 ) never plan to exercise while using them and 2 ) will be keeping them on for 20 minutes or less
1	i agree that this drive can be a little slow , but it has n't caused a problem for me . i keep copies of many files ( about 1 gb total ) related to a large project at work on mine . when i first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes , but now i just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that i do n't even notice them ( just a second or two ) . i also seemlessly work on the files on both a pc at work and a mac at home . to me the best feature is the reliability . between my husband and i , we 've had several cruzer minis in various sizes and each one has worked great , even through accidental abuse . one of his 512 mb drives accidently went through the washing machine . we thought the data was gone , but when it dried out , it worked fine . just today i found my 2 gb drive at the bottom of the dryer ; it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and dryer . yep , it still worked ! i 'm buying a new one to replace it ( just in case ) because i do n't know it there might be some long-term effects from the water and heat , but i 'll keep using this one for less important applications . changes are good , though , that it 'll never have a problem . these things are amazingly reliable
0	most annoying thing is that i hooked up through hdmi for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the hdmi ( i used optical ) . what the hell is the deal with that ? at first i thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your tv or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well . hdmi is supposed to make it more convenient , 1 cable etc ... why is this necessary ? ? ? ? ? ? ? secondly my receiver is not working properly . the sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99 % of the time . running the auto macc fails out , manually i see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker ? ? ? ? ? nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part , surround left is silent as it should be . occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be . adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm . if i select the different output options , basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing . i am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as i do think the receiver is nice if its working , i enjoy the ipod dock that has output to your tv as well . i major concern is something is wrong with there hdmi circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well . i will update when i get the replacement installed .
0	i dont recommend these for 1st person shooter gamers . impossible to tell if enemy is in front or behind you . probably ok if direction of sound is not important to you . left and right work ok but not front/rear for some reason . my hp laptop earbuds work better
0	these blank discs are defective . i was never able to record any pictures or audio data to them . the maxell blank discs that i have did the job fine .
1	its really works fine for my items as well as my son 's toys . we both are happy with this
0	i purchased this item to record lps into my computer thru the input on this device . it sounded worse than recording through the mono microphone input that was built into my laptop . had same experience with loud right out of the box too - startled me out of my skin ! mine did n't come with any disk although the box mentions software . then again , i bought this from an amazon 'partner ' from amazon . spend your money wisely and get an imic . i 'm going to
0	i bought this unit for my wife and we received it this week . it works great . when i registered the unit on line i found that magellan 's website showed there were software updates for this unit ( roadmate 2000 ) . i downloaded the update and after some difficulty i was able to perform the upgrade . i then found that the voice prompts no longer worked . i logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct . i verified all of my settings and finally called magellan support . the support group was hard to understand ( they are located in india ) and were unable to help me . i asked if this was a problem related to the upgrade since the voice prompts worked fine before the upgrade and they would not say . they asked that i upgrade the unit again ( although the screen showing the firmware and os versions showed the new version numbers ) but by this time i was low on battery charge and could not perform the upgrade . this unit did not ship with an a/c adapter . i asked if there was a way to backout the upgrade and he ( tom ) informed me there was not . i asked the tech again if this was a known issue and what other issues i might experience with this `` upgrade '' and after some time on hold he once again was evasive and would not answer my questions . i asked for a supervisor and after some more time on hold he told me one would call me back within 24 - 48 hours . i was not happy with this and said that was unacceptable to which he put me on hold some more after i told him i thought 1 to 2 hours is more along my expectations . he came back and said a supervisor would call me back in an hour . it is well over an hour and no call so far . i tried their corp office and was routed by an aru back to india . i called their corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named marti who would not connect me to management . she said she would send me to quality assurance and they could escalate to management if necessary . i spent about 15 minutes on hold and was finally disconnected . i love the magellan gps units and i have three ( blazer 12 , explorist 210 and the roadmate 2000 ) and each time i have had to call tech support i am very disappointed . i have to say i will not recommend their products to anyone else since i am really getting the impression they are disconnected with their client base and provide at least some answers . to be fair tom ( tech support ) did say the updated firmware will be out within a weeks time . however , until then i have a nice map on a video device with no audible prompts whatsoever . if my wife was not already used to the unit i would pay 100 bucks more and get something by another manufacturer . in summary be careful with firmware upgrades and do n't expect good customer service if you need magellan 's help .
0	consider another receiver before buying delorme 's . delorme 's receiver works only with their software ( the receiver does not conform to any standard , unlike most other receivers . ) the delorme software itself is not very accurate . just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home , i found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly . finally , with the receiver i have , even after the device as been initialized , delorme 's software sometimes is unable to find it . ( i suspect that is because the cable on the gps side sometimes pulls slightly out , but fiddling with it does n't seem to accomplish much ) . real irritating out on the road , as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
1	works great ! ! ! i have a flat roof that does not allow me to add a phone line and the only way to use my satilite system is with a long phone cord accross my room . this jack extension helped me eliminate the long ugly cor
1	i agree with max . do n't use those inferior cables that come with your dvd player . i just bought a dvd player and immediately got these monster cables to connect between the tv and dvd . image quality is the best i can get on my 20 '' tv , really cool
0	i had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds . the sound quality was good , but the dependability of this item is questionable .
0	i ca n't say the reason , but this card blocks all the time , after some days without use . for unblock it , i have to take it out many times and clean contacts . then , without knowing exactly what worked , it begins to function .
0	first i rated it great and it was , for two movies . then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling . the end .
0	i 've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this cd , the sound from my system did seem to be a little better ( the cd 's were not skipping as much ) . but the bottom line is it did n't fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably , although not as bad as before . ... not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6-disk cd changer
0	i just bought these to compare to my pair of v20s , and they just suck in comparison . the bass is non existent in comparison , and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny . any sort of equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion . i 'm usually a fan of altec lansing products , but ... these look nice and are compact , but the sound is not good , at all . the fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling ...
1	just make sure you buy the right drive for your computer and download the software from western digitals website you should have no problems . very nice
1	not a bad product , but has very little bass response and the weather channel does not come in very well , no matter where the antenna is positione
1	solid product . headphone/speaker jack on my laptop died and manufacturer wanted $ 40 just to cover shipping fees to have it fixed ! i bought this great little unit instead for under $ 30 . good audio . actually , it saved my laptop once too , laptop fell from 2-3 feet but landed right on the rubberized turtle beach micro , which took most of the force . it was bent 90 degrees at the usb connector but it still worked ! proof of solid construction..
1	the azden transmitter-receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews . as an aspiring video maker it was a product i should have bought a long time ago . mine is the 9v-powered model , not the aa . but it has proven well-made , light and easy to use . there 's something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit . i find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping . being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience . another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise . the din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion ; using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information .
0	the radio for the boom box worked . the cd player did not work . i had to return it to be repaired or replaced . i do not have it back yet
0	i have used this _rw with my sanyo dvd recorder . the result is that i cound not play the recording . it wil freeze up . and some times they can not be formatted . they will not function well if they are used for the vr mode . i have used other brands such as tdk or fuji . they are ok .
1	i use this bag to carry my hp nc6000 business notebook . i have received many complements on this bag
0	before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12-in-1 : lexar and sandisk . i decided to buy lexar . i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick . i have 2 cards : 128 mb and 1 gb . i had no problem with 128 mb card . but i could not insert my gig card into this reader . it just did not go . i tried hard trying not to break the card - no success . it was a surprise for me . may be because my card was made not by lexar - by sandisk ... ? i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem . any way i had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 sandisk reader .
0	this printer does produce some fine output . that is when it works . the paper feed constantly refues to load paper . the film scanner should have been left off all together ( not worth using ) . i have been looking everywhere for a recall on this unit ( read alot of negative reviews ) . i have been a long time hp fan , but after this experience i am going to look elsewhere . my advice is to not even consider this printer
0	in general i 've been happy with belkin accessories , but this cable is the pits . it lasted less than a month ! i used it to connect my hd/dvr cable box to my receiver . no crimps , kinks , or undue stress on it , but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent . i do n't like to support the monster cable hype , but because of their lifetime warranty i bought their cable to replace this one . so far no problems
1	this card has all of the memory space required for my personal use . i would recommemd it to others
0	this is the worst thing i have ever owned ! ! ! ! it broke ( said there were no cd 's inside ) after about a week ! do yourself a favor do n't get this product , do n't buy this brand and do n't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too
1	one of the few of these type of items available on the market . i bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews . i had received some free drives from newegg ( seagate ) and needed to house them . this was a no brainer set up . the utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off . ( xp pro sp2 ) . the firmware was one rev prior so i updated it - absolutely smooth as silk . reformatted the drives . i chose the raid 1 option and ext3 format . i like the fact that you can specify raid size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume . the drive is fairly solid . the fan is not very noisy . the front slide up access door is a little kludgy . good user interface . i was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen raid and ext3 . the only thing i can never get to work and it is 100 % my lack of knowledge is the email alerts . i could n't get infrant to do it and same with this one . as an aside i love amazon and newegg . great retailers both of them
0	i was hopeful about using this mouse for gaming , and its response time did deliver . it is more precise in it 's cursor control than any other mouse i 've used . however , it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me . i find it 's side buttons are difficult to use . they 're very small and their action is not to my liking . further , i was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using mac os x tiger . the steer mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons . i 've found nothing that supports those buttons on the mac platform to date
0	i was tempted by the low price of this item . the only reviewer before me gave it a 5-star rating . although aware of the unreliability of a single review , i decided to gave it a shot , and paid $ 10 for shipping -- no other way since it 's sold through a third party . $ 28 later , i was holding the biggest $ # ! * i 've seen in a while ! the construction feels very cheap , and the instruction manual makes absolutely no sense as if written by a 3-year old . and the worst of all , only one of the two microphones worked . even the one that works is horrible -- the sound out of the speaker is very weak unless you cup your hand around your mouth and the mic . it uses a 9-volt battery in each of the two mics , and that 's another 5 bucks out of my pocket . you know what ? i 'll probably have to eat the $ 33 , since the seller does not refund any shipping charges and charges a hefty fee for returns . well , i learned a lesson ... things are cheap for a reason
1	i 've had this card for about 1 1/2 years now and it has performed flawlessly . it has seen thousands of photos ( no exaggeration ! ) on my digital camera and now holds data/mp3s for my palm too . did you know you can pop your sd card out of a camera and into a palm to view photos ? i just learned this . anyway it 's a nice product and i 'm about to get another simpletech with 512 megs or higher if they have one . if you are new to sd memory , always get more storage than you need because eventually you 'll buy something that will use one ( camera , handhelds , cell phones , etc . -- note that many cell phones use a smaller `` minisd '' )
1	i was a little worried about spending almost 70 $ on this bag , but when i recieved it i was so impressed . i really love this bag ! very well made ! ! the crocadile pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows , but i really like it . to be honest i shy away from croc patterns , but it really works with this bag ! i have a 15.4 in . gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag
0	i bought this phone based on a review in wired magazine . i love their reviews usually , but this one really let me down . i read another customer 's review ( i forget where ) saying they had sound quality problems , but i thought yeah right ... one in a million . well i bought the phone and had the exact same experience . very poor sound/voice quality . it sounded worse than a cell phone in an underground wind tunnel . i can not imagine why . i charged the battery for 48 hrs , i had it on a separate circuit , and it had it 's own line . i plugged in an old ge 2,4 ghz phone an whamo ... no troubles what so ever . needless to say , i took the phone back and bought a cheap desk phone with a cord . sometimes you do n't get what you pay for
0	believe me , this is not worth it ! get a kensington . i already wasted my money on this , do n't buy it . horrible signal to noise ratio , poor reception , can not modulate to more than 4 frequencies . does not work
1	the first ipod clock radio i bought was an emerson itone that was very disappointing . after returning it , i did a bunch of research , and decided to order the i177 ( white ) . i am very happy with the unit . the sound is great . while it is not a bose , it sounds way better than your average alarm clock . the controls are very intuitive and simple to use . i have a 4th generation ipod , and it fit perfectly . another great feature is the display dimmer . you can turn the backlight completely off , a feature not found in many other products . a common complaint i read about for other brands of radio was that the display would light up the room ! not a problem with this unit . the remote control is pretty neat too . i like the fact that i can control my ipod remotely . there are 2 separate alarms , which is nice if your significant other has to get up at a different time . the only lacking feature is the ability to store radio stations . this would be nice , but i bought this unit to wake to my ipod so i ca n't complain . overall this thing is great .
0	i have only had the batteries for a short time , but they are working great . i have recharged all three sets `` 4 per set '' three times each . ( that 's what taks to run my canon powershots2/i2 camera ) all good news.i take a lot of pictures and i need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours.but i know that i need another 3 sets to really keep me in the field for the day . i do alot of back packing and long walks on the beaches.these batteries are really good they have never let me down as of yet , that 's why i will be getting more . all i can really say is byem
1	i bought the sansa m240 two months ago and am quite happy with it . it 's light-weight , holds plenty of media ( i have yet to fill it up ) and the sound is suprisingly good . no complaints
1	i got the griffin itrip to enjoy my ipod in my car , and then i had to get a belkin tunebase for ipod mini ! with the short battery life that is further aggravated when using the itrip , the tunebase keeps my ipod charged so that i do n't have to plug it into my computer 's usb port every night after work
1	i recently purchased the pacific breeze laptop cooler and so far am very impressed with it . now this review should be taken with a grain of salt , because i have only had the cooler for a few weeks , but i feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate . the reason that i was in search of a cooler was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps . i installed notebook hardware control ( free temperature and power control utility ) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55c at my hard drive ! worried about how this would affect the hard drive 's longevity , i started looking around at coolers . i choose this cooler after reviewing several of the `` mat '' variety , but chose this one because of its design . as the previous reviewers have already mentioned , this cooler elevates the notebook from the rear and blows air under the notebook . this allows the cpu fan intake and hard drive to receive plenty of fresh air . after setting this cooler up , i was feeling pretty good about the purchase . qualitatively , the results are evident by a cooler notebook top and keypad , and the feel of air exiting the sides of the notebook . quantitatively , the notebook experienced a 5c temperature drop at my hd and at my cpu . now my hard drive is running at 40c-45c instead of 45-50c ! i would definitely recommend this product
0	very disappointing ! i was hoping i could at least get one or two viewable network affiliate vhf stations . instead , the best the antenna could pull in was color-enhanced snow and sound laced with static . tried all three antenna hook-up options . in fact , my set pulled in the same signal with or without the antenna
0	[ ... ] the mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse . i have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse . this is not it . unfortunately with this one , the sensor does n't stand still . my screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there , the arrow jumps in all directions about 2-3 arrow spaces around . do n't be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse . my old optical was better .
0	in my opinion : i own a ton of panasonic equipment , most recently a dvd recorder . i was using sony dvd-rs with no problems , but , being a panasonic person , i figured panasonic must be better . in order to save a few bucks , i joined the panasonic club at the panasonic website , and ordered a spindle of these same type dvd-rs . i did this on 9/20/06 . i made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were , and , believe it or not , nobody at panasonic could tell me why they had n't been shipped . then , i was promised that they did ship , but i never got them . after being talked into placing a duplicate order by a panasonic rep , i did n't get that order either . i finally received one order on 10/16/06 . they were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken . now , i finally had my discs . guess what ? they were only 1-8x speed ( the sony discs were 1-16x speed ) , and my thermal label printer would n't print on them because of the finish . i had been assured that i could print on them with a thermal printer . i did burn a couple of movies , and they worked , but i saw nothing special that i can report . it gets worse : i logged into my panasonic club account , and saw two charges i had n't made : one for $ 10,017 and one for $ 915 . i fell off the back of my chair . to this day nobody has called me , but i managed to get some email responses , and i was told i would have to watch my credit card - that 's just what i need ! you know , sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a company it is , and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were . i 'm going back to sony , and let me tell you , amazon customer service blows away just about every company i 've dealt with ( sorry about the preposition ) . i should have bought on amazon .
1	the product works great . what i did n't like was not having the attachment to charge the battery in my home . it only came with the cigarette lighter power source . i had to purchase the other power source seperately . i also had purchased the 3000 model previously and it came with both power sources . why is that
0	this card is such a disappointment . it is soooo sloooooow . i use it for my digital camera , mp3 player , and ipaq . it takes forever to copy anything to and from it
1	if you own a canon digital camera this printer is great . it is portable and makes great prints . people think they are from a photolab . it is also vey easy to use . i have seen other mini printers from olympus and sony and they are not as good . they cost more too
0	i bought the zune around christmas time of 2006 . i used it on a daily basis and was happy with it . early in april , it stopped working . after spending three ( 3 ) hours on the phone with four ( 4 ) technicians , microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility . two ( 2 ) weeks later , i received the zune back with a note that the zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations . they did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it . i was more then dismayed . i had spent almost $ 300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product . i did not abuse it in any way . please think twice before buying this product . if and when it breaks - microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a $ 300.00 paperweight .
0	the transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do
0	i bought this item because amazon never had the 3m model i wanted in stock . so i settled for this one . that was a big mistake . the wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your cpu very unstable . the spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the cpu . it is really a two person operation . finally , if your cpu has a side access panel , you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer . take a look at the 3m cs100 stand . i think it is a much better design
0	along with reception of new hd stations i expected high quality fm am to go with my complete top line stereo system . instead , the hdt-1 gives me very poor quality , even less than a table-top clock radio . very high output - can only turn amp up to lowest level - and painful to listen to . no response to inquiries from sangean .
1	an outstanding platform for windows mobile operating system . flawless syncing with home/office desktop . clear , high resolution screen is a joy compared to my previous palm based pda 's . wireless functioning is reliable and seamless . ergonomics are excellent . good to above average batery life with power saver options . would highly recommend this product
1	the cable set that comes in this item is what ought to have been included in the airport express . this comes with a 2 meter rca-ministereo , a 2 meter optical-ministereo , and a 6ft power cable . i found that both the rca and optical cables worked flawlessly with my receiver . i wish that the power cable was a little longer and i would 've liked to have received a white ethernet cable to complete this set . the installation of any of these cable went very easily with the on caveat that you must ensure to remove the covers on the optical cable which may not be obvious to some
1	i had great hope for this product . it has , mostly , so far , lived up to my expectations . here are some caveats ... i was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories ... easy listening , dinner music , light jazz ... etc . you have to `` cheat '' to do this , and using the manual is daunting . instead of using the `` artist '' as artist , i used it as a catagory code , ie making one artist light jazz , etc . this works , but you do , of course lose the artist registration ability . so now , i can select `` artist '' `` dinner music '' and then `` all discs '' and `` shuffle '' , and the unit will play a track from one `` dinner music '' cd then shuffle to another track on another `` dinner music '' cd , etc , making a delightful , mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way . i am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine , so longetivty , and flawlessness are not being reviewed here . that remains to be seen . the manual is purely awfull . just dig in and try things . that 's the only way to get a handle on things . hope this helps ... .good luck !
1	for this price these are a steal ! purchased mine for $ 15 ( with shipping ) and let me tell you , it was worth it ! the headphones come with a 1/4 converter too ! so you can use them for cd players and amps ! the sound quality is good , and the headphones do n't hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours . these are an amazing deal for the price , i 'm honestly surprised these ar n't marked for $ 50 . do n't pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones
0	was a little hard putting it together . you have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart . i am not happy with this product
1	this product is perfect for anyone who has a thumb drive but no lanyard or other item already attached to it . i could not find anything like this at any of the big stores i.e . circuit city , hh gregg , etc . i hopped online and found this right away ... thanks
1	they do n't collapse , so they are n't the most easily portable as you sure are n't putting them in your pocket . you also are n't listening to music in bed with them , as mentioned in other reviews , the back is not adjustable and will push the vertical facing speakers out of your ears . i tend to collect lower end headphones , and why not . so , i do have a unique perspective on them ( or so i say , mostly to flatter myself ) . these , compared to other vertical designs , are good . the sound is better than most . not quite as good as the sony h.ear line , but those would never stay in my ears and when dangling they are literally tangle hooks . these p9 's are simple , one piece , and very smartly the cord only comes up to one ear . the volume adjustment makes them nice for tv and computer use . also , if you ever listen while using a splitter , make sure the other person is wearing the cans ( or whatever more power consumptiony headphones ) so you can cut your volume . my wife wears cans when watching tv , so when i just must watch some witty sonic commercial , i just plug myself in . they are n't perfect . i 'd like to also try the sennheiser vertical over the head cheapos as well as the sony folding ones . they did come in very handy when my scroll wheel on my rio carbon was broken ( only volume control on the thing ) . for reference , my everyday buds are sony ed21lps , which i highly reccomend for all purpose use as they wont fall out , and can be stored in a very small area . heck , i even use the stupid pouch that comes with them . but , yeah , knowing the weaknesses of the p9 , if you think you 'd like it , then you 'll love it
1	my wife and i have maybe a dozen or so devices connected via wifi spread throughout our four-bedroom home . among these were an avaya 4610sw sip ( voip ) phone and a pc serving as an asterisk server ( asterisk is an open source pbx ) . this configuration has worked well for a couple of years now . in the past few months i 've been having occasional disconnects of voip calls coming in to asterisk from the pstn . after some investigation , i decided to move my phone and server off wifi and onto a homeplug network , using the electrical wiring as another ethernet . the hardest part of the installation was freeing up an electrical outlet in my second-floor office where my phone is , in the basement where the server is , and in the family room on the first floor where the linksys wifi router/access point is located . after that , it was just a matter of plugging in an ethernet cable from the netgear box to the router , and moving the ethernet cables from the wifi boxes for the phone and server to the netgear boxes . it was that simple . [ ... ] i wish all high-tech equipment were this easy to install
0	i bought this card and the belkin pre-n wireless router in nov. 2006 at a bestbuy store during thanksgiving sale . the router worked but the card did not . i called belkin many times . everytime they asked me to re-install the drivers and software for the card but the card never worked . i wasted more than 4 hours on phone and re-installing drivers again and again . then finally belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacement . i pointed out that i should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs . i have shipped them the defective card today and am awaiting a replacement to arrive
0	this keyboard folds out well and i liked the feel of the keys . however , the ir connector needs to be in direct connection with the ir port in the pda . for the ipaq , this port is at the bottom of the handheld . the 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area . in order to have the proper connectivity , you have to turn the handheld on its side . this then requires another software program download ( not freeware that i can find ) to rotate your screen to the landscape view , unless you can read sideways without getting a headache . before buying this product , check your handheld to see if your ir port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so , this may be a difficult keyboard to use
0	the battery packs in these walkie talkies last for about an hour only- i am very disappointed in the quality . we need them for emergencies throughout the day- this is a farmed animal sanctuary- non-profit and we can not afford to purchase new batteries after paying for these already . i am willing to change my review if we get new batteries . they came on time- they are good quality- other than the batterie
1	ordered directly from hp . fast delivery , solid package . no dead pixel . works perfec
1	after using my im716s for about 4 months now i have a few things to say about them . 1 ) price : lists for $ 199 on altec 's site . $ 70 is a steal . 2 ) quality : top notch in the earphones , the clip on the volume module is weak . 3 ) performance : bar none best i 've had . these things outperform the huge logitech ear muff set i use mainly to mow in . these things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower . 4 ) conclusion : the only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way . when moving around , you need to have it clipped to something , otherwise it can create inner ear noise . this can get quite annoying . i 've also caught the cord on things , causing the clip to bend away from the module . it is removeable and i was able to bend it back . if there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module , even for the same price , i 'd go that route . with that said , i am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60gb video ipod
1	i owned a bose wave radio for a number of years . the price was well beyond my financial means , but i made the sacrifice , and i 'm very glad i did . the sound defied belief , and i was very pleased . you will be , too . forget the detractors herein . they know nothing , like the `` reviewer '' who listened to am radio . if the sound of frying eggs is appealing to you , then , any radio will suffice . but if a clear sound is what you 're going for , then go buy a bose wave radio ! you 'll be glad you did . i know that i am
0	this is a cheap cable in both cost and quality . when connected between my voodoo3 3000 card and my mag innovision dx17f monitor , the picture quality was poor , with severe `` ghosting '' of the screen . this cable does not have the cylinders on each end as most monitor cables do . i assume the lack of these cylinders is what causes the degradation in signal quality
0	this item was not practical . it looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
1	bought these to use while doing my daily walks mowing . they work 100 % better than the little `` lipstick '' antenna you get with the myfi plus you do n't have to use the earphones . the only time i lose signal is if i 'm really boxed in an area that does n't face south . it actually works in some areas inside my house . the sound quality is good enough for a casual audiophile like me . besides , there ai n't much in the way of other options . this is my second pair because my first pair had the left channel crap out because of a broken wire after a year . so i use them as an extra antenna in the kitchen when i want to use the fm tuner on the radio
0	i bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it . the first unit i received would not turn on at all . i contacted philips ' tech support , and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense . fortunately , amazon has a very nice return policy , and i sent it back to them instead . amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit . the replacement stereo arrived in short order , and i was immediately disappointed in the sound quality , which did n't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that i was replacing . after listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a sony cmt-ne3 bookshelf stereo that i own , here are my thoughts . 1 . the fm reception is not as good as the cmt-ne3 . both units have a thin wire type of antenna , and both wires are about the same length . the philips stereo , however , would hiss and crackle as i moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception . this did not happen with the sony stereo . 2 . the sound quality is not as good as the cmt-ne3 . playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos , i found that the philips stereo had a flat , tinny sound when compared to the cmt-ne3 . the sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality . also , there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the philips stereo , making `` s '' sounds sound more like `` h '' sounds . i also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound , possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input . 3 . the ergonomics of the philips stereo are not so good . for one thing , the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped . if that happens , the cd can get wedged in the cd tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove . the electronically actuated cd door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading cmt-ne3 . the volume goes up to 31 or so , but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening . this means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels , which is rather limiting . finally , the stereo is a bit bigger than i was expecting ( though i could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it ) . i am in the process of returning this stereo , and i will try to find a sony system instead . unfortunately , amazon no longer sells the cmt-ne3 , which i bought just about a year ago . i do n't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly . is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos ? the only difference between the sony i bought last year and one i bought in 1989 is the ability to play mp3 cds .
0	this would be a nice printer . if only i could get it to print ! not to mention when i turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed . i 've tried over and over to try to print something . i 've checked my options , turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing . if your looking for a portible printer you have other options and i suggest using them
1	i am so satisfied with this product that i had to come back and write a review on this . it has good picture quality and sound quality is amazing ! battery lasts very long which is very very useful n important feature for portable players . i love to watch movies on this and also love to connect this to my tv and watch on a big screen any place i go
1	i purchased the transmitter because i do n't have an aux input in my car . the product works well . i live in an area that is crowded with stations and the transmitter still provided a strong enough signal to override weak stations and provide near quality audio . one review mentioned the sansa player wo n't fit in the transmitter with the silicon case on . i use the silicon case to protect my player . i took off the belt clip that comes with the case . the player and case fits well enough in the transmitter .
1	it 's a good phone , works well . i like the caller id function buttons being a different color than from the rest of the phone , makes them easier to see use . it has good sound a ring tone that does n't jangle the nerves . the only problem i had with it is that the cord goes directly into the phone one must use the cord that the phone comes with , rather than one already in use . i purchased an adapter so that i could plug it into an extension phone cord because we needed to put it some distance from the wall jack . not a big deal in my book but one i did n't learn about until i got the phone . overall i am pleased with it
1	this performs better than the unit offered at the apple store at about 20 % of the cost ! plus it has an indicator light and the folding plug is handy for travel . good deal
0	whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point . there is no point in havng one vpn client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client . it would be similar to , say , allowing people to just access one web site on the internet . in my case i already had two vpn clients related to work when i installed a netgear router with vpn capabilities on my home network . the vpn software from netgear stops my other vpn clients working . added to my woes i ca n't tell you how often i saw 'the blue screen of death ' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts . i am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution
1	i purchased this product 2 years back and it is still working without any problem . i use the batteries mostly for my digital camera and have no complaints so far . highly recommend this product
0	i use a plastic water bottle and the only part that is kept cold is the bottom .
0	bought 4 ! they do n't work . the batteries do not last . we are trying to return them
1	this was the perfect tv for our needs : it fits the space , is economical , has great picture size and quality , and lots of features . it is a good blend of current digital and crt technology . not an lcd and bulky as they come , but once in place it delivers a quality viewing experience .
0	do n't waste your money ! i have directv with hd ( 5 lnb ) and the signal was low . signal was less than 60 % for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching hd . so i bought these to amplify my satellite signal . they actually attenuated the signal . the signal strength was n't improved on the non hd receivers that i have as well . it did n't matter where i put them in relation to the dish and receiver .
0	the user interface was horrible . the product documentation was even worse . i still ca n't figure out how to perform a regular scan , no ocr . this was poorly designed , poorly supported . get some other scanner , this one is impossible
0	the `` lp-to-digital recording system '' is nothing more than a record player . just a vanilla , run-of-the-mill record player . you still need a sound card in order to record your lps . most builtin ( on the motherboard ) sound cards have very poor audio input , so this product is not suited to its advertized function . i am reminded of the `` solar clothes dryer '' product of a couple of years back - the box contained a rope and some clothespins . the software is awkward and hard to use , not at all intuitive . it also requires the user to register on the net and donate their privacy . any buyer would be better off getting audacity ( freely available on the net ) , which is easy to use and has the same features . i do not recommend this product .
1	these dvds are probably the highest quality and most reliable that i have tried . and given their low price , what is there not to like ? i would recommend these to just about anyone
0	a virtual nightmare with set up . no help from their support staff on phones , nor online q poorest choice i ever have made in a product ! ! i am a savvy computer type with network experience and this one for the books . item still sitting where i left it ... ... . , useless
1	just some specs missing from amazon 's description : usb 2.0 compactflash reader small and travels with ease led status indicator indicates when files are being transferred data transfer speeds up to 480mb/s backward compatible with usb 1.1 ships with removable usb 2.0 cable features designed for large data transfers , like images , music and video data transfer 5 to 6 times faster than using usb 1.1 portable - weighs only 1.5 ounces protective cover case keeps reader pins away from external hazards compatible with windows 2000/me/xp and mac os x and 9.1 no drivers required with most current operating systems 2-year limited warranty
1	this has been an excellent purchase . well worth the price . excellent color and clarity
0	this thing does n't work , nothing but black and white image and off center . my video card is ntsc like it said but wo n't work on the 3 computers i have . do n't buy this , buy a video converter box
0	bought these to use with the xm myfi . they are not comfortable to use . they put pressure on your ears . now the good news , they do get decent reception , i tried them in my office in nyc which has a northern exposure and it got good reception
0	this product has the potential to be tremendous , but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched . that absolutely ruins the ipod video experience , now that there is lcd glare exposing all the scratches . also , there is a big 'rhigo-skin ' logo on the front , which makes the case even that more distracting . i 'm sure that it is n't polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail . what a letdown . p.s . if you are buying the 30gb version of this case , it will double the thickness of your setup
1	if you 're looking at this page you probably already know a lot about hp calculators . chances are you either had a 32sii and do n't want to go the ebay route or wan na slim down from that 48/49 series because you do n't really need that extra functionality . is the 33s perfect ? no , not by a long ways , but it 's the best thing we 've got . if you want a new scientific rpn calculator this is it .
0	this is the only card that has ever failed to work on my palm tungsten c , so i know it 's not a hardware problem with my pda . the handheld device recognizes the card and filez shows that the programs and databases are present and available , but the program does n't run -- the only response i get is `` loading from card . please wait . '' but nothing happens . my repeated queries to tech support via its web site have gone unanswered . do n't count on any help from the company if you also get a lemon
0	amazon recommends the $ 59 apple protection plan for the ipod shuffle -- 2nd generation -- -- be advised the apple store offers a $ 39 2yr plan for just the ipod nano 2nd gen and ipod shuffle 2nd gen . both plans work great , if you have one of these two new machines save yourself $ 20
1	i agree with the comments posted here . like most of us , i was interested in the bose sound yet put off by the prestige price . even on e-bay the going price ended up being around $ 400 -- for a used older model . so i did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison-shopper article that put the bose up against several competitors , including this high-end teac . i have to say that i 'm entirely satisfied . the chrome retro look is quite appealing , and the model has a couple of features that , for me , beat out bose entirely . i wanted a top-loading door like the old bose models but also the ability to play mp3 like the new ones , and this gave me both . the sound and punch is remarkable . at flat setting , it is a bit bassy , that 's true , but you get a -5 to+ 5 range for both bass and treble adjustment : i set mine at -3 and +1 respectively and am very happy with the sound in my bedroom . input and alarm functions are limited but not problematic . 10 presets can be cycled though quickly enough , and just remember to set it to a station ( or load a cd ) that you 'd want to be woken up to before calling it a night ! teac customer service i ca n't comment on , but i bought a reconditioned unit from an amazon seller for less than $ 100 , including shipping . a sweet deal for a sweet machine .
1	i love the jlab miniblaster because no matter where i go i can have my favorite music with me . the sound is clear and i found this product easy to use . i will be giving several of these for holiday gifts and birthday presents to friends and relatives , young and old . the delivery was prompt , and i appreciated the friendly customer service in response to my questions
0	i really tried to like the via michelin , bought it with every intention of loving it in march 2007 . but i feel compelled to tell most of you to `` keep shopping . '' i bought it due to the excellent price , small thin size ( compared to garmin ) . i thought `` how bad can it be ? '' i ordered it and had it shipped to my door , then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it . this is because my other gps units were in other cars , with other family members already on other trips . i bought this one as a budget gps , optimistic that it was new and had the sirf-iii chip . but before long , i hated this unit , all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me , and i will tell you about it below . first , please note there are a few positive reviews for this unit ... .but have you noticed they are mostly all people who have no experience with `` other '' gps units ? or they did n't spend much time with it before they reviewed it ? or they have n't had experience with gps in 4 years..which is like a century in terms of how fast this technology is changing ? for positive reviewers , if this is their first `` newer '' gps and if they are comparing it to a car navigational gps of 4 years ago , then yes , it is quite a bit better . but compared to the new units like mio 310x or the tom tom one ( both of which i own ) then the viamichelin has a `` horrible '' user interface , and is horrible to use on the roads . tomtom and mio , often finish what you are typing for you , they are intuitive and programmers have polished them . but the viamichelin is very non intuitive , absolutely dangerous to try to use on the fly . sure , we are not supposed to use them while we drive , and with this one it is truly dangerous even when you learn the complicated system . so most of the time , you have to pull over and work on it . but it is no fun , and even you program it , if you go to another screen it `` loses '' it and you have to program the history all over . you will soon be frustrated with how many steps this unit takes to do anything , and how `` lost '' it often gets . i will try to give you the pros : pros : small form factor , decent screen , sirf 3 chip . navteq maps . four hour battery life . good price for a sirf-3 chip unit . cons : horrible non intuitive software program , clunky , multi step interface that will make your life horrible if you are in a rush or emergency ... or even if you are not in a hurry . horrible speaker..volume so poor and speaker so poor , you ca n't hear it with any road noise present ... seriously ... turn speaker up all the way while driving..it will crackle and is illegible . i read this in a review , but honestly did n't believe it until i owned it . third , unlike any gps i 've had , this one literally tells you to `` start driving '' before it can tell you which way to go , when you 've routed it to the nearest store , etc . think about that ! it means sometimes you have a 50 % chance of making the right choice as to which way to go ... then if you guess wrong , it tells you to turn around and go the other way ! seriously ... that one feature should be enough to make you say `` no '' as most gps will at least tell you to `` turn right '' from where you are parked or `` turn left '' but this one will say `` start driving '' without any direction ... .because it ca n't seem to route until you drive onto a road . it ca n't do it from a parking lot ! it already will have the satellite location ... that 's not it..it 's a software bugaboo i think built into the programming . it makes you `` start driving '' because it ca n't find your location or know which way you are going..until you start and it routes the direction you are traveling . bad software design for sure . when you go to canada , you have to have installed ( on another sd card ) the canadian map ... .very inconvenient when you cross the border . navteq maps could not find many locations on coastal maine . literally , we were driving on coastal roads it said did not exist . i found it very slow recalculating trips when you missed a turn ( much slower than my mio 310 which was purchasd last year , or tom tom one which was purchased this year ) and this recalculation problem in busy city traffic , caused us to miss several critical exits . want to find poi 's on the run ? forget it . too many steps and illogical organization compared to other major brands . it often could not find even local walmarts ... one 's that have been there for 20 years . i 'm serious . i parked in front of walmarts that it could not find ... very old walmarts . to be sure , garmin , tomtom and mio do not list all walmarts , but at least they get 4 or 5 out of 7 in my home town . not so via . in several towns in maine and connecticut , i parked in front of rows of old stores that had been there for years . punch in local stores on the difficult to use poi list , and it ca n't find any of them . also , punch in or look for stores like nearest walmart ... .mio and tom tom had no problems finding several..or the nearest ones it knew about from your location . but with via , it has to be within a certain distance from you..or it will not show up as existing . so ... .you then have to figure out the next town and search from that location , to try to find the store . very , very clunky ... .ca n't tell you how much trouble that is . it 's so simple on the other units , you get spoiled with the garmin or tomtoms . this one makes it so hard and still ca n't find the poi 's . no gps finds all stores ... .there is a limit on poi 's , of course . but it seems the via programmers spent their time gathering addresses for bank atm 's and not restaurants , shopping , etc . believe me , once you 've used it on a trip , it 's organized to make you believe the programmers never actually used a gps themselves before . i ca n't say enough about how `` difficult '' the interface is ... .and when you go `` back '' or `` forward '' to another screen , it often loses where it is ... and you have to start all over again programming where you are going , going through multiple difficult steps . when you lose power , again , you start all over . when i bought it , i read some of the negative and positive reviews and thought ... .how bad can it be ? i thought the complaining people are probably not techie and are complaining for no reason . wrong ! the experienced gps users are the ones that know just how clunky and bad this software interface is compared to the sleek garmin or tom tom interfaces . example : on one trip , my daughter began to throw up , and we had to find an emergency medical treatment facility ... .this clunky interface made it very difficult to locate one . when you are panicked , you want to quickly find the nearest hospital . this unit makes you put in the town , etc . if you are further than x miles or so ... like when you are on the interstate ... .so you are literally guessing which town to search to find a hospital . which is horrible . i had this happen before and with the mio , about 3 clicks and bam you have searched and found the nearest hospital ... one more click and you are routed to the nearest hospital . truly , i am sad to not recommend the viamichelin . i really recommend you `` pass '' like some other reviewers have suggested . and i recommend you to buy the more rapid , easy to use mio with the great screen , blazing fast sirf 3 and calculating chip , and loud-clear-speaker . if you are tech challenged , buy the garmin or tomtom 's with their awesome and easy to use software interface . but do n't buy this bad speakered , horrible interfaced , poorly designed , buggy unit . on paper , it looks like a killer unit . but in reality , it is an unpolished clunky paper tiger that is horrible to use . finally , there is the `` fun '' factor . the tomtom one is fun . the mio is fast and fun , a pleasure to use ! even the newer garmin 's are fun with their simplicity ( i hated the screen on some of the old garmins . ) but the viamichelin x-930 has no fun programmed in ... .it is not a pleasure to use , although it will take you across country . believe me , the pleasure of the low price will quickly fade once you start working with the unhearable speaker , unpolished , unfun , clunky , interface with poorly organized features and disorganized poi 's and menus . the polished quick intuitive menu is where garmin and tomtom shine . the only thing better on the viamichellin is the screen and sirf-chip ... some of the older garmin 's use an older satellite gps chip than the viamichellin , but new tomtom 's and via use the same gps satellite chip , but faster software routines and cpu chips . but even the use of the sirf-3 chip on the via michelin , can not make up for the poor software and menu design . theoretically , this thing should be blazing fast , but it is much slower than my tomtom or mio . the only thing better on this unit than the mio , is that the via is smaller and thinner . and maybe the navteq maps might be slightly better for some locals . but other than that , the mio wins hands down , by far a faster , better and easier to use gps in my opinion . if you are looking for software ease , go garmin first , then tom-tom , then mio , and via last . if you are looking for value in a great unit then go with the mio 310x , it 's a killer unit and it 's hackable . but if you are looking for simplicity i programming where you are going , go with garmin first , then tom-tom . i tried you mr. viamichelin , but you need to go to `` finishing school '' like the other gps students . you are just too unfinished and rough
0	the sound was great , but the dvd would lag every 10-15 seconds during any and all movies . it drove me nuts . i had to return it .
1	if you are looking for an inexpensive ipod , then i would recommend this .
0	this is a good product - sounds great , gets good battery life , everything you 'd hope for in an ipod dock . but it has one major flaw . the ipod docking port is really flimsy , and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves . after a little bit of use , the connection between the ipod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down , and sometimes the sound cuts out all together . if they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the ipod would n't stress the electronics , i 'd give this thing 5 stars . but without that , it simply breaks quickly , and no longer performs its only job - to sound good .
0	i purchased the 8gb creative zen v plus player during the first week in february . i am returning it and this is why : the package arrived from amazon . i loaded up the software on my computer , then hooked up the player through the usb cord . i let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state . then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player . so after the music was loaded , i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music . the sound quality was good , the player is easy to navigate in the menus , etc ... the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player . i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there . so i plugged the player back into the usb cord , and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer . the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player . i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there . then i accessed through the computer just fine . all my songs , all 4,500 of them , are in mp3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs i ripped from cd 's . the player just would n't read about half my songs . there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize . i would load an entire album of 15 songs and i could only play 6 or 7 tracks . this happened with my entire music collection . so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update . it did not solve the problem . i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my 3 year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine . i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service . it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why . they have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company i have ever spoke with . after three calls , never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language , more like a 3rd or 4th language , i arrived nowhere . they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem . no email ever came , checked the junk folder and every other possible place . so i tried a fourth call . this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand , saying `` i ca n't believe you americans '' and then mumbled something in another language . i asked for a supervisor . he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days . then he hung up . i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature . they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way . so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also do n't plan on buying anything from creative again . by the way , after all this , the problem never was fixed . also , when doing research on this product , i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files . this is not true . this player will not play any files without being converted first . i took an avi video that was 100mb and it converted it into a 1.2gb file . the format they use is absolutely a waste of space . if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format , it will end up taking the entire 8gb of space if not more . i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie . i was wrong , the movie took up 7.1gb after being converted . i would not recommend this product to anyone . as much as i do n't like the ipod , i would recommend it over the zen v plus because : 1 . it plays all my music 2 . they have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers . i hope this helps anyone looking at this player . jeff
0	the cd payer is made of what feels like a cheap plastic . the cassette adapter was broken after 10 seconds of use . so i called coby . they said i 'd have to pay them to send me a replacement ! my advice , do n't bother buying coby
1	great portability , good picture for the price . i like the fact that i can plug this player into any tv and play dvd 's and also take it in the car , camping or anywhere . i also purchased a small set of external speakers which will really improve the sound . onboard speakers a little lacking but overall a great value
0	true to its name it has high sensitivity . too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live.start moving in all directions . on my couch the mouse is dead . if the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive . but when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck . the paws/foot of the mouse is sticky . not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse ... . i am returning this product . even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen .
1	i 've seen others coaster from day 1 and i 've seen others coaster after day 60 ( after an actual succesfull write ! ) but these are absolutely awesome . highly reliable ... long-term
1	a lot of tv for little money . great picture , and the refresh rate is fast enough to prevent most of the blurring that you tend to see on low end lcd 's . initial setup can be tricky because olevia chose to include a cd version of the operators manual , though you can print a paper version from the cd or olevia website . better than average sound , but the side speakers add a bit to the overall width . after tweaking the factory settings we achieved a nice color balance without any of the black level problems that plague many lcd 's . if you 're using it in a bedroom you 'll most likely be annoyed by the very bright on/off light on the front panel . rear panel connections are intuitive and easily accessible , and wall-hanging was a breeze . looked at many lcd televisions and there are better choices for sure , but it 's hard to beat the performance of this set at the low price . highly satisfied !
0	wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to be considered normal wear , and mousing surface was dificult to clean it hold onto the dirt with its textured surface . i just couldnt suggest anyone else spent $ 15 on a mousepad that isnt going to last them
0	after less than one week of use , i am forced to return this product due to its inability to maintain a reliable network connection . in 5 days , i have had to cycle power on this unit , on average , more than once per day after it locks up . the web ui fails to respond to connection requests , it loses the ability to communicate with the internet and the only solution is to cycle power . i have tried to work with netgear technical support , but their suggestions ( e.g. , lower mtu ) have been useless and their responses quite tardy . if you are looking for a firewall/vpn unit , i suggest you pass on this particular product
1	i have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months , i have only had 1 burn badly . have n't found a dvd player yet that they wo n't play in
0	the problem is i have more than one guitar this one is my least favorite . p.s . has bad soun
0	i bought a pair in january and loved them . sound is as lovely as everyone describes . however , there are something seriously lacking in the build quality . the soft wires felt flimsy to me when i first opened it , but i thought i 'd just take extra care . at 1 month of careful usage , the plastic-covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened that i could almost use them as chopsticks , and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion . at 2 months of careful usage , the wires had half-ripped from the plug -- which i repaired the best i could with unsightly electrical tape . however , at 3rd month , the left bud fell completely off . i am very disappointed -- it is one of the best-sounding phones i 've ever had ( i 've owned both grado s60 and s90 , and sennheisers ) , but man , they need to do something about making this baby last
0	i paid $ 35 for a barely adequate product case . it does not securely mount or protect the creative zen . it is overpriced and underperforms . as others have mentioned , you must cut it out of the protective covering only to discover that the internal configuration of the case does not protect the screen nor clamp or positively hold the player . the set up feature is a joke -- you have to configure the assembly with an elastic band . taking it out of case voids the ability to return the product . the design engineer should be fired . do not buy -- this is jun
0	i do n't like these radios becase they only go about 1/2 the mile . the battery does n't hold full charge . i would recommend going with motorola model or midland that will give you better range
0	i also was misled into thinking i was getting ten of these tapes , not one . while the tape is ok , it is absolutely not worth the price for a single basic vhs tape . i am usually a big amazon fan , but this advertisement is very poor
1	maybe beginning ones were a bad batch ? had mine months now and it works great . everything it says , it does . no problems keeping it in the system and did not cause any errors .
0	purchased cobra 75 wx st all-in-handset mobile cb about 1 year ago . easy installation , up-front controls , very convenient . six months after installation speaker in mike failed , could only get sound through external speaker , using external jack . repair shop said it would cost almost as much to fix as the unit cost .
0	o.k. , i purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now . these batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives . i do n't know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is , but these did n't last being on the shelf for a little over a year . i will never buy this brand again
0	this unit replaced my old aio 7410 , which i loved . this one just feels cheap . the construction is cheap , parts are loose , and it feels like a child 's toy , not an office tool . given the choice , i would not buy another one
1	what can i say , it 's an ink cartridge . you get a lot of pages out of it , its great quality , and thats about it
1	you can count on every monster cable made . it 's worth the extra money over the cheap ones . the gauge of the wire is thicker and the ends are made of better material
0	the screen is too small . if you want to watch it in your car , you have to cover it because the back light is too week .
0	with no mode settings ( repeat , shuffle , etc ) or shock protection , this cd player is pretty undesirable , but if you 're just looking for something to hold you over then this 'll do . it has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright . it could be with just mine , but every pair of headphones , new and old , that i use with it , the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers , they work fine . like i said , if you just want a temporary thing then i guess this is good for you
1	still embarking on spooling off all the hi-8 tapes i have , but i 've been very satisfied with the plextor unit so far . first thing i did was to spool one hi-8 tape and then make a dvd , using the functionality of the bundled windvd creator software . good news : it worked , and a few hours after i started , i was watching the dvd i created , on my bedroom dvd player . bad news : the software is full of minor and sometimes more than minor annoyances . it may be that i 'm still climbing the learning curve with it , but i think it 's just not very good . i 'm looking into other solutions , such as pinnacle , adobe premiere elements , etc . meanwhile , i keep spooling . i have n't yet tried the tv capture in any depth . it looked like it worked , but again , with some annoyances on the software side . plextor could improve this offering vastly with the addition of some better bundled software
0	the clear plastic windows of the sleeves emit a strong chemical smell . i bought two boxes ; both boxes stank . maybe if you pay a little more you get the non-stinky kind . you get red , orange , yellow , green and blue sleeves , 10 of each
1	this carry case is great . it would be even greater if it had a carry strap
0	we bought this clock radio , got it home , set it up , realized that it did n't have battery back up , called sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks ... .how bizarre ! ! they do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center ! boxed it up and it 's going right back where it came from . if it 's okay not to have battery back up , it might deserve a chance , however , what 's the use in having an alarm clock if you ca n't trust that it will indeed wake you up
1	i needed a way to power my laptop , and my batteries for my camcorder , as well as my digital camera . this was done without a problem when my wife and i visited slovakia .
0	i own a magellan meridian marine unit . just found out that you can only get 1 access code per program . i purchased 2 64 meg cards in hopes of downloading more than 1 map per card . not only can i not down load more than 1 map , i can not get an access code for additional cards . lost money all the way around . magellan offered me the opportunity to buy the blue nav xl charts at $ 179.00 , but low and behold , they come with the same defect of 1 unlock code per program . i was a believer in magellan , but switching to garmin today ! david
0	i thought this item came with or you had a choice of color . it did not . it is silver with black trim . it is also not very portible , you have to play it while its sitting on a flat , level surface .
1	is it expensive ? , yes it is ! ! ! however , i was conecting my ipod mini to my speakers with two cables , mini jack cable and power cable and it was very unconfortable to do every day . the dock is a great solution for this issue . now , i just insert the ipod mini in the dock . easy , fast and confortable . additionaly , i can read easyly the song i am listening to
0	i 'm sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if i had used it ; i have found samsung products to be very good . i did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my xm satellite radio subscription . i already am paying costs for two radios . i purchased this item to have more portable capabilities , but i did not want to incur an additional charge on my xm account . consequently , i returned the product without using it
1	i had owned an lg burner and from the time i got it , it never worked right . i must have made 60 or 70 coasters before i decided that it was'nt the media , it was the crappy lg brand burner . i was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good , but as i found out with my lg experience , that is not always true . my brother has an older model sony burner and although his is slow , it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it , so i took a chance and purchased the sony dru-810a . that was the best decision i could have made . i will never buy another brand burner other that sony brand . i have had this burner about 7 or 8 months . i am a very heavy burner and i have not made one coaster . one thing i loved about my brother 's sony burner is that i could use any brand of media . the same thing is true of the dru-810a . i do n't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is . this burner loves everything . i had looked at the plextor brand , but i did'nt want to pay $ 100.00 and i looked at nec brand , liteon , benq . etc. , but i am so happy that i passed on them all and got the sony . it burns super fast . some people say that it is loud , but it 's not loud to me . i got my burner from tiger direct for $ 50.00 . my sister 's computer came with a crappy lg brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too , so for christmas i am buying her a sony dur-810a so she can finally burn some movies . for my money , this is the best burner bar none .
0	got it at walmart ca n't even remove a scuff . i give it -100 good thing i could return it
0	i live in the wash. dc area and we have pretty bad traffic . i normally take a route that is n't extremely bad but does has congestion . i get no warnings at all . also , recently there was a smaller side road ( non-highway but well used road ) that was closed on both directions but had no information on this road . the antenna works but clear channels traffic information sucks . sucks really bad . when i check the traffic information , the only information i get is the main large interstate highways . do yourself a favor and do n't buy this . who knows , maybe the xm traffic service is better but i can honestly tell you clear channel traffic service sucks ! maybe i 'll get some traffic information traveling on i-95 somewhere ... sorry for the unproffesionalism but its the honest truth
0	the uno 's midi input did not work with my roland a-37 midi controller keyboard , even after downloading the latest drivers . using cakewalk ( home studio 4 running on a compaq v2000 laptop ) to record and view the individual midi events , i could see that some of the note-off messages had been improperly decoded by the uno as note c-zero . this caused those notes to ring indefinitely and caused an ultra-low note to sound ... very unpleasant and obviously unusable . the midi output did work fine driving my roland fantom xr and roland jv-1010 with no problems . after reading another uno a-37 user 's identical problem ( on amazon ) , i returned the uno and purchased an edirol ( roland ) ua-25 audio/midi interface . it works perfectly with all of my equipment including the a-37
0	when i went to use this product i did n't even have it for a day and the antenna broke
1	i just love the color , the stile and the price . it is a perfect player . thank you .
0	i had read several reviews here before purchasing this product , but went ahead and bought it anyway , thinking that logitech might have fixed their quality problems since those reviews were posted . i was wrong . after a few weeks of satisfactory use ( long enough to get past amazon 's reasonable window for returns ) , the space bar started working intermittently . incredibly annoying , and it renders the device unusable for all practical purposes . even before the space bar turned against me i was unimpressed with the feel of the keys ( i use a dell wireless keyboard , an apple wireless keyboard and the keyboard on my ibm x-series laptop ) . bottom line - the thing looks great on a desk , and it is nicely compact , but it probably wo n't do what you need it to . look elsewhere
1	this cd/dvd holder is sturdy and stylish . i needed something to look nice , but hold my stuff , and those wallet-type options were n't really cutting it for me . i had also purchased something similiar ( not case logic ) from another store and was unimpressed by how flimsy it was . i now have 4 or 5 of these and they look great all lined up . i plan on getting more as needed . when they get full , it still stays sturdy and fits in the holder ( the other one i purchased ballooned out and had to be forced to get it in ) . the only con i can think of is the price . for me , it 's worth it , but that may not be the case for you if there are budget constraints
0	and i was right ... .i should have passed on this . it was a pain to configure , and then none of the settings would stick . whenever i changed the default password , it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset . that kind of defeats the point . returning this item so i can get something decent . the money saved is not worth it
1	the nike+ system has really been a good motivator for me . as a new runner , i need all the motivation and positive reinforcement i can get . the challenges and goals are a good way to keep on track as well . i did n't buy the nike+ shoes - i use mine with the marware sportsuit relay set up . it 's a great system and a lot cheaper than spending $ 100 for a pair of running shoes when i already have a couple good pairs in the closet . both products are highly recommended
0	you can get a 4 pack of emerging power 2100 mah batteries for 9.95 on this very site . i did . they work great . why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries . ridiculous
0	this phone has about a 20 foot range before it starts cutting out . it has great features but you ca n't really move all about your home
0	i love the idea of this product , and i loved working with it . i created a great layout that looked fabulous on screen . but unless you have an epson printer , it is very difficult to print out a great copy . my hp deskjet could not handle the supplied photo paper , so a friend printed on his lexmark for me . it worked better , but still had a few problems . more paper should be included in the package in case of printing problems because after several printing problems , we ran out of paper and i could not find the same photo paper in any store ; i ended up buying a second package just to get more of the same paper . next time , i will make a book using the ofoto site -- much more professional looking ( 2-sided ) and just as cheap
1	as your dvd/cd collections grow , these are ideal for protecting and storing your `` treasures '' . easy to open and take up little storage space . the center lock tab is secure but allows you to remove the discs from the case with ease . just a great product
1	i have owned this backpack for almost two years and have put thousands of miles on it in nyc ( my home town ) and traveling on business across the us . a place for everything and everything in its place . first this thing has 3 major compartments and a 4th 'open ' compartment ; a padded laptop compartment large enough for a mac 17 '' with enough room left over of books or magazines . the second compartment has an internal file folder compression panel , that keeps your paperwork flat , orderly and compressed against your body ( if you ever had the paper clip come off of a 40 page document in your backpack you know how great this feature is ) . the final main compartment contains an integrated open-top mesh bag for your power brick and other miscellaneous computer gear . again this has been designed to keep the weight compressed and close to your body . each compartment has plenty of extra room beyond its required purpose . the forth 'open ' compartment is stiff outer panel with a compression draw strings around the sides in which you can stuff : your book , newspaper , umbrella , rain jacket , lunch , magazine , camera , ipod or anything you need to securely stash away and retrieve at a moments notice while on the go . a great feature ! finally this rig is fitted out with no less than 5 additional zippered pockets and 4 pockets-inside-of-pockets and : a separate gear bag , as well as a cd-rom sleeve and a removable cell phone pocket on the shoulder strap . the styling is professional enough of serious meetings . you can also carry the bag to the side with its well padded handle . this is key in elevators and subways . all and all you can load this down for a 3 day road trip and it still feels solid and balanced on your back . final notes : - zippers are high quality with big rubber grips - the black grey color scheme will not show dirt and wear . - fits snug under airline seats - good padding on shoulders and back panel . - did i mention all the pockets ? any down side ? having this bag becomes an exercise in self control for pack-rats . when full this bag is big . but if you do n't mind looking looking geeky and knocking people over when you turn around fill it up and your good to go . other wise just limit your stuff .
0	being a graduate student and living in an apartment , i was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments . it prints off things quite well and it is fast . it does not , however , print 500 pages per month . 50-100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over $ 20 , which is high considering how often you need to buy them . the item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition .
1	you may as well pitch the instructions because they 're worthless ( and the only reason i 'm not giving a 5-star rating for the ads tech video xpress ) . i was about ready to pitch the product as well , after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work . ultimately , i gave up on relying solely on the program it came with , and i instead opted to try it on my windows movie maker . yahoo ! perseverance paid off ! once i switched to movie maker , this tool worked great ! to date , i 've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that i was able to burn to dvds . i just leave my xpress hooked up to the back of my television so i do n't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again . doing that , i can connect my laptop to the xpress and start the video converting process within 3-4 minutes . my movie maker program takes over the entire process . the ads tech video xpress has been especially useful for me because i teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students . before purchasing xpress , i had crudely edited videos that i was reluctant to use ; my videos had lots of amateur stop/start points . using movie maker with xpress , i was able to download these videos to my laptop , then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless . pretty cool . i 'm glad i took a chance on this product ! below are hook-up and program instructions i 've written to myself for easy reference later . hopefully they 'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product : first , hook up the video xpress equipment as follows : 1 . s-cable ( buy one , since it does n't come with the videoxpress ) goes from the back of your television to the videoxpress . 2 . use red/white/yellow cords running into the back of the vcr/dvd that is hooked up to your televion as follows : - all three plug into the `` video out '' column - all three plug into the videoxpress tool at the other end . 3 . the usb plug for the videoxpress tool plugs into the back of the computer . next , open the instant video xpress program and verify the settings are as follows : - `` ntsc m '' for the video standard setting - `` 640 x 480 '' and `` 60 fps ( vga ) '' for video format - `` dvd , vcr , tv '' for video source - `` video composite '' for video input under the program advanced settings : - low motion ( tv , vcd , dvd ) - cpu support : `` sse3 '' - stereo system : `` mts '' - video decoder : `` video standard : ntsc_m '' under properties within the program advanced settings : - stream format : video format : `` ntsc_m '' - frame rate : `` 59.940 '' - color space/compression : `` yuy2 '' - outputs size : `` 640x480 '' finally , close the instant video xpress program . ( windows movie maker ca n't access the video until this program is closed . and yes , it 's silly to have to open it , make those setting changes , then close it , but video xpress wo n't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps . ) in case you need this information for windows movie maker , the steps ( in order ) are as follows : under `` file , '' click on `` capture video . '' use the following settings : - audio device set at : `` usb2.0 analog audio device '' - video input source set at : `` composite '' under configure video capture device : - video format : video standard : `` ntsc_m '' frame rate : `` 29.970 '' color space/compression : `` yuy2 '' output size : `` 640x480 '' under camera settings : - deinterlace method : `` low motion ( tv , vcd , dvd ) '' - cpu support : `` sse3 '' - stereosystem : `` mts '' under video decoder : video standard : `` mtsc_m '' signal detected : `` 1 '' lines detected : `` 525 '' then ... give the file a name and indicate where to save it set it for `` best quality '' for playback . then `` start capture . '' if the video xpress is hooked up and running correctly , you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television , but you will not hear the sound . when you finish capturing and play it back , then you 'll hear the sound . i know , i know -- clear as mud . but hey , it 's better than the xpress instructions ! : -
0	specs look good . hdmi 1.3a , 1080p , firmware upgrade over ethernet , etc . the unit seems to be solid ( heavy ) and well built . however , toshiba chose to ship this hd-dvd player with only a composite a/v cable ( yellow , red , white rca jacks ) in the box . the best resolution you can get with this cable is 480i , and not even as good as an s-video connection for that ! it is pretty amazing that a high-end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high-definition capabilities and hdmi 1.3a interface is being shipped without a cable set ( component video or hdmi ) that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an hdtv . i do n't know how much cost savings toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than $ 5 . now let 's get to the real review : pros : - one of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular dvds to 1080p . the upscaling is very high quality . the unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered dvds . - if the weight of the unit is any indication , build quality is high . - it has an ethernet port for firmware updates ( and possible future functionality ) cons : - very slow boot time . takes longer to boot than my windows xp pc . - especially durimg 1080p hd-dvd playback , the unit gets very hot . make sure your enclosure/rack is open in the back . there is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player . - this player has no zoom/scaling functions for dealing with non-anomorphic dvds , so you have to use your tvs scaling function . kind of a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers
1	i love my tooldial and its ' software . my only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively . i frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in-design a little . overall great product and i expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs . works very well in tandem with a wacom tablet
0	do not order this item , if you want a dvd player with a 5 inch screen . this item is not as pictured . you will receive a small orange colored player with a 3.5 inch screen
0	the cables to go 4 port usb ps @ unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on . but i have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the kvm is not switched to that device . the video card goes into some blacked out video mode . the pc has to be shutdown . the box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error . the box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc . you must bo the port and watch the reboot . then card is ok until next reboot unattended . frustrating . the keyboard and mouse are ok . but with wireless keyboard/mouse combo , the box can not be on auto scan mode . too many drawbacks
1	if you 're considering the viamichelin ( under $ 200 gps ) , you 're probably trying to decide if a gps that is more than $ 100 cheaper ( much more than $ 100 in some cases ) than its competitors is really any good . honestly , i would have been skeptical too , however , a relative bought one of these units , and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before i decided to purchase one myself . my brief summary is that yes , this unit is a good gps and a great value . after using mine on a trip , i 'd have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine . background : my gps experience is limited to a 7-year old garmin iii plus . i had to plan detailed trips on my pc using mapsource , then upload the waypoints and routes to the gps . it could be a time consuming process , and because the unit was n't necessarily user friendly , my wife never learned how to use it . enter the viamichelin . we just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit . set-up time for the trip was about a minute - all i had to do was program in the street address of our destination . now for the rundown . first - what it does n't do well . a ) using it for the past two weeks ( as a test only ) around my home town , i was a little disappointed . it never sent me the wrong way , but it did n't always take the best route . some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area ; and in some cases old `` logging '' roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built ; and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route . although this was disconcerting at first , i do n't think it is a big deal as you 'll see later . b ) macro-directions - i.e . for a several hundred mile trip . it will get you there , and if you 're taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns , this would be a good device if you are n't familiar with the route . but my route this weekend was very simple . get to the interstate and drive . it did n't pick my preferred route to the interstate , and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four-lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate . ( although it did recover and finally suggest my route as i stubbornly drove `` my way . '' ) so , for a major trip , i 'd recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route . use this device if you have a lot of mind-numbing turn-by-turn . now , what it does well : a ) voice prompts are great . it does n't matter that it does n't say the street names . turn right in 300 feet is good enough - especially with the map that you can glance at . b ) it did great around my destination towns of charlotte , nc ; gastonia , nc , and rock hill , sc . did it take the best route as i drove from soccer fields , to hotels , to restaurants ? i do n't know since i was n't familiar with the areas , but the routes seems to be just fine , they got me exactly where i needed to go , and i never had to look at a road map . and after all , this was the main reason i needed a newer gps . it passed this with flying colors . c ) my wife did some of the set-up while in the car . she 'll be using this one on her on very soon . d ) we wanted to find a particular restaurant , but did n't have the street address . the restaurant was in the points of interest database , and it took us right to it . also , finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great . i also found a feature that was not listed in the 89-page manual . from the navigation map , if you touch the screen , it has a `` bypass route '' option . it will give you some distant options ( 1 mi , 5 mi , etc . ) then it will find a bypass route for you . so , if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam , this will route you off the interstate , take you up the road and bring you back on . obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving , but then it 's going to try to turn you around and/or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer . the bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out . in the future , i would like to do a side-by-side comparison w/ a more expensive ( borrowed ) gps . also , after more experience , i 'd like to update this review . bottom line : i am glad i bought this unit . i can not imagine spending $ 100- $ 500 more on a more expensive model . though the higher priced models may have better features , the value for the extra money just is n't there for me
0	why not sell the thing with a battery , it 's a special battery , not available in the boonies , so i have a choice ... .drive 30 miles or wait another week for a battery to come in the mail . iknow , iknow in the text it does say battery not included but who reads that ? so for the folks who read this ... buy a battery too ! ! !
1	i 've never had any problems with memorex dvd 's or cd 's . when i was ordering and read some of the reviews here , i had to go back and look at what i was using to make sure . i 've always taken it for granted and only posted this review to counteract some of the negative ones . i do n't know why some users are having problems , but these dvd 's always worked great for me , and i record on average over one a day
0	awesome concept , however i live in an apartment that does n't have any south facing windows , so i was unable to get a signal . i strongly advise against calling the xm radio help # from a phone that wo n't use up your cell phone minutes . had to call them four different times , and all they did was read me the instruction manual , and tell me that if i do n't have signal my radio wo n't work ( i had clearly established that fact already ) . i recieved the radio for free because of a rebate , and did n't even intend on getting xm radio , but figured since the unit was free , and an mp3 player , to give it a try . i was going to break down and buy the $ 70 car kit but then i ran across the agt sportscaster for $ 20 , which came with a car kit . since i ca n't use it in my house , i hook up the home base to the car kit , and at least i can use it that way . this ended up being a lot of work for something i was n't sure i wanted in the first place . have n't used the mp3 player yet , but napster does not seem the most user friendly . ( i have the majority of my songs on itunes
1	i have used this machine for a few months now , but have not made use of all possible features . however , this is what i can say : * basic copying , fax , scanning -- excellent * scanning with character recognition -- excellent but would prefer to have options ala omnipage * duplex printing ( printing on both sides ) -- very good , except the menu digging is ackward * build quality and overall performace -- excellent , prints fast , few jams , feels very sturdy * ease of use -- very good and straight forward * features -- excellent , loaded with capabilities this machine is beautiful and no other machine i have used comes close , save for high end office machines costing $ thousands . i ca n't get over how happy i am with this one , i 've been waiting for a quality mfc since before they came out , and finally i am satisfied . highly recommended
0	i ordered this television with high hopes , knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that i would luck out and save a bundle . but you get what you pay for . every sharp aquos lcd tv manufactured before april 1 , 2006 shipped with bad firmware . what does this mean to you ? for me , it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the tv and turning it on , it turned itself off and never turned back on again . resets , system resets , power cycling , unplugging components did n't help . my tv was completely bricked . a search turned up threads on websites like avs forum with other owners of sharp tvs in the d4u and d6u series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase . for them , the fix was a visit to a sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the tv . i say a `` visit '' because sharp does not cover in-house technician visits for tvs under 32 '' , a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled . so here i am , 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no tv to show for it . instead , it sits at the authorized service center ( because sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either ) . i 'm willing to bet all of the inventory of d6us that tigerdirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 4/1/2006 . check the serial number on your tv if you do order one . if it begins with a 501-512 , 601 , 602 or 603 , immediately demand a firmware upgrade from sharp ( 1-800-be-sharp ) , regardless of whether or not you 're experiencing these issues ; you will eventually , and hopefully while sharp 's warranty is still in effect for you .

1	i have two ipods that do n't work . i bought a shuffle first and that has an error that i ca n't fix and apple ca n't fix . so , i thought i 'd buy 1gb ipod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer . so , this time i made the right decision and bought the 30 gb zune . wow ! the zune is so much better ! it has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely , instead of making you frustrated like the ipod . the screen is perfect . sound quality is excellent . 5 stars for the zune .
0	there is a reason that the value pack is so much cheaper . the cartridges are not full ! i just got off the phone with hp tech support and they confirmed this . the cartridges sold with the value pack are labeled as *custom* cartridges that have enough ink to print 150 4x6 photos . in fact , the tech support rep discribed the *custom* cartridges as having `` way less '' than standard cartridges , `` less than 50 % full '' . on a related note , i asked him if the initial cartridges that came with my new printer were full , and he said they should have been full standard cartridges . so this value pack is n't such a great value now , is it ?
0	i tested this along with the neuros mpeg4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the neuros . the picture with the sandisk is very pixelated , especially with fast action sports like football and basketball . the sandisk does have a better interface , and is easier to understand and set up quickly , but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor . fyi - i 'm using a psp as my viewer
1	the creative zen is outstanding . took a little while to get use to the controls but the sound is incredible . i bought one for my wife as well and see loves it . i did spend a little extra money for better earbuds . for the price that i paid - [ ... ] for 8gb you ca n't go wrong
0	i purchased one of these radios before christmas and it works great . i decided i wanted another for work , so i ordered another one . i recived my radio a couple of days ago and had to send it back because the `` preset '' weather stations are off the mark and the only thing i can pick up is distorted and garbled . they sent me a replacement and it too is off station . at this point , i 'm wondering if the first one i got was the exception . i do not reccomend this product unless you just want an am/fm radio , that part works great . this will be my last first alert purchase unless i can try it out first !
1	i have had other apc battery backup 's in the past , and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit . given our power failures , brown out , and the high wind and storms in our area the apc does an excellent job . i have not only my desktop pc , but my scanner , printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures

0	malfunctions : 1 . the port for connecting to a pc became loose and unreliable , frequently disconnecting while i was trying to transfer music . 2 . the little knob stopped working properly : it was no longer possible to fast-forward . 3 . finally , the screen cracked for me and no longer displayed anything . design issues : it would be nice to be able to access music by id3 tag ( i.e . artist , genre , song title ) . it takes a long time to start up , generally ~20 seconds but up to ~2 minutes if you just changed the music on it . it 's nice that you can delete music on the player without having to connect it to a computer , for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again . however , the interface to do this was so inconvenient ( including audio playback stopping and long lag times ) that i rarely used this feature in practice . the earbuds that come with it did n't stay in my ears well ; i bought new ones . good things : i loved the fact that it had an fm radio and a voice recorder ( the reasons that i bought it ) . it 's easy to access the hard drive from any computer , without any software needed . the large storage capacity proved fully necessary . you can change playback modes with a single button press ( shuffle versus ordered , all songs versus current folder only ) . my basis for comparison : i 've also owned a creative zen jukebox ( which i liked a lot but which i sold because i wanted the fm radio and voice recorder on the iaudio ) and , currently , a used fourth generation ipod , which has been working well so far except for some occasional quirks

1	i bought these after buying tdk for the past 5 years and now only being able to get memorex at a low price ( i 've had very bad experiences with memorex cdrs in the past ) . these were surprisingly cheap as verbatim is one of the highest quality blank media brands . not surprisingly , the discs lived up to expectations on my plextor-716a drive . i have n't tested a whole lot yet , but the ones i did test , burn flawlessly and when disc scans were run , there were no errors . you really ca n't go wrong with verbatim . just buy them

0	this is my fourth epson printer and probably my last . the epson rx580 needs several ink cartridges . if any of them is out of ink , you ca n't print at all . if you 're out of yellow ink , you still can not print a purely black/white document ! ! the system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out . i really resent that epson is taking advantage of customers like that

( one recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat . ) this is surprising , considering that the dt880 is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid-priced headphones . the bass is full but nicely textured - not a touch of bass bloat to be found here . the highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me , and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage . instead of the music being on top of your , these beyers lend a perceived distance of a few feet ; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant , and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way . these headphones do n't require a headphone amp , but certainly profit from one . the 30 ohm version makes for more volume , though the 250 ohm version is standard , and best for most daily listening . the dt880 sounds great , but lacks a tad of the k701 's high-end sparkle . conversely , beyer 's value , comfort , and workmanship ca n't help but impress . this is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the akgs and the senn 650s , but listeners are always impressed by the dt880s sound . it may be your best value in a mid-priced , all-purpose headphone
0	after 3 days of having this controller , it already started to have problems . the docking station would not pick up charges from the battery anymore making my controller useless . for the amount of money i spent , i am very disappointed
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports . in my case , i had plenty of ports , but needed an extension cable , which would help me in plugging the flash drives , whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires ( i keep my cpu , under the table ) .the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough . overall good value for price
0	i burn about 50 cds a week in live music trades . i can tell you from experience that these discs do not last . after a year or so , they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems . any scratches that they have only make it worse . i recommend using sony , fuji , or tdk . all the others are cheaply made in comparison and just do n't stand the test of time . so if you care about preserving your cds , do n't use these ones
1	this monitor is an awesome buy . i had no problems with my monitor , dead pixel-wise . the only complaints i have to add are those that others have already voiced . the stand does not securely fasten to the monitor , it just sort of sits there ... a good push and down she may go . the menu buttons on the right side are n't confusing to use , my other monitors have used a similar setup : menu activates menu and also activates a menu item , up/down change values , menu backs out and there is a menu item to exit . if i had put two of these monitors side by side , i can see how accessing the power button of the monitor on the left would be an issue , minor but perhaps irksome . i have not tested the speakers , but seriously a good set of speakers wo n't set you back much , that 's not what this monitor is for . i would definitely buy another one in a heartbeat , if i did n't already have three monitors to begin with
0	i purchased 16 of the allsop 26625 dvd/vhs organizers . after i had 4 or 5 of them on the floor , loaded with dvds , i was going to move them to load the next batch . but , when i picked them up off the floor , two of them came apart , dropping the dvds on the floor . knowing they were weak , i tried to hold the next one together , but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners ; the other two corners gave way , and my hands came together , scattering dvds all over the floor . looking at the pieces that came apart , i saw that hooks were molded into the plastic and were supposed to snap over ridges on the next piece . but the hooks were too shallow to hold against the strain of holding them with the dvds facing upward , and they were the same on all 16 boxes . i emailed the manufacturer ( from whom i had bought 12 of the boxes ) and asked , since it would be time-consuming for me to send them back , and costly for them , what would they offer me if i just kept them and glued the corners together . i had absolutely no response . i ended up spending two evenings snapping the boxes apart , glueing the 112 attachment points and reassembling them . i think they will be ok , now , but i would not have purchased them if i knew they were so poorly manufactured . and , i do not have any good thoughts about allsop 's customer service
0	it was n't clear from the packaging that this does n't work with the newer ipods with video . i had to search the internet ( after i already purchased and could see that it clearly did n't fit ) to find this information
1	i recently ordered this for a week long trip i was planning to olympic national park . wow what a great find . i did n't have to worry about how many pictures my memory card would hold and could just snap away . i think it also increased my shutter speed too . i would definitely recommend this to anyone and have actually
0	i ordered this item thinking that it would be useful when on the road in hotel rooms to light up my work area . wrong ! ! the light is so dim , the only thing it might be good for is a night light ! this lamp is a good idea , but much too weak to be of any help
1	i mean seriously , i 'm running a ubuntu box here . with other card-type things , sometimes i 'd have to modify or find drivers and wrappers for some stuff to work - not with this . i just slid it into the computer and wa-bam - makes my dvd player a bajillion times faster than it was before and just worked out of the box
0	i tried 3 of these dvd+rs , none of them worked , errors in every burn . i used another brand to burn the session and it worked perfectly , so it is definately a problem with these dvd+rs and not with my burner
1	it is a good universal remote control , i had several but this is the only one that could realy controles my tv wel
1	i had been using my air conditioning vents to hold my xm radio and this was recommended to me through a friend . it 's super easy to install and works great . it does n't move or shake while driving and is adjustable height wise to fit most car setups . it was well worth the money and in the summer heat , i am glad i bought it and got my extra air conditioning vent back
0	i bought a 700 series iriver to use at the gym , which came with this armband , at first it was great , but it did n't last , there are two clasps which do n't sta attcked well , and the pocket that holds the mp3 player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use
1	i purchased this usb light/fan combo mainly for the fan . i 'm one of those guys who is a human heater -- always a little warmer than everyone else . i use this fan when i 'm studying in the library , on the computer at a coffee shop or even at home using my laptop at the desk . it provides a nice little jet of air right at my face which makes me feel cooler all over . i can even direct it right in front of me and only the nose of the rotor head is visible because when the fan is running , of course , you can see right through the blades . the fan runs quietly too . i 've had a couple of times when the fan is making a bit of a noise or is n't running a quickly as normal . i just pop off the rotor head , adjust the blades a bit ( they are flexible vinyl and i give them a little twist and a crease to make them more rigid as they sometimes get bent in my carrying case ) , pop the rotor head back on and it 's good as new again . while i like this product a lot , i doubt with frequent use that it will last much more than a year but i still think it 's well worth it . my only regret is that i did n't order two or three of these for future back-ups if needed . the light works well too . it does not illuminate the entire keyboard but in a dark setting it does provide enough illumination for the typical user ( a hunt and peck typist may be frustrated but i think it may be enough light for that kind of visibility as well ) and definitely enough light to read from a book or hard copy document .
0	pro -- - * compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket , yet opens to a comfortable working size with full-sized keys , including a number row . for those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets , this is decidedly a deal-maker over the stowaway keyboard which requires alt-key combinations to access numbers and symbols . the full-size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the freedom keyboard . to my knowledge , there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has *both* full-size keys *and* a number/symbol row . * the bluetooth connection is clean , lag free , and accurate . con -- - * the software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome , requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use , and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement ( see below ) . * flimsy locking mechanism / not usable on a lap . the manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat `` while on your lap or on a non-flat surface '' . this `` lock '' is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip , which travels 7/8 '' along the top of the board from the left half into the right . even when locked , the keyboard does n't lay flat , and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user 's legs , held in place only by one thin piece of wire , the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated `` v '' shape after any amount of light-handed typing . hp could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics . a user must find a solid flat surface to type on , such as a book . and of course , when sitting on a flat surface , the lock is n't needed . * the manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to `` enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your ... pocketpc '' . unfortunately , the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non-removable cradle . a quick look at the freedom keyboard 's pull-out cradle offers hp a lesson in how to do it right . * the keyboard ships with no case , as do most other portable keyboards with non-rugged exteriors . the attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys . * it does n't turn off . yes , you read that last bullet correctly : you ca n't turn this thing off . there 's no power switch . the button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld ; it 's not a power switch . what this means is , even when folded and not in use , even when appearing to be dormant , and even when the software shows that there 's no bluetooth connection , the keyboard is still eating your batteries . the automatic `` sleep mode '' simply disables the wireless connection ; it does not power down the keyboard . two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard , you 'll return to find them dead . not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes . the only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries . the battery cover , need i add , breaks easilly . sound unbelievable ? go to the major websites dedicated to pocketpcs , and do a search of their forums using the keywords `` bluetooth keyboard '' . this is not a case of a know-nothing customer who needs to read the manual . the manual , such as it is , makes no mention of an absent power switch . for the mobile user then , in addition to the keyboard itself , one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on , to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired , to carry the batteries separately , and to re-enter the access key into the software after reinserting those batteries . although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket , the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user . add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use , the hp ipaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1/3 it 's $ 100 retail price , and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full-size keys and number row . how hp ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me . all potential buyers of ipaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what , if any , emphasis hp places on quality of design and the integrity of ipaq name . it reflects also the degree of respect hp has for the intelligence of their customers . one might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non-removable cradle , or the parsimony of not including a case . one might even forgive the useless locking mechanism . but when hp is either too dumb to include an on/off switch , or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care , then i must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the ipaq name . if hp is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for $ 100 , then i can not believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a pocketpc for $ 300-400 . my next handheld upgrade , i 'll probably stay with fujitsu-siemens loox ( i currently use a loox720 , a truly excellent ppc ) , or maybe go with a dell axim . i wo n't even consider an ipaq . the hp bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality . those at hp responsible for protecting public perception of the ipaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves .
1	these ear buds provide a very good fit . they block out a lot of external noise . much better than my previous ear buds . the sound is clear with good bass . definitely worth the price
1	this has a nice size screen . it only has 3 buttons.play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it . i was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button . i just found this out by trial . there was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital . this would only last a second or two . at first i thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them . the volume control is on the side , as well as the power button . it could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me
1	i use this 1gb card in my sony playstation portable , and it is awesome ! the tranfer rate using the usb 2.0 cable to the psp is very good , and i love having all that storage space for movies , music , and images . i got the ultra ii because i had read that sandisk outperformed sony in speed tests , and i have to agree . the tranfer rate seems much faster than with the 32mb sony card that came with the psp . for an extra $ 5- $ 10 i got the ultra ii that has a warranty and better performance . i think it is well worth it
0	the good : when i first heard about this board i was incredibly excited . i have been playing bf2 ( battlefield 2 ) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys . so it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game . the interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that i have seen . but the price for each is kind of high but well worth it . the bad : the board is constructed well but do n't expect this to replace your home keyboard . the `` windows keyset '' that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with ( i might be biased since i have a msoft ergonomic split keyboard ) . in-game typing is difficult at best ( with the gaming keysets ) . with most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical ( not staggered.. like u , j and m keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other ) . the keys feel a little `` cheap '' .. when you push them down they do n't bounce back as much . the ugly : about 2 weeks after i purchases this board ( and the bf2 keyset ) 9 keys went completely dead . i tried to reinstall the software , reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of windows xp to no avail . i contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that i have a faulty base unit . duh ! they are `` reviewing my warranty '' but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day . maybe this post is premature but i do n't think i am getting a new base unit . conclusion : the expression `` great idea , bad execution '' holds true here . my opinion : do n't buy this board . ideazon has too many issues , not enough support staff and a website that does n't do anything but look good
1	when the room temperature hot and no one else wants the air conditioner turned on , this desktop air conditioner cools just my 7 feet by 7 feet personal space . it 's heaven . i would n't be without . this is my second order
0	it may work fine for those who use ps2 , but using usb it frequently locks up . i have my laptop and desktop plugged in , but if i unplug the laptop . i have to shut everything down , unplugg the kvm and start over . what a total pai
0	i ordered this cable and ended up sending it back to amazon . and i advised them why . the thx 800 cable is not blue . the thx 600 cable is blue . i called monster cable and got hold of their technical support . they said they have never made a thx 800 cable in blue . amazon obviously has not followed up on this issue
1	i 've been in the newspaper business for many years , and i 've always used recorders at governmental meetings , interviews , etc . -- much easier and faster than taking notes , and it allows me to focus more on my subject . until now , i 've never had a recorder that could pick up everything without a lot of background noise or without having to turn the tape over or replace it in the midst of the event . this little sony is the perfect size , picks up everything without all that background noise and plays it back crystal clear . additionally , it has a long battery life , and i never run out of room while i 'm taping . i could n't ask for more
0	june 04,2006 i purchased this radio for emergency purposes , however it seems to be very week . i am a double amputee and am confined to a wheel chair . i depend on my radio to raise help . but , i am afraid this one will not be dependable . i am not asking for them to be returned or for a refund just letting you and your customers know of a very weak product and i could not reccomend this product to anyone . cobra was the tops in radios but something has happened to the quality . thank you for listening ; william hembree wmhembree @ aol.com
1	i bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me ! so far it does what it 's suppose to do . i am pleased . it 's a little clunky , and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended . we 'll see how it works in 6 months
1	i bought this product mainly for my girlfriend to use on my computer . i find myself using it most of the time , now ! the mouse is great , lost of extra buttons on it ( not that i need them , but it makes it a little more convenient in case i do . ) the keyboard is great ... lots of shortcut buttons right on the keyboard , making navigation very easy . a couple of features on the keyboard i really like are the scroll whell on the left , the favorites buttons ( all customizable , as are all the shortcut buttons on this keyboard ) and the very comfortable hand rest . i got this refurbished and it works like new ! i highly suggest this . the only drawback is that it is a little bigger than i would have liked , but i do n't mind it nearly as much as my girlfriend . if that 's not a problem , i highly suggest this product ! !
0	the printer works great as a usb printer , a fax machine , and copier . it may as well not even have a network port on it . the networking driver will find the printer , but then it goes back to searching for a printer , and this loop continues till you give up . i ca n't tell if thr network scanning works because of the above driver problem . i can tell you that a dell 1600 works great as a network printer , network scanner , fax copier . we have 3 of these and we tried this hp 3055 and i would not reccommend it to anyon
1	sandisk , leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one . it works excellent on my phone samsung t609.i would have bought a 1gb but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it , so bear that in mind . for pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent . for music as an mp3 , lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video . data and in general is terrific ... just like i said sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card . i will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions . only sandisk is extremely reliable . personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly .
1	i wish targus made the same bag just a few inches wider . my toshiba 2600 barely squeezes in the bag . however , it does fit and i was able to mount it between the two seats of our 2004 toyota sienna with no problems . there 's also ample room for cords and dvds . i like how this bag doubles as a storage case and a way to mount it in the car for viewing . all in all , a very nice product .
1	my mom bought me the candlestick phone and it is great . my friends love it , too . it looks really cool and the ringtone it just like my grandmas old phone . i can hear everybody really clear and they have no problem hearing me . i am very happy with this phone
0	pros : uses less batteries than the space shuttle ... ( 6 aas ) great idea gone to h*** quickly due to lack of product support ! apparently the person in charge of designing and marketing tapes for these units suffers from attention deficit disorder and is totally unable to remotely consider any meaningful complete line of tapes . red , blue , white pearl ( paper ? ) - yellow smiley faces . green metalic . black on clear - but no white on clear ... there appears to be little , if any , hope for those who might actually like to color code products in any single medium - plastic , paper , polyester , metallic , etc . just whatever come to the designer 's head is what 's released . five types here . two there . one over here ... no rhyme nor reason . dymo has done themselves no favors here
0	i bought the zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white palm that i had no problems with . it has been nothing but a lemon since i got it . often when i turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them . the graffiti is terrible and rarely works . i have to reset it all the time . customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems . i even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition i sent it to them . i do n't think they even looked at it . after my experience with this palm , i will never buy palm again
1	i needed a replacement receiver for a fairly modest home theater system . i wanted a bare bones 5.1 system ( no 6.1 , 7.1 , 1kw audio power , satellite radio capable , etc . ) i only use the receiver as an audio switch and let the tv handle video source selection . reviewers of the sherwood rd-6500 liked the audio but thought the set-up a little confusing . being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me . the price was certainly right , about the cheapest thing around ( at [ ... ] ) . i bought the unit and have been completely satisfied . i would have given it five stars but heck , nobody 's perfect . i had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality ( full disclosure : my ears are 79 years old ) . the unit has one optical digital , one coax digital and several a/v inputs . the remote lets you pick video 1-3 , cd , tuner and aux inputs . you tell the system which audio source to use for each of these , one time and it remembers . i liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present . i was surprised to find how many premium hd movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in hd either . i also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them . on the negative side i , like other reviewers , bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub-woofer is required
0	i agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download . in this day and age , there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers . a voice recorder is tool for on the go . so we should have to carry a cd with us as well in case we want to plug the recorder into a different machine ? this is just a case of wanton disrespect of the customer by a big company
0	these discs do not work with my canon camcorder . i think the label should inform people they may not be compatible with certain devices
1	i originally bought my daughter an ilive ibcd3816dt boombox for her birthday . the hiss was unbearable , so i took it back and purchased this product . much better quality control and it docks perfectly with her 2gb ipod nano using the supplied insert . very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone . it sounds great , looks good , and the controls are very intuitive .
1	fantastic sound for the money ! ( seems to work well with asus p5w dh , anyway ) nice crisp highs , decent mid-range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick , imo . the only down-side i could find is some of the nonsense-software included is , well , nonsense . creative scores , again
0	although the rs receiver does n't have tv reception ( who cares ) , it is 1/2 the price , pll digital , 3 '' speaker , dx/loc switch , and probably much better quality..
1	i ca n't describe this mp3 with words `` great '' it 's more than great . it fits my pocket , and it 's music quality is great . my sister and i bought this incredible mp3 with doubts but , it is more than great . if somebody is considering buying an mp3 , i strongly recommend to buy this iriver . thank you , thank you , thank you
1	this card worked out of the box on my linux , ubuntu 6.10 based system . this belkin card -- at least the version i have -- is based on the atheros chip set
0	it is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor . buying this handheld was a big mistake
0	this card is such a disappointment . it is soooo sloooooow . i use it for my digital camera , mp3 player , and ipaq . it takes forever to copy anything to and from it
1	the first one i ordered worked for about four days and then stopped recognizing the usb devices i was plugging into it . although i had considered just getting a refund , amazon was quick to replace the card with no hassles . the replacement card has been working fine for a couple of months now . the usb 2 is much faster than the original usb ports that were a part of my original computer and this particular card was a reasonable price
0	the product shipped is not the same as the picture . apparently this is a common thing for this item .
0	i 'm not sure what i expected after i purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $ 40 rebate . but i wish that someone had informed me before i lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic , your voice does n't come through the speaker . i 'm cool with the machine 's sound quality when it comes to playing a cd-g . if i tap the mic , i can hear an extremely faint thud , so i know it 's on , but the volume 's too low -- and , yes , i adjusted the mic controls -- if you want to sing along . which makes this a dinosaur : a boom box in the age of the ipod . really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that had n't been opened . so , when was my first clue ? doh
0	the principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews . i was never able to get the card to do anything . i tried removing and reinstalling the drivers . i tried getting assistance through the web site . i tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call . i 've decided to cut my losses and buy a different card
0	beware of this product . it always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer . i have another usb 1.0 card reader that works perfectly . i upgrade to get the speed boost with usb 2.0 , but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy
1	when i opened my package i was a little disappoined with this product but after using it for a while i learned to like it . it is easy to use the front controls with the inno but akward to turn on and off . overall a nice case . shoped around and found amazon had best price with free shipping . received in about one week
1	bought 2 of these to watch over my house while i am at work . setup is pretty easy , but be prepared to wait a minute after changed settings , many changes when you initial setup the camera require it to restart . camera 's work great together and the free use of [ ... ] to access the cameras is nice . setting up timers and sensor emails/ftp is pretty straight forward but will require a user to test and retest to get the settings just right . pros : price is good for a ip camera with tilt/pan . viewnetcam.com feature is a great addition to the camera package . works great with similar model panasonic cameras . cons : multiple restarts while setting up or making changes ( minor issue ) , limited online support/how-to 's
1	same hp burner/player that is $ 30 or more in the local stores . installation was fast and easy . nero software installed fast , very little info on the nero products , to play dvd you need to install the cyber dvd player on the nero disk .
0	i am a person who actually uses these items , alot . after 2 weeks of using these headphones , the right earpiece quit playing . and i hear ms is not suppporting anything that stops operating . also , it is too expensive . i am enjoying the zune , but all the accessories should be a little more accessible

0	what a lousy battery.used it on my clock and it leaked.i would never use it again . ..
1	the reviewer below identifying himself as `` an electronics fan '' obviously has a deep bias against bose . his multiple reviews about bose products -- here and elsewhere -- are transparently motivated by some animus against bose . was he fired by bose ? did a member of the bose family reject his romantic advances ? did a bose executive accidentally run over his cat ? did he drop a bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe ? the true motivation for this guy 's negative reviews would be fun to know . in the meantime , what we do know is that he has no credibility , and his reviews ( two here , others elsewhere for other bose products ; he 's made maligning bose his life 's work , apparently ) ) should disregarded . i bought a set of black 301 's several years ago to go with my onkyo receiver . we have it hooked up to a television and dvd player for movies . these speakers are in constant use both for the dvd and for music of all types . the room in which they are placed is huge , with an 18 foot-high flat ceiling . the speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day . the speakers work fine for spoken audio for dvd 's ; we can hear dialogue perfectly ; i feel no particular need for a surround-sound system . several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto . i feared a ruptured speaker cone , but the 301 's are very forgiving , no damage has been done . the cats sleep on the speakers ; they clean right up and still look new after five years . these speakers keep on giving total satisfaction , and i quite simply love them . about three years ago i decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market , or at least what i determined to be best after a lot of research . this included a set of the gold-series tower speakers from monitor audio . ( the speaker cones are metallic , with some amount of gold , and gold connections , etc. , etc . ) these monitor audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made ( real wood veneer cabinetry , with the gold cones and the black covers , etc. ) . these speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each . well , i must confess , as awesome as the monitor audios sound , i ca n't really say they sound any better than the bose 301 's ! ! ! they can maybe handle more power , but i assure you the bose 301 's will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less . so , when i recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom , i looked forward to buying a third type of speakers . i ran around and listened to what i could find on display . well , after much contemplation , i went for a second set of the bose 301 's ! ! ! they just could n't be beat , and i would have gladly spent more if i had found something i liked better . but i 'm not going to spend more just so i can say i spent a lot ... there has to be increased performance . and , in my opinion , the 301 's could n't be out-performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range . my first set of 301 's were black . this time i went for the cherry . folks , these are absolutely beautiful speakers : almost as cool looking as my monitor audios . the black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood . no , it is not real wood , but it looks very nice . these things are simply gorgeous . the kind of `` mod '' or futuristic shape which bose has designed really stands out in this lighter-colored version . and , yes , they sound just as good as my original pair . i listen to soft music ( jazz , typically , or ambient ) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume ; i listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions , and the 301 's do n't scare away or distort at all : these things would tear the house apart before they 'd lose sound quality . so , yes , i recommend these highly . they 'd still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price
1	the cam is good ... it has a special feature to show the person/object by automatic adjustment ... and a very good part abt it is , it has a built in mike and helps a lot..
1	they are good for the price . they have a very good sound quality , or at least better than the ones that came with my sony walkman dej001 . the only problem i had is when i connected them to my older philips player , it had a low volume output . and then again , even on the sony player , i had to have the volume at 7 , and it only goes to 9 . if you have a high output player or a computer , these will be great , but if your using them for a low output or old device , these probably wo n't cut the cheese
0	this cartrige never printed any color than red . even after cleaning many , many times ! will never buy another cartrige from them . paying twice the price for one that works is a better investment
1	i gave a detailed review of the base system , but the handset merits comments separately . i have purchased handsets for every room in the house , and because i do n't like using the clip to carry it with me everywhere , i use them . they 're easily customizable through the pc interface , although they can be customized without it as well . each handset gets its out name , so transferring calls or paging a handset is simple . ( no more trying to remember which room has the `` fifth '' handset . ) i 've been impressed with both the battery life and the range of each handset ; i 've read reviews that criticized the range or sound quality , but i 've had no trouble with either despite a few different usage scenarios . if you 're shopping for one of these , then you 've already got the base unit or are considering purchasing it , so you know the quality to expect . i think the uniden clx485 is the best residential phone system i 've ever experienced ; the handset lives up to that standard , too
0	this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made . it felt very light and flimsy , the definition of cheap plastic . not just the construction but the performance was terrible . it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about 10 minutes . this was very very frustrating . maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one , but i would n't take that chance again . i wish i could give this device a worse rating , somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate .
0	this item , produced and marketed exclusively for the iaudio x5 , is entirely useless . the carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself . the only way to insert the device into the limited size and shape of this carrying case would be to cut the case wide open with scissors . even if one could somehow manage to squeeze an iaudio into the tiny case , the designers forgot to install an opening for the charger . i returned mine immediately . if you order this item you will be frustrated with a poorly designed , ill-fitting , unacceptable piece of worthless junk
1	we 've only had ours a week and i wish we 'd bought it sooner . the photos are sharp and every bit as good as commercially printed ones . i like it that they are dry and can be handled right away unlike my big hp printer 's photos which stay sticky for some time . having this gives such freedom to print and print photos to enclose in letters , to use in scrapbooking , and to frame for your home or for gifts . really convenient and takes very little space on the desktop
0	i purchased this flash card in june for my gps memory . loaded fine , but only lasted 3 months . card lost all it 's memory and was unable to take a new load . very disappointed in the life of the card .
1	this salamander designs rack is very well made and looks great . it takes a few hours to assemble , but the result is nicer than most home theater furniture out there . unfortunately , amazon 's shipping ( via ups ) did n't go so well and the outer box arrived in very bad shape . i was hoping that the inner box would protect the item , but , alas , one of the two doors was damaged . i 'm now trying to get amazon to replace the door , but they can only exchange the whole unit . the shipping box is completely destroyed , so i 've been forced to contact the manufacturer directly . crossing my fingers..
0	the one i ordered works , but the plastic nub in the rear of the unit i received has a slightly-flawed location . the nub is intended to insert into the ground hole of your recepticle ( outlet ) . my nub is slightly too high , preventing it to be plugged into a top outlet -- because of this nub , it 'll only work in the bottom outlet . i see little reason for this plastic protruding nub to exist in the first place..
0	i bought it , and usb was fine , but the firewire ports did n't work . lost time and money sending it in for warranty service
1	i got this monitor along with a keyboard . when i get home i plug my laptop into both and i have a huge screen to do my work on . the colors are terrific , the mouse works seamlessly across the laptop screen and the big auxilliary screen . wish i had done this a long time ago
0	the sony mdr-if3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear . perhaps , if one were an elf or a small child , they would fit properly ; however , if you 're like me , a mere adult mortal , they probably wo n't fit you . they would be okay for simple stereo listening , but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description . if you 're looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie , the sony mdr-if8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money
1	this is our first lcd tv . our tube tv finally died . my wife actually picked out this unit and consumer reports also recommended this unit . we purchased it directly from amazon on january 23 , 2007 . i wanted to wait a couple of months before i write my review to see if anything happens . but to my surprise the tv is still running and there have been no problems . we have digital hd and the pictures are great . it took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching tv with such sharp color and contrast . however , if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat . but overall its a good buy for us
1	this pny 2.0gb card has proven to be plenty as a digital camera card . we purchased the 2 gig card for my wife 's canon powershot s-900 `` elph '' to replace smaller memory cards . although 1gb cards worked adequately with the `` elph '' we noticed , early on , that its 10.0 mega pixels quickly filled up the photo card . the 2.0gb holds many more photos ( over 400 shots and counting ) than the 1gb . at half the price of other brands , the pny is proving to be very satisfactory ( we purchased two 2.0s at once ) . we happily recommend the pny 2.0gb photo card for your photos . it makes a great gift candidate . get yours soon !
1	it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive . i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in . this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords , which is a big plus to me . the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin .
1	the sony str-dg600 7.1 has worked as expected and is a high-quality system at a great price
1	i used to buy those cheap $ [ ... ] red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets , just to have some fun , but the batteries did n't last long enough and the beam was n't bright at all , not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round . i bought this one thinking that it would be really cool because it was green . i thought the high price tag was pushing it just for a little green dot , but it is much more than i thought it would be . the beam is clearly visible in the dark and you can even see the dot on the blackest street in the middle of a sunny day . the range is incredible and makes street signs reflect hreen shimmers ! i love it ! a much better buy than those crappy red ones , and the aaa batteries are easy to replace and last much longer
1	well-made hard case that is virtually a necessity to protect the tungsten e2 which comes with a flimsy , cheap flip case
0	i bought this because i wanted an encrypted device that i could use to offload personal documents i receive while traveling for work , and then read them using my mac ( s ) at home . lexar jd ii is the only product i found advertised to work with both macs and pcs at the same time . my primary mac is an intel mac . early on i realized the encryption utility only runs on ppc macs . okay , so i figured i 'd use it on the ppc mac mini , and everything seeemed fine at first . then i hit a problem where my mac mini could not read video dvds . a little search on the mac support forums , and i found that installing lexar jd software disables video dvd support on my mac ! fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall . aside from the problems with the macs , i also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned , which is that you must be logged in as a local administrator to use the encryption software under windows . since my work pc is a member of a domain , i had to create a local account , log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway . kingston data traveler elite works fine under windows domain logins , unfortunately for me they do n't have mac software yet . so in summary the current lexar encryption software : - ca n't be used on a windows domain machine - ca n't be used on an intel mac - breaks the dvd on a ppc mac it 's not for me ! however if you are using the lexar strictly on stand-alone windows pcs , or you do n't require encryption , it should be okay .
1	i 've had hp and lexmark printers in the past . this canon outshines both of the other brands . it is super easy to install without any troubleshooting . works like a charm . the prints looks great
1	i 've never tried verbatim media , since there were 5inch computer floppy disc ( circa 1983-85 ) . i pleased to find that verbatim still makes a quality product
0	i ordered several ink cartridges at one time and was appalled when i received a slew of large boxes to deliver my order . the increased cost of shipping the cartridges separately made one magenta cartridge go from $ 9.35 to $ 14.93 . all the cartrides arrived within a day of each other . i would rather pay for one shipment rather than separate ones .
0	expecting big sound and good fm station reception , buy something els
1	received exactly what i ordered at a fair price
0	let me start by saying i was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going . i imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up , or find them if we got lost ( or god forbid worse ) . i bought two from amazon and bought two more from a local retailer while waiting for the amazon order to arrive . i took my girlfriend 's niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked ... five minutes later mine locked up . i went and found my niece ... '' uncle xxxx , why does the screen look all funny '' the units from the local retailer had a problem with the screen locking up ... so i exchanged them , but then , so did the two i got in exchange . i thought perhaps i got a bad batch from the local store , but when the amazon units arrived , they had the same problem . we took them out for a stroll with some friends from mba school ... the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers ... '' dude , these % ! '' . forget , locating the people in your party , even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks . ( i should know , i was so excited when i ordered the radios that i applied immediately for a gmrs license with the fcc ) . the rino 530 's simply do n't work well . a combined gps and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product , but at $ 400 a unit , they are pathetic . $ 1600 for four units bought me disappointment , frustration , trips to the store and time on the phone with customer service agents who act surprised that there is a problem . frankly , the gps is useless because the screen flips out every seven minutes . you have to stop , remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot ... then it happens all over again a few minutes later . the product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity ... you wind up thinking how great it was when you had $ 20 radios that worked . i spoke with three garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem , one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected . every seven minutes ? come on , windows 95 was more stable than that . finally , i got a guy on the phone who said , `` oh yeah , there 's a problem with the 530 's , you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can . if not we can send you some more , but i ca n't make any promises . '' he explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the lcd and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution . reading the other reviews , i 'd guess they 've been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now ... and through multiple software releases . i am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair . i 've certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases ( linksys routers for instance , palm treo 's ) but this is no $ 50 router , ( or generally stable $ 400 phone ) and frankly , i have to reset my router once every four months at most . this product is really bad , i wish it were better because the concept is great , but i would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache .
0	i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online . well , i just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs , i got one that burned good . not much bang for the buck . i have burned many discs but never memorex , usually verbatim or ridata or mam . very disgruntled with these discs making coasters . maybe my burners do n't like them but whatever the case , i wo n't buy them ever again . i thought memorex made good products
0	i got this and the rangebooster is a lie . it has not boosted any kind of range on my network . it also goes in and out of service often . i wasted my money on this one
1	it 's a good quality notebook bag that can fit 17 '' laptops/notebooks easily . balances well on your shoulder ( unlike some bags that rest lopsided ) . good , strong stitch . it can get heavy , but then again you 're carrying around a 17 '' laptop
0	no where near as easy to use as my old system , but with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your projects.but one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alter the way dvds play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks , burner or what..after some experimenting i did confirm that it was actually the labels i was having so much fun making ... it might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing..dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
0	i sincerely hope ipods have improved ... i bought a 30g ipod photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently , outside the warranty ( which of course goes from original purchase date , not replacement date ) , it 's kaput again . now if i have to pay $ 275 for apple to fix or replace a three month old player ! no way . three players on the blink , each after a few months - that is n't just bad luck . that is n't even mentioning the difficulties with the itunes software or if you change computers . i get a new pc and have to re-transfer 100s of cds ! how lame . that negates all the convenience of the large capacity ( i wish other mp3 players had the storage space the ipods have ) . i just ca n't justify spending more money to replace this limited , inferior pos again . so essentially over the last year i have spent about $ 1 a day to have a player and now i 'm left with nothing . i will be buying a different player . i will spend far less than $ 275 and get something that will last more than three months , is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an ipod ! unfortunately i ca n't transfer the music i spend hours and hours loading up ( over and over ) . what a waste of money and time
0	egad ! upon receiving this remote control , i found that it requires four aaa batteries . there was no mention of that requirement in the product description ! i concur with the other review writer : the control is top heavy , and i would add poorly designed . it 's thick at the top and thin at the bottom , making it unwieldy . i will be returning this monstrosity
0	i bought this antenna hoping that it would improve signal strength as they advertised 6db on the box . the performance was worse than the original 2db antenna that came with my wireless adapter . back it goes
1	this product is fantastic . great sound with a small footprint . i purchased a jbl on stage at first and it malfunctioned after only a few days . the cta product has been great and it cost a lot less than the jbl product
0	i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online . well , i just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs , i got one that burned good . not much bang for the buck . i have burned many discs but never memorex , usually verbatim or ridata or mam . very disgruntled with these discs making coasters . maybe my burners do n't like them but whatever the case , i wo n't buy them ever again . i thought memorex made good products
0	unreliable pile of 'you-know-what ' . worked fine for about 2 months then refused to power up . fresh batteries , no go . called customer `` service '' . outsourced call center to india ; rep followed generic script telling me to : 1 ) use lithium-ion batteries , and 2 ) press `` power + nav '' simultaneously . as suspected , bogus advice . fresh batteries metered out to 1.62 volts each / 4.84 volts total . yes , i tried lithium-ion batteries anyway . still no-go . am still waiting for magellan/thales to respond . am still owner of unreliable gps . still have about $ 400 invested in unit plus software and maps . still kicking myself for buying a magellan product . do n't do it . really -- do n't do it
1	i received my package within three days via the super saver shipping ( cost me nothing ) . the printer is great , too . i used the brother 1440 series before and now upgraded to hp and i 'm impressed . the printer shoots out the first page immediately without having to warm up , and its very light weight and small size making it more portable . i love it
1	i 've had mine for 10 months now and it 's been very reliable ; not one problem with it . it 's quick to print out the first page , the display is a monochrome lcd with a backlight so you can see in dark spaces ( say , if you keep it under a counter ) , no paper jams , no nonsense . also , if you 're an apple owner the drivers are already included with os x ; truly plug n print . what 's a real treat is to combine it with an apple airport express and use apple 's bonjour software to easily convert it to a wireless network printer . bonjour is available for both os x and windows computers , and is a breeze to install . i highly recommend if you 're in the market for a multifuntion monochrome laser printer machine that is compatible with both windows and mac os
0	very clear image ! probably the best that i saw on this kind devices ! no software availble . device is useless if you do not have windows media os . absolutely no linux support . good hardware ... but useless ... you have to buy software for ~ $ 70-120 to be able use it ...
0	this tv only worked for three weeks . then , for no apparant reason , it suddenly would not turn on . i sent it back to coby for servicing and they sent it back still broken and with a new crack on it . no one should by from coby
1	i live in an apartment building and play ( well , practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so i would n't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs tv about 6 feet from where i sit and play . the 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing , so i would n't have to use an extention cable ( and usualy end up with feedback/distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable ) the volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so i do n't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings i like to use when not using headphones . makes it real nice too when using an instructional cd or dvd i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head . very light weight . some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads ' . fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere . cord enters headphones on the left ear side , so you do n't have to deal with the classic 'y ' split cord . easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way . earpices fit nicly over my ears ( no pinching , gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear ) and does a very nice job blocking out noise ( when my wife is awake she watchs the tv , rather loudly , which is right next to me and i bairly notice it ) . plenty of padding around the ear pieces . many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear , but these headphones i honestly do n't feel anything against my ears . even after several hours of use each night . sound quality . bose or pioneer they are not , but then if you wanted such high quality you would n't be shopping in the $ 20 and under headphones : ) that being said they are very good for sound . sounded very good on a portable cd player . only drawbacks i can see is that a person with large/tall ears wo n't get thier ears covered by the earpads . the inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1/4 inchs tall by 1 3/4 . imo they could have been made bigger . also , if you have a tall head ( good distance from top of head to ear ) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears . i have a head like drew carry ( give you an idea head size/shape i 'm talking about ) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they would n't have fit . i wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones do n't interfere , bind , pinch or anything like that with my glasses . so , i highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after ( i do n't recomend things often : ) )
0	price reflects quality . poor sound quality , no features , not that easy to use . do n't waste your mone
1	i bought this switch last week . the installation was as easy as plug n play . no major problems so far . this switch is worth its price
0	i bought this speaker about one year ago from best buy , very disappointed . the sound quality is terrible , i have two presence channel $ 15 klh speakers that sound better than this . no high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic , hence why bose is not high end . after a year of misery on my ears , i 've replaced this with a paradigm center speaker that only cost $ 20 more , and the difference is not even comparable . do not buy this , or any bose product at all . save your money and buy paradigm , b , or similar , most of the time they cost a little bit more , but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers , and you will get your money 's worth
1	if you like to listen to audio tapes you will like this one . replacing the provided headphones is a good idea . fm reception a little weak , but the tape play time on one aa battery is amazing . lightweight and good quality for the price
0	any pictures that i have printed with the color cartridge have come out too dard
1	i use this product with tiki navigator navigation s/w to connect my garmin gps 76 map to my laptop . this product was recommended by tiki navigator to use because it was previously reviewed as performing perfectly , which it does . it installs easily and with the blue led allows you to see if power is still connected . highly recommended
0	should have believed all the other negative reviews . did n't work in my honda civic and did n't work in my nissan altima , both with original manufacturer tape decks . in both cases , the tape deck whirred for a bit , then ejected the smartdeck
1	i had an old palm m100 for the longest time and used it as an electronic replacement for a paper organizer . but it ate batteries and was n't rechargeable , so when i got a newer computer without a serial port ( and discovered it would cost a fairly decent sum for a serial-usb connector ) , i decided to upgrade . thought it 'd be cool to have something with mp3 playing capabilities as well , ( i do n't own an ipod or other small mp3 player ) but i did n't need many features beyond an organizer ( did n't need for e-mail , etc ) and did n't want to spend much over $ 75 . pros : i like the palm interface , very intuitive . calendar contacts work well plays mp3 's syncs well with outlook/computer plugs in to recharge ; all cords came with it . easy to download new software ( i recommend blocks , it 's similar to tetris ) cons or caveats : display : when viewing calendar in `` full month '' mode , i have trouble seeing any entries unless i view the screen at an angle . not a deal-breaker , but a little odd . they probably improved this with newer ( pricier ) models , but you get what you pay for . i can read all other screens just fine . have n't used it to display photos ; i do n't think i 'd use this to do that -- resolution is n't worth the effort . expansion card : warning : will not read any card over 1gb size ! ( i had purchased a 2gb card with the intent of putting mp3 's on it and listening to them on the zire . would n't read it . did n't realize this till i read the fine print . fortunately , i have a camera which takes sd cards so i can use in the camera ) . listening to mp3 's : this really is n't gon na replace an ipod for features . they do say that listening to mp3 's uses more battery than other functions . i would agree but then i 've not used this for long periods of time as an mp3 player , so i ca n't really say . functionally , mp3 's play just fine with realone player . sound quality is pretty good but i have noticed a `` hiss '' background noise when using earbud-style headphones ; it 's a lot less noticeable with `` outside-the-ear '' style headphones . recommendation : outside-the-ear style headphones with an in-line ( cord ) volume control . if you 're in a quiet environment , the lowest volume level on the realone player is n't all that soft . with non-volume-adjustment headphones , the lowest volume level ( there 's a slider bar on screen ) was the loudest i wanted to hear . headphones with a volume adjustment fixes that problem . overall , it 's been worth the $ $ for me as a replacement for my former m100 , and it works ok as an mp3 player , as long as you can recharge it on a regular basis
1	drive got to me timly , installed per instructions , and works wel
0	i 've had a 660 printer a couple of years and gone through 6 color cartridges . four of them had a couple of the jets clog after 1 or two weeks . running the head cleaner just wastes ink ( a lot ) without opening the clogged jets . then you have the choice of throwing away a $ 30 cartridge you 've hardly used or printing with gaps . i will not buy another hp printer . i 've wasted more on cartridges then the printer cost
1	i do n't know what was wrong w/ the other reviewers machine , but let me assure you , this is not an inferior product . i got it on clearance @ target for $ 69.98 . i have been looking for a long time for a good portable dvd player . i have used it and had no problems with it whatsoever . plus if anything does happen in the first 90 it is fully returnable to target . good deal all around . highly reccomended .
1	i ca n't say enough about the tivoli am/fm radio ! it has superior sound and i love the design of the case as well . some folks might be hesistant to spend over $ 100 for a radio ... trust me - it is well worth it . my girlfriend 's parents have had an older version of this radio for over 30 years - still sounds great
1	i bought this so i can transfer video from my panasonic pv-gs300 camcorder to my pc . installation was easy and my computer was up and running in a matter of minutes . the is a great value considering they include a 6-pin to 4-pin firewire cable too . i highly recommend this product
0	we bought this clock radio , got it home , set it up , realized that it did n't have battery back up , called sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks ... .how bizarre ! ! they do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center ! boxed it up and it 's going right back where it came from . if it 's okay not to have battery back up , it might deserve a chance , however , what 's the use in having an alarm clock if you ca n't trust that it will indeed wake you up
0	like other users have experienced , this unit is no longer functional after 18 months . the wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights . poor product netgear
1	works like a charm , the wi-fi sniffer in the software is definitely a big plus ! you can get details of the connection i.e . connection strength , ap name and etc . worth every penny
0	extremely disappointed , especially after having done a lot of research and read the great reviews that this product ( and the axion 7 '' player ) received . i bought it for my wife for a road trip and she was excited about the large screen and the ability to connect an antenna to watch tv . the player worked fine for the first dvd we tried , but after that the screen freaked out and went almost black . you could n't see a picture but you could hear the movie just fine . no complaints about the sound i guess , but what good is that if the screen does n't work ? needless to say i returned this as fast as possible . in fact , if i could rate it less than one star i would , since it did n't even last one day . terrible product
0	for $ 20 bucks ... after finally figuring out that i had to turn my mic inputs all the way up , i still ca n't get more than a -20db signal from my guitar ... save your money..
1	out of the box and into the attic . followed the instructions and i 'm receiving perfect signals for my 46 '' sony hdtv set from pensacola , fl ( approx 20 miles ) and mobile , al ( approx 50 miles ) . i did read the instructions and followed them , i believe the folks that are n't happy with this model did n't read and follow the instructions
1	at around $ 35 . these ultraears are a amazing deal . they have great base , mids , and highs . the seperation is good too . if you tweek your mp3 's sound you can realy dial them in . push them nice and tight in to your ear to get the best sound .
1	does exactly what it 's supposed to do . i live 30 miles from the stations and have a good amount of tress surrounding my house , but i still receive all the network channels and their subchannels perfectly . easy to install , too
0	i purchased my tv in dec 2004 . i did not purchase the extended warranty . these sets are have all kinds of video problems . myself and other lcd owners have called for in home service . the service company is qualxserv in home service . they want $ 350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty , and can not guarantee a fix . take it from me buy some other bran
0	let me start off by saying like some others out there , theses seemed like a dream come true . got my first pair ( yes i said first ) and used them with my existing motherboard soundcard . they sounded about the same as my old ones but that was to be expected . i was saving in the meantime for the ac-1 soundcard that goes w/ the head phones . one day i come home and go to play a game and no sound is coming out of the left ear and one of the lights on the vol control is dead . double check with oter pc 's and verify bad headset . ok no problem amazon was great with the exchange . got my 2nd pair in a week . i decided to wait til i got the soundcard to hook the headphones back up . got the card for my b-day and went to town and set every thing up only to find that the left rear channel was not working but if i pushed on th cord a little you could here a small sound . plus one of my 3 dvd roms now did not work on account of a irq conflict i believe . o ' well just bad luck i guess . sent it back , again amazon very good about it . soundcard sound ok with my old headphone but does not have eax or x-fi which alot of games use . today i got an email saying that amazon realizes there is a problem with the headpones and will not send me a replacement but will refund me my money and will take back the sundcard as well . so there you have it . razer seems to have issues with it 's production , thats what you get for outsorcing manufacturing . amazon was great and i 'm happy they did n't just ship me another pos
1	all electronics should work this easily . you hook it up , read the manual , play with it alittle bit and it works like a charm . i 've been using two ( home desk and car player ) for 5 years now . they just seem to last forever
1	this eton radio is the u.s. domestic version of the chinese tecsun pl-550 all-band pocket sized radio . the chinese version is legended in the native language and utilitarian in appearance and less expensive . the eton is , well , in english with slight curves . i have used and tested other tecsun produced radios , including the pl-200 ( eton 10 ) and the grundig etraveller vii . this radio , like the other tecsun models , has excellent frequency discrimination , as well as the ability to directly enter the frequency desired ( if you know it ) , or scan through the am , fm and many shortwave bands , find the stations you like and store their frequencies . closely allied , for example , fm stations within 200 khz ( only the strongest will be heard on most commercial fm receivers ) of each other , can be picked up with clarity , positioning the manuverable whip antenna . very , very few radios , excepting expensive car radios , can boast such performance in the unites states . now on the market are other comparable radios , all made by tecsun in china using the very same sophisicated reception circuitry regelated previously to expensive shortwave receivers . this model has other features as well : two preset wake-up times for programs from preselected stations , scanning of all bands for stations and an antenna trimmer which permits optimizing reception on weakly received broadcasts , some 500 station memories and special reception selectivity for shortwave stations whose frequencies are almost overlapping . for the price , this radio is simply an excellent value , but people wishing to receive shortwave broadcasts are warned : shortwave reception from this radio , and every other shortwave radio for that matter , of stations other than the powerful broadcasters , benefits enormously from the use of an external long wire antenna . tecsun does provide a retractable wire antenna with the radio . alas , as with almost all radios this size , there is no single side band ( ssb ) reception , an enhancement that , defying digital technology , actually requires listener intervention to optimize and has great potential , but has , for the present at least , been consigned to the province of the technical listener more interested in ascertaining distant reception than actual broadcast information . the dalai lama for all his 5,000 watts ssb from tibet can not be heard on this radio . china radio shortwave , at 150,000 watts conventiona am shortwave , with canadian relay stations , does just fine . australian radio , at the same power , radio havana , radio serbia , croatia , russia , netherlands , sweden , india , israel , etc. , at lesser power , and some with and most without relay stations , are also heard clearly on the eastern seaboard during their times of broadcast - usually in the early evening est
1	i 've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years . i 've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday . i ride a motorcycle everyday and i never leave without these . first , the comfort is exceptional . even with my helmet on , i never get uncomfortable with these in my ears . i 've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems . even when i need a break from the music , i leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise . i 've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best , but most are painful with a helmet on . the `` bulb '' you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear , so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep . second , the sound quality is fantastic . great bass , mids , and highs . i 've heard things in my music i never knew was there and i ca n't wait to listen more . i ca n't recommend these enough . i 've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine
0	the lcd is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency . you may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately , like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas . even then , if you are in an are with good fm radio coverage it 's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work . mostly you ca n't use this with a cover on and you 'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long . the all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution
1	i 'm sure these earphones work and sound fine but i was looking for something softer/smaller for my apparently small earholes . :
1	i gave my son a garmin 60c for christmas last year . tinkered with it for a couple of days before handing it over . it worked well . of course i wanted one for myself , but cash is cash , so i 've been putting it off . ( side note - i wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring , and when they went to get it , it had been stolen from their car map-pocket . it seems these are high-theft items ; keep'em on a short leash . ) my wife had n't gotten me any `` big '' christmas gift , so i told her i knew what i wanted , and started shopping . i debated between the explorist 500 and 600 . chose the 600 , with its altimeter and thermometer . probably could have lived without them , but hey , it 's christmas ! it came yesterday , so i charged it a bit , and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover . i had to go out to the street for the garmin to find satellites . took it out for a spin today . spot-on navigation as i ran errands . it tracked back almost to the exact spot i had marked for home , though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate - so it 's off by a few feet . ( maybe it still thinks it 's in britain ? ) now - why only 4 stars ? 1 ) the usb connector can attach to the unit either way . there 's no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go . i called the 800 # and spoke with someone ( in new delhi ) who had heard this a lot . she told me what to do , and the pc immediately recognized the gps file system - as a removable disk drive , as advertised . i really find their website information near-zero . something as elementary as this should be covered on a website after the 3rd call , eh ? 2 ) i bought the mapsend 3d topo software . i am interested in elevations . and it has detailed street maps . but - they 're not routable ! if you want routable streets ( where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow 's flight direct path ) for following in a car , then either you have to get both map products , or choose . it 's rather frustrating . and the sales information provided on amazon and the magellan sites does not make this critical lack very clear . it tells you what you can do , but not what you ca n't and there 's no product comparison to see what the differences are . on the mapsend topo box , it says very clearly , `` navteq roads and streets data - like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems ( non-routable ) '' . er , excuse me , then it 's not quite like that found in expensive car systems , is it ? i concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage ( on amazon and magellan ) more obfuscating than informative . why ca n't someone create a simple comparison chart for all the various map packages
0	my printing problems began two months after warranty expiration . i tried every troubleshoot i could find , three times . what a beautiful machine . it does everything very well . it even looks great sitting there on the desk . but what if it stops printing , then what good is it ? i finally gave up and bought something else
0	i bought an airplay2 from am apple store for around $ 60 . other than the fact that `` blank '' fm stations are hard to find in the new york metropolitan area , and that you need to keep changing to different `` blank '' stations as you drive , the product itself is simply terrible . even if you are in a parking lot , and find a `` blank '' fm station , the quality of the music the airplay broadcasts is very bad . the bass is almost non-existent , and there is a constant hiss in the background that you can not get rid of . this product is not worth buying , especially for $ 60
1	nothing much to comment about on an ink cartridge ... it works as it should . if they could only reduce the cost of these things then i would be impressed
0	so i really like this case besides the velcro . basically i have it with me all the time and use it frequently . the only thing is that each time i take my hp ipaq 4155 out , the velcro makes the loudest noise i have ever heard and everyone looks up and stares at my case . i would n't recommend this one ... i am actually shopping for one that snaps or zips
1	this sharp electronic dictionary is the perfect pocket companion for those times when you do n't have your laptop , or a dictionary handy . the interface is intuitive and the keyboard is amongst the best i 've ever used on this type of device . moreover , the access times for dictionary and thesaurus lookups are very fast ; the `` phrase search '' function is a little bit slower , but not intolerable . there are also `` crossword puzzle '' and `` anagram solver '' functions that i have not used , but i imagine work fine . another positive for this product is the fact that it uses a single aaa battery , not some watch-type cell battery . the only negative is that it does not have a backlight for the screen , but neither do many of the other comparable dictionaries . hopefully sharp will smarten up and put that in a future version of the pw-e550 . i believe this is by far the best electronic dictionary you can get for less than $ 100 , and no , i do not work for sharp electronics
1	it does everything i expected to do . easy manual and set up . great sound . i am keeping it
0	this printer works fine as a usb printer , but it does not connect to a network . hp will not replace , says it must be something wrong with my network . nevermind the 2 other printers , 2 macs , and 3 winxp computers connected to it . no more hp for me
1	ok , i got this as gift so i got nothing to lose right ! well , this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i got ta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle . ever since i unpacked this little thing , it has been with me everywhere ! on the go , exercise , sleeping ... .anywhere you have pockets to put it , ipod shuffle is always with me whenever i needed some kick of tunes , its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 gb of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime , it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me ... lol ! sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer/update tunes on the go . so if you are a fast paced , mobile and not a control freak , then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it
0	i purchased this headset to wear to the gym to tune into their tv 's to watch programs rather than listen to music . reception was horrible ! ! ! while i was in the gym i tried just listening to the radio and could n't even get that to come in clear . the only time it was partially clear was if you were standing outside and it was clear skies ! not impressed at all ! i will be returning this and maybe buy the $ 12 generic set instead
0	i have this setup with my new laptop that runs vista premium . the device installs ok and it works with media center . it 's great for watching tv , but if you have scheduled recordings and you like to have your machine be in `` standby '' mode until it 's time to record , you may be disappointed . when coming out of standby , sometimes the tuner is recognized and at other times it is not . when it 's not recognized , i have to unplug and then replug the device in order for it to be recognized . because of this , i have missed several recordings . i contacted pinnacle support and their recommendation was not to use standby .
1	my [ ... ] girl and [ ... ] boy both love their players . the [ ... ] really likes the sonic games and the ability to connect it to the tv . on a tv the 8 bit graphics are jagged but he does not care and the games are playable . the builtin screens are a little low in resolution if you look closely but cartoons look good and the kids have not noticed anything . the players have a nice lock feature to disable the controls so that the movie is not accidentally stopped . they have both dropped the players serveral times and they both continue to work well . the only problem is that the [ ... ] had figured out how to remove the battery pack . she does this at times then gets upset the movie stopped . the players come with everything , ac and auto adapters , a remote control , earphones , built-in stand , battery pack and the wires to play the movies and the games directly on an a tv with rca jacks
1	works great . had to remove the brown plastic fitting from the antenna wire that encased the actual metal connector to the cradle . other reviews pointed this out so it was n't a big deal , just had to be done carefully .
0	i ordered this cable a few weeks ago . although i must say that it does work fine , the cable looks cheap ( in fact , it is very thin ) and its length is less than 6 feet . as you may agree , length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that . so for $ 20 ( including shipping ) , i think it was not exactly a good deal
0	after about 3 weeks of operation , the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy . looking for a better option
0	i mean seriously guys , is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card . there is an easier way to do it ya know . for your psp , if the game is really important to you and you ca n't save it . just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off..it will go on hold and next time you wan na play it again.. just push it back up..and hopefully if you did it right you 'll have the game right back in the place you left it..hey it saved me 50 dollars..and it can do the same thing for yo
0	i spent $ 60 on this and it broke after 6 months.. i guess the old saying , `` you get what you paid for '' is true . : (
0	the light makes my computer very sluggish , even when my laptop is not running off of the battery . browsing the internet , especially , is painfully slow , and i am on a high-speed cable connection
1	after looking at $ 250.00 mounts , i was unsure about order at this low price . this is a great , well built unit . i would have no problem putting a 130 lb . unit on it if you follow the enclosed instructions . hardware for most walls included . well painted with no rough edges . mine was installed over wall board into wood studs . i used the awl to make sure i hit the studs dead center . delivery from new york to sarasota , fl . was 5 days . ca n't bet that
0	the product did n't do what it said it would . i cut the power to use it in my car ( i should n't have assumed it worked properly ) so i could n't return it and ended wasting $ 50 . i was extremly dissapointed in this product
0	basic connectivity and wireless work . any attempt to use advanced firewall rules fail including vpn passthrough . this device could not have gone through even a rudamentory test cycle . please read the reviews , this is common and these problem were confirmed by my it dept and also by d-link 's tech 's as well . on second one , all of the exact same problems . sad to have made a choice , hope they make it right
1	i just bought my first laptop computer and really , really hated the touchpad . i found it unresponsive at times and found the whole right clicking and using the pad at the same time a pain . i spent a while browsing the different mice available on this and other sites and in the end decided upon this little number . i am very happy that i did too . its pretty small and very lightweight but at the same time it doesnt feel at all fragile - definately well made . im about 5'11 and have fairly big hands - i find this mouse comfortable to use . it looks pretty cool too , the red panels on the side light up , which is always good for night work . all the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month . i couldnt ask for better all round performance . and for $ 20 you really cant go wrong , it really is a great price for a microsoft mouse . the only reason i dont give it five stars ? ? well this is technology - although it is a awesome piece of kit , there are always other things or features they could have added
0	i was not sent a firewire cable as was advertised . they sent me a useless usb cable . when i contacted the seller , they did not send me the proper cable . do n't buy from this terrible company !
0	cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit . the included software does contain viruses . the included software is a reminate of the late 80 's to early 90 's . the tablet itself does not work under win2000 nor winxp . under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again . this unit would be great , if it came out 7 years ago . you get what you pay for
0	i bought this because i wanted a cheap no-frills phone with answering system , but it 's performed very poorly compared with the one i had previously . specifically , it 's very hard to hear anything on this phone , even with the volume set to maximum . definitely not worth buying
1	i installed this unit on my hp amd 64 x2 with a 19-inch lcd monitor . installation was very straightforward , with no problems experienced . the unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total . all are surge protected , but only one row has battery backup . each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets . the unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line , and interacts well transparently my dsl service . the unit comes with a usb connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer . also included is `` powerchute personal edition '' software . this software replaces the ups option used under the `` power '' icon of widow 's xp control panel . powerchute pe allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user 's needs . powerchute pe automatically loads at computer startup , and resides as an icon on the right-side of the window 's task bar . it monitors the unit 's status , and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference . in order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly , i only attached the pc and monitor to the powered row of outlets . transformers seem to use a lot of power , and to gain the most time available for adequate shut-down times they should only be plugged into the `` surge only '' outlet row . when a/c power fails , the unit immediately picks up the power load . it will then begin to shut down the pc if a/c power does not become available shortly . the default method it uses is to place the pc into `` hibernation mode '' , saving the desktop exactly `` as is '' for future start-up . it accomplished this task with my pc perfectly . if i had wanted a ups to keep my computer running for several minutes during an a/c power outage , this is not the unit i would have purchased . however , to keep my system from re-booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily , or to shut down the pc safely should the power outage last longer , this is a cost-effective solution for those tasks .
1	i have been happy with these phones . i find no problem with the sound - no static at all . the only small thing i have noticed is that occasionally the sound echoes a little . i do not understand the terrible reviews - this phone is very usable
1	easiest remote to program . has tremendous ability to tweek . will keep recommending to all my customers
0	i purchased this item recently at a local radio shack because it was on sale for $ 7.99 . in my case , i did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered , but i did get a disappointing one . i use an older cd writer ( nec nr-7800a ) which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of 16x , and i have achieved that speed with other media ( notably imation ) . in my system , however , these sony discs are limited to a maximum of 8x no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used . either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive . on the positive side , all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my dvd-rom drive , dvd player , and cd player . there 's no point in buying this sony product when there are so many others out there . find a brand that works well with your burner and stick with it . update : the current model number on sony 's web site for the 50-pack cd-r spindle is 50cdq80ls3 ( not 50cdq80ls2 ) . if you still want to buy sony , try to find the current model number
0	heres the thing about batteries . they eat people . yeah . you can never trust a battery , cause those things are heartless . especially rayovac ... those give me the creeps . *shudder* so the next time you think about buying batteries , think about b.e.p.-batteries eat people . dont even think about it , punk
1	bought this to convert pal hi-8 ( canon ) purchased years ago in singapore for mac ( powerbook g4 , tiger os-x ) nonlinear editing . worked perfectly the first time , only needed to set a single switch to select pal . no need for software drivers etc . happily plugged and played with the mac and the camcorder . acceptable price for the features and ease of use .
0	i used this maybe 4 times when the `` in '' stopped functioning , but it mysteriously *would* work in reverse . i wish i read other people 's reviews on this before i bought it . horrible waste of money
0	this is a terrible product . if you can get it to print , the labels look great , but it will only print a few labels before stops for no reason that i can find . i get an error that it did n't print but no reason why . i 've installed on two different pcs , one is brand new and same thing happens . software is also pretty useless . it also prints many blank labels which gets quite expensive . the online help is a joke and the technical support take 48 hrs to respond .
1	the bci-3ebk is good quality black ink for an inkjet printer . i have used this ink for a couple of years now and do n't recall it smudging on the pages i print . the price on this product ( compared to hp products ) is fair , but i am able to print a 100 to 200 pages before running out of ink . of course , you will get more pages out of this cartridge if you print more color graphics than text
0	i purchased dvd express and it never worked . i spent endless time with tech support . the old story about , `` it must be your computer . '' did not fly either , my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ads . i exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before i got it . same problems . tech support told me i was the only person having trouble with this product . they need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones . my only mistake was not reading them before i wasted my time and money . ads also told me it would not work with ulead 's movie factory 3 , some of the software it came bundled with , but that was uleads problem . i should use cap wiz ( their program ) duh ! ! ! guess what , it did not work with their program either . ulead said they had several complaints with ads 's product . their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work . save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product ! p.s . since ads does n't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade . i do n't think they want a product like that either . the only reason i gave one star is ... ..it was packed well . ju
0	i have 8860dn - it based on the same engine as this one , the only difference - wireless . so here is my experience - hope it will be helpfull . i was with hp for 15-20 years , needed mfp , read all reviews here and decided that mfc-8860dn will be a good choice ( other option was hp 3055 ) . it has everything i need - copier , network print , scan , fax . easy setup ( i am in it for 25+ years ) . everything was almost perfect . the only complaint you need to keep in mind - it eats 1100 watts when starts printing - light could flash . it was ok , until i reached 1500 pages mark - it start printing small dots every ~3 '' . no problem - need to clean everything ( per my experience and confirmed on brother 's web site ) . cleaned - it was the biggest mistake - all outputs were with tons of small dots all around the page . called support 2 times . after few hours of troubleshooting - they advised me to replace drum . hey - its only 1500 pages , nowhere close to promised 25000 ! after i mentioned it , they offered me 75 % discount on it . what 's about warranty ? sorry . i spoke to supervisor , he explained that support in philippines ca n't do it , the only option - to call usa office . i replaced drum . now counter shows around 2000 pages and i have same problem again . hey , i heard this before - never say never . still as of today : i would never , never buy brother printer/mfc again ! ! !
1	i use this on my macbook . works flawlessly to hookup a tv via svideo . osx handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that i use when i have it hooked up . plug it in and video switches to tv settings , unplug it and its back to normal . i use this with dual view mode so that my desktop stays the same always on the macbook , and i just get extra desktop space when i plug the tv in . the quality is quite suprising for s-video , very good . 100 % must have for anyone that has a nice tv :
1	i originally bought this cd case for my car , because i listen to cds the most while driving . this was not a good case to bring back and forth at all . it is very large and heavy ( even without cds ! ) , and the long zipper-tail makes it hard to open with one hand . i now use it to house computer software and playstation/gamecube games . for what you pay , it is an excellent buy
0	hi ! i bought my cyberhome 300 in april 2006 , and was able to set the region code to `` 0 '' to watch all dvd 's . after not using the dvd player for a few weeks ( and unplugging it ) , the region code has automatically set back to `` 1 '' and i can not change it anymore ! what happened ? ? when i try to change it now i can only choose between the settings `` 1 '' and `` - '' . anyone who has the same problem ? thank yo

0	the bag is very nice looking , nice material , everybody loves it . lots of compartments inside fit all accessories i need plus some documents . but the top part ( the zipper ) is a big problem , it just has to get 200 % in a way , while the notebook pocket does n't provide any flexibility . i just have to scratch my brand new notebook in and out , very frustrating . ( same as another review here ) . my opinion , find another one , i 'm gon na do it myself
1	i bought the keyboard for my 5-year-old son . the keyboard is light weight and therefore easy to carry . small and convenient for my son to play anywhere . i am using batteries and really enjoy the freedom of movement , i.e . not needing to worry about plugging it into a power source . it 's an excellent choice for my situation
1	when my cds started skipping i thought they has seen the last days of spinning , however this disc cleaner has solved all problems . you simply put the cd into the cleaner with the label side down . then , you spray the disc cleaner to the disc surface . you only apply one even spray of cleaner . then , you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed . once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times , you can remove the disc and let it dry completely . most of the cleaner was absorbed into the cleaning pad after the recommended 5 rotations . i found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick . the first time i used this cleaner i was a bit frustrated with it because i noticed little pieces of black foam all over my cds . apparently , there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down , but once i removed that piece of foam , all was go . this unit comes with one additional cleaning pad . i think if you are just using this to remove fingerprints , you wo n't have to replace the cleaning pads very often . handy gadget to prolong disc life and restore performance to contaminated disc surfaces . ~therebeccareview.com
0	i had no problems burning to these discs , its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore . after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them , my discs started dying after a few months . in addition , in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become . this is true for all the discs ( about 150 of them ) . i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	n.e.w . will waste your time , money , and your every last nerve before repairing your product . eventually they will , but not without an exhausting , protracted fight
0	after having installed the unit for 43 days , the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting . this was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit `` flying '' ! very dangerous ! ! tomtom would not replace the unit , as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks ! buyer beware . see the tomtom forum for description and picture : [ ... ] and other links to the base issue

0	i have now been shipped two iskins for my 60gig , and both of them had the holes in the top in the wrong place . there are at least three flavors of 60 gig ipods in the marketplace at present , and more coming , it appears , so be careful which one you order . the manufacturer 's website is very confusing and unhelpful about identifying the correct model of skin , even if you know the model number of your ipod . i also agree with the other reviewer that the belt clip is a mistake . throw it away .
1	the service from amazon was great , delivery people were most cooperative , made delivery as promised , placed tv in space where we wanted and hooked up and checked it out . they even offered to take away the empty carton . we saved about $ 250 by buying from amazon rather than from local retailer
1	this was exactly what i needed it is very easy to use . it does a great job of encrypting your data , if that is what you want . there is plenty of space and it is snap to use with my mac powerbook . i recommend it
1	i used these speakers ( 4 ) as part of my 7.1 channel theater and i used the hti 55 center channel plus the hti 8 '' ceiling to finish off my system . i have a denon 2307ci pumping these speakers and let me tell you , i ca n't even crank up the system to the highest as these speakers rock my entire house from the basement ! ! ! these are the best in wall speakers i have ever bought ! ! ! ! buy them now before they 're all gone ! highly recommend
1	i had looked at numerous stands for my yamaha keyboard and did n't want to spend a ton of money for a professional grade stand ( at professional prices ) . with that in mind , the yamaha pkbx2 double x portable keyboard stand is a good choice at $ 29.99 . i had seen other stands that were not as sturdy ( single x stands ) and cost about the same price . tips for assembly : - do n't read the instructions , just look at the enlarged image of the keyboard on amazon and assemble the stand the way it 's shown . - the bolts for attaching the arms and legs come screwed in to the stand . use the ( included ) allen wrench to remove them . pros : - low price . - solid , sturdy stand . - works for just about any keyboard . - the stand 's height is fully adjustable , and can be done in several seconds - without having to unscrew anything . cons : - there is no way to attach a keyboard to this stand . no screws , bolts or straps are included , even though most ( including my yamaha ) keyboards have pre-drilled holes for screwing the board to a stand . the keyboard simply sits on top of the stand . i was very disappointed about this . - the included allen wrench did not work for one of the bolts . the bolt came screwed in to the stand way too tightly to be removed using the included tool . the allen wrench only stripped the bolt , it did not loosen it . luckily my husband had a better allen wrench of nearly identical size , and that one worked . without it , we would not have been able to loosen the bolt
1	i bought it in feb 2006 , never had any problem . occasionally it stops working and just restarting both the units ( sender and receiver ) fixes the problem . i am so satisfied i am buying another pair
0	bought new around $ 80 . cd player and lcd clock stopped working within 6 months -- now nap function and radio are all that works -- if only i could find the damn receipt ! ! !
0	this printer sucks ! it started out working wonderfully . then all of a sudden ( after the third month in use ) it started printing very slowly . then it decided it would n't print at all unless i completely shut down my computer everytime . something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge . it also uses the color ink when it 's not requested . i only needed the color ink a couple of times ( not for pictures ) and it went just as fast as the black . i used to love hp . they are now making garbage . i 'm thinking of looking at the oki brand . do n't waste your money on this one
0	i bought this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks . but , i soon found that it does not work well . after a few uses the gears began to stick . it would no longer crush/shave ice . stick with the smaller units
0	i have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to windows vista . as a result of the windows upgrade , this product just lost half its value for me . the drive works fine physically , but the included backup software will not work with vista when i try to schedule an overnight backup ; the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling . as others have noticed here , western digital offers zero support for its software - i can not even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem
1	after doing a fair amount of internet research about mp3 players and their features i was under the impression that i would go with an ipod . having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years i have never been fond of the mac and have always been a little biased towards pc 's . this added to my reticence to own a mac product and the growing complaints about service on the ipod being a 'bit ' over priced i forged on . i started reading through all of the reviews i could find on the internet and as always , found a wealth of them here on amazon . to my dismay all the reviews i could find on product names i knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely . thats is , until i got to the iaudio line . the reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things i could easily overlook . i love the control , i am big guy with big hands and i have rarely , if ever , pushed the control and not had the result i was intending . i have had my iaudio x5 for over a month and i have nothing bad to say in the least . i am an avid linux user and it works flawlessly with linux , the sound quality is phenomenal , except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those . the fm tuner is great ( you wont get that on an ipod ) . i travel a lot and i pipe my x5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port . what else can i say , this is a great product with great features and it looks good too ! i also bought a case from zcover which fits the purpose but i think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market . a satisfied custome
1	same as everybody else , i ordered mine a couple of days back and it has n't shipped ... i want it ! ! ! ! !
1	this is a great product for your mini . the armband is well-constructed from a neoprene-type material ( which does n't slip when you 're sweaty ) with heavy-duty velcro all the way around , and the ipod holder is securly screwed onto it . the rubberized skin keeps your ipod safe from sweat and provides some shock and scratch resistance . this is n't a super-cheap armband , but as they say , you ( usually ) get what you pay for . this should last you for years of gymming / running / biking
1	these earphones are incredible ! they are comprised of excellent bass and treble . you experience everything much nicely . these earphones compared to the ipod headphones are excellent unlike those raggety things . i bought these from ebay for $ 8 and for that amount of price , you ca n't regret buying these sensational earphones
1	this is the best photo printer i have seen . i work at a print shop and it tops the very expensive printers that i use . i am also a photograher and image and color quality is very important to me . i get excellent results with this printer .
0	the unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card . this requires determining the cf card id when registering . instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating magellan 's web site is tricky at best . if you enter the cf id incorrectly , you can not store any maps in the unit even if you are provided an authorization code for the cf card . beware
1	i bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new sony mhcec70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner . having once owned an earlier pm-series model , this new panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint . like its predecessor , the pm53 is a nice , powerful compact stereo with ( for the money ) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner , especially on the fm band . it can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses . the remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual . right now , this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning . sony 's competing models are cheesy-looking ( hog attention on store shelves , ) bigger ( i.e. , take more materials/cost more to ship , ) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified ( and of course , proprietary ) antenna connector . it 's like choosing between the pontiac and the toyota . the sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling . the panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture .
1	i have , and have had , lots of sw radios including a number of sonys . this is one of their many gems . great perfomance , lots of memories and snazzy look . good for travel ( certainly not as compact as the sw100 , of course ) . a great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio , and do n't want to spend very much . good for listening , and good for dxing while traveling . look no further
0	this router has been in operation for about 3 weeks . when it is functioning correctly , it is a pleasure to use . unfortunately , it requires almost daily power cycling to keep it running - all the idiot lights show normal operation , but there 's no wired or wireless connectivity until it 's power cycled
0	got the archos to be able to take it with me when i travel for work and have movies on my flights . the recording with the dvr station is great , but in order to hear what i recorded in a quiet room i had to have the volume turned up to 99 % . hearing the audio with any background noise is impossible . i contacted amazon and got a replacement , that part was great , but the new one i have to have the volume up to 80 % to hear anything in a quiet room . i also found the that for the jack out to tv you are required to by the archos cable as it has a different pinout than a standard cable that comes with your video camera etc . needless to say , i will be returning the ones i have an buying another hoping it was just a bad manufacturing batch
0	the minor problem is that the user manual claims the user id is `` admin '' . well , it is not . frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user id should be left blank to log in . the major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted . after twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network . once you unplug and plug back the power cord , it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours . i am used to rebooting windows every time it hangs , but i do n't accept having a wireless access point that hangs ( i am not sure how microsoft was able to convince me it is ok for an os to hang ) . this box is going back . i already bought a buffalo that works fine
0	this is an excellent item for anyone on-the-go who has an ipod nano . no longer do you need to carry those cumbersome cd 's around or get distracted while driving when a cd ends and you need a new one . why pay the big bucks for a cd changer player when all you need is this an ipod nano
1	i purchased this particular cb because of the front firing speaker . the size is perfect for in dash installations , and it is very user friendly . after installation i tested it out to 8 miles which was more then i expected . overall i 'm very pleased with the price and quality of this product
0	we got the hdmi cables , but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the website . the cables come without any packaging , and there is no indication anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website . we have not yet used the cables yet , and we 're not sure whether they will work or not
1	this works perfectly , and it is built very well . my picture looks great and sound is also great
0	after constant dropouts for the past 6 months and no help from the `` belkin bozo 's '' ( support ) . i received a long delayed canned e-mail answer to my problem which did n't help a bit . i finally got rid of this piece of junk and installed a linksys network card . both linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement . no more dropouts . i would suggest that prospective purchasers of belkin products hesitate before buying.. it 's one thing to have a product that works intermittantly , but it 's really frustrating when product support is worthless
1	this really works , i have 3 zp100 's and 1 zp80 , using a nas for storage of my mp3 's . the whole thing hangs together perfectly . if you want to get music through your whole house this is a great way to do it . most importantly tech support is great ! ! !
0	this is the worst pice of electronics i ever bought . started falling apart after few days only . battery life is a joke . software that comes with it is totally unfriendly and even if you manage to install that thing on your computer it wo n't work with os prior to xp . you will find that out after you 're done installing it . mediocre performance . do n't waste your money on this one .
1	i wanted a non-ipod digital music player , and found this to be a terrific option . it plays a number of different formats , and includes a lanyard , which is nice when commuting on the train , or for plane travel . i have only used alkaline batteries so far , and have had excellent battery life . the menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn , but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu , it 's pretty easy . i have also enjoyed the built in fm tuner , and have not any trouble with reception , even on a moving commuter train . the sound quality is very good . i 've been using 128 bitrate mp3 songs so far . the software for transferring music is pretty easy to use , although i did have a little trouble getting the player to be recognized as connected , which seemed to be some kind of order of connections issue . the included earbuds are n't the most comfortable , especially since i already lost the foam padding , but i will probably get a better pair anyway . they do sound good though . also , the included cases are pretty cheesy and i did n't even bother with them . a little hint : one thing i did not like was that because of the location of the on button , the unit can fairly easily be turned on when you have it stored in a bag or pocket . to combat this , simply turn the hold on . the unit wo n't turn on accidentally when it 's on
0	i got this case for my ws-320m , which i 've been wearing around my neck like a mp3 player . the material of the case seems to be genuine leather ( or really good vinyl ) and brushed felt . it looks good = professional looking . i 've enclosed what i hope are representative pictures of this case . all the buttons of the recorder are accessible . even when the flap is closed , the microphone/headphone jacks are available , as are the rec/stop/play buttons . if the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built-in microphone , you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well . there is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the `` hold '' button on the side of the recorder . not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around , but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the `` hold '' button . however , since the hold button is meant to slide down ( away from the microphone ) for it to be released , if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case , the resulting friction would actually unlock the `` hold '' button . the belt loop is an adjustable velcro . i would have preferred a sewn-on belt loop ( so the case can not come off the belt accidently ) or a nice stiff clip ( for easy access ) , or even a riveted snap button , but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options . most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general - they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times . the case is closed shut with another velcro strap , all in all , it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the recorder during transport . or , being able to put it on your belt after everything else ( line-in mic , headphone , recording/playing ) is set up . the relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case ( mainly due to very small buttons ) , as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand , would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case . the case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket , and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder . my bias lies in that i like to use it as an mp3 player , and i wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap/loop from a flash drive . placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone/mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such . i think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt . on one positive note , i believe this is the first time that i was the first reviewer for anything from amazon . woo hoo
1	we now have three of the k850 printers in use , one with a built in print server , second paper tray , and duplexer . so far , the printers have proved to be reliable , fast , and comparatively inexpensive to operate . power on , pre-print , and post-print noise may be objectionable to users who are located close to the printer . capable of using the same hp 10 black and hp 11 individual color ink cartridges , as well as replacement print heads as the hp business ink jet 1100d and hp business ink jet 1200d , the k850 shares the same low , per page operating cost as the 1100d and 1200d printers . full page color photographs print in roughly 32 seconds , with a roughly eight second delay prior to the start of printing ; similar prints from other printers may require from one to five minutes to print the same full page color photograph . white horizontal lines were present in the full page color photograph , possibly indicating that one or two of the nozzles in the print heads , shipped with the new printer , are defective . the printer handles paper sizes up to 13 '' x 19 '' , so it easily handles b size ( tabloid , 11 '' x 17 '' ) paper commonly used for small engineering prints and foldable newsletters . the printer software installs without problem , although a reboot will likely be required . for network capable k850 printers , the software install automatically finds k850 printers on the network , and adds a `` hp standard tcp/ip port '' to the computer configuration for communication with the printer . for non-network capable k850 printers , both usb and parallel port connections are supported . positives : * uses ink that is compatible with other printer models , helping to keep operating costs down . * fast printing for full page color , and even faster black printing with spot color . * large format color printing , which is helpful for quick generation of engineering prints . * nearly idiot proof print cartridge replacement - light turns on to indicate the color that needs to be replaced , printing stops automatically , user replaces ink cartridge , and printing continues . * separate ink cartridges and print heads means less aligning of print cartridges/heads after ink cartridge replacement , larger capacity ink cartridges , and lower operating cost . negatives : * minimal install of hp software from the cd requires at least 100mb . * low capacity hp 13 print cartridges ship with the printer . * power-on , pre-print , and post-print noise , just like the business ink jet 1100d and 1200d . however , there is very little noise produced while printing . * cheap plastic cover over the print cartridges , similar to that used on the 1200d . * large footprint
0	i bought the ads upconverter because i bought a hdtv only to find out that my cable co. did n't offer hdtv and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer hdtv ( too many trees around my house ) . i was n't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing hdtv picture , but for $ 550+ i was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable . when i first turned in on i asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought . she looked at the tv and said okay i 'm ready turn it on . i said `` it is on ! ! '' this is pretty much the reaction i had also when i looked at it . the image i got for my digital cable was certianly different , but that 's all it was , different . it was not noticably better . in fact , in some instances i though the picture was worse . i called ads tech support and they kept insisting i try it with my dvd because that is what the product is best for ( even though that 's not what i got it for ) . so i did and to be honest i really preferred the picture i got directly from my dvd over the picture i got after running it thru the upconverter . it did n't matter what display format i put it in it just did n't do anything to improve the picture . save your money . if you ca n't get hdtv do n't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing
1	simple , but does what it 's supposed to . allows you to connect the audio output of a laptop/pc/ipod , etc. , to the audio input on your tv .
1	the samsung i bought shows a great quality pictue . i love it
1	this router has worked great for the past year . we have 3 linux computers connected to dsl through it . one pc is at the far end of the house . we use two novatech powerline ethernet adapters to connect that pc to the netgear router through our home powerline wiring . netgear and novatech work fine together , with no dsl speed degredation . the browser interface is easy to use . the firewall features are easy enough for the inexpert user to understand . the manual is good , but i would prefer to have a hard copy
0	this cheap piece of plastic broke within 2 months of me owning it ! ! buyer beware !
0	its a good accessory for archos product , i have 604 wifi . its compatible with generation 4 archos devices . pros : 1 ) good build 2 ) enough connections to expand cons : 1 ) it very much costly as compare to it utility . 2 ) it comes with charger which should be a part of standard item . 3 ) there could be more cables included in this package like spdif , usb mini cable . 4 ) in this cost it could have a backup battery ( extra ) that could be part of ( built in ) the docking station , so that archos device can have longer play time . i think archos has a built in mentality of making as much as money they can , if it is then it would not go a long
1	the card is blistering fast . i just wish it did n't take a performance hit in vista . it also has several other odd issues that i 've become accustomed to when buying bleeding edge technology . ( e.g . the official drivers released in february 2007 are missing several features in windows vista . like good tv-out support , hibernation support , proper ntune support . the march 2007 released vista beta drivers seems to cause a lot of people to have video driver crashes during games . check nvidia 's message board for more info . ) once nvidia straightens out their vista drivers issues , this card will be golden . as it is , the latest beta drivers did improve performance ... but it introduced some stability issues . also , evga 's 90-day step-up program will hopefully allow me to jump into the 8900 series that is rumored to be released late-april 2007 . lastly ... it puts off an odd digital whine in 3d games and when resizing windows . i returned one ( with green circuitboard ) and got a new one form amazon ( black circuitboard ) and it did the same thing . amazon reimbursed me the return shipping ! the digital whine is n't too bad , but its fairly annoying if you have your game sound really low . i play with headphones , so i do n't really care
0	it worked ok for 2 months , but the kb kept on falling off . when i complained , i was told that the kb was not compatible with my viewsonic v37 . yet , it was advertised as compatible with the vs ppc 2002 . the worse came when i upgraded to ppc2003 and the kb stopped working . i contacted targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their kb drivers for this vs ppc . i do not believe that this should be permitted . if you sell something , stand behind it . very disappointing
0	i ordered this product and put it in my nikon d200 . the product was improperly manufactured , and caused the pins in my camera to bend , rendering it inoperable . i had no idea what the cause was , and went to my camera store , and ended up damaging one of their cameras as well . we took a quick look at the card , and the holes were obviously improperly aligned . the damage to the cameras was repairable , and the replacement card i received worked ok , but this is really not an acceptable situation for such an expensive piece of equipment
1	this thing is selling in the best buy with $ 53.33 + tax . i bought that in here for under $ 40 with free super saver shipping in jan . it 's working very well until now with my sonyericsson k800i
0	i have to admit , the main reason i purchased ( 2 ) of these dvc-1100 's was because of the stellar reviews posted here on amazon . i bought one for my in-laws and on for my wife and i so that they could watch our children grow up over long distance . great idea , bad solution . the main problem i had was that the camera lens is fixed , and does not focus . i waited 1 hour on the line with d-link tech support only to learn that the lenses on these cameras are designed to be fixed and only focus when you are approximately 6 - 8 feet away from the camera . unfortunately , the ones i got did not focus at all , and the video quality was absolutely terrible ( washed out color and bad contrast ) . please listen to me , save your money and do not buy the dvc-1100 . this device is cheaply made , and just not there yet..
0	i do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon.com , but this time as i was listening to my car audio today , i was compelled to leave one for others . this product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments i bought for mp3 player/audio system . its sound reproducing/transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality . it does not balance well the low/high frequency sounds , resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity . mine worked ok for the first several hours i assume . i think it damaged the speaker , and it now sounds like it 's going to rip apart . someone else left review explaing this trouble , which i ignored , which was a mistake . again , do n't buy .
0	i purchased this and shipped to us and finally had it delivered to india in gurgaon . iam a musician and i desperately wanted a good microphone . i record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this . but i wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike . the gain was lower than the ordinary mike , it doesnt work at all without the battery , but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory . unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres who 'll entertain me in delhi and i consider 70 bucks down the drain . : & lt ; ..
0	this portable tv sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design . they do n't tell you that there is no antennea nor that the tv will not work without an antennea ! the portable dvd player is great . the tv is horrible . when we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken . do n't buy this for the tv ! we ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in . this one was a total waste of money
1	this product is simple to use and has all of the functionality i need while presenting
0	my first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my hp deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing . i replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all . while repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested , the etch tore . when examing the inside of the printer , i found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage . the next new cartridge would not work either . $ $ wasted . tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure ( after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out ) . printer repair would cost me more a new one
0	did not work - never clicked no tech support waste of good mone
1	i bought the cooler for my dell inspiron which tends to get hot because i work it so hard - it 's cut down the time the internal fan kicks in drastically , is very sturdy yet light enough for me . so i bought another ( wide-screen ) ( black ) version for my hp pavilion which has more ram and so does n't have to work that hard , now its internal fan virtually never kicks in . in both cases the fan is so quiet that i have to turn it on/off to make sure that it is working . the only improvement i would suggest is more usb ports . 4 stars because 5 is perfection
0	had to give it one star because there is nothing lower . this printer was the answer to my printing dreams . for about three months , with light home use . only fault at that time is it is loud . it will wake the dead . which is ok , since the dead do n't have to print things that often , this is the perfect printer for them ... other than noise , a faulty `` load paper '' error kept coming up . then , the paper load went bad . it is very unreliable , and ink cartridges run out very quickly and cost about 10 bucks a pop , tonight , i 'm trashing it . buying another printer tonight ! do not waste your money on this piece of trash
1	this compact mini was exactly what we needed to use as a server for our photography studio . all computers can pull from it with no noticible slow down . it was the smoothest install and network to our 6 computers . i will buy another very soon to use as a backup to the first
0	i 've had this scanner for 6 months now . it worked ok the first month , but since then it loves to `` eat '' paper . it scans multiple pages at once . for example , a 20 page document , becomes 15 pages one scanned . i have to scan the same document multiple times ( sometimes up to 12 times ) until the scanner finaly scans each page . it gets to be very frustrating , actually , it 's the worse piece of office equipment i ever purchased . otherwise it works fine
1	i only have a couple of problems with this remote . you have to keep pressing the buttons for dvd , vcr , audio , sat , etc . to change the setting . that sounds like i 'm complaining a lot , and i am . ( sue me . ha ha ) the other is this . i bought this as a replacement for a remote that quit working . i ca n't teach it the functions that i need through the `` learn '' command since the orginal remote quit . which kind of defeats the purpose of having a new remote . i have one of those all in in one home theater units and the remote would n't allow me to set the vcr clock and local channels after a power outage . other than that , i have no problem with it
0	this typewriter is an unbelievable piece of junk . garbage . do n't buy it - even if they offer it to you for free . there 's not enough room here to list the problems - just skip it . do yourself a favor , and stay away from brother . i 've had nothing but problems with their fax machines and printers as well . do n't know how they stay in business
0	i purchased one ( from a local store not amazon.com ) , brought it home and printed a photograph that i had previously printed on a kodak easyshare printer ( my mother-in-law 's ) . the resulting photograp was horrible , it had a very green tint to it . i then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer , the green tint remained . i checked the troubleshooting section of the manual , checked/cleaned the print heads , and still the problem remained . given that the product is still on the market , i suspect i had a broken unit . i did not like the lcd , it is very hard to read . i adjusted the contrast but it did not help . [ ... ]
1	this is a great drive for your money if you use mac , windows , and linux . i use all of them and it works great , i do wish that they had an 8 gig versions out , but this one will do for now
0	i truely wish i had found the prior reviews for this product before i bought it . unfortunately , i am now stuck with a product that will not start and will not run on my pc , running winxp2 ! ! do not buy this product ! ! support sucks all around and there appears to be no fix now or in the near future to get software working ... i lost $ 100 bucks on this one ! !
0	the extendable arm breaks very easily . i had two of them and they both broke within the first month . the company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and i have been waiting over a month for my replacement . very poor product . do not buy
1	the item works perfectly if you do not place it near other mechanical devices , i.e . tv , air purifier , elec . clock , etc . fortunately it has n't alerted us yet so that will remain to be experienced . you have to turn it a number of directions until you get the best reception , then leave it in that position
1	for its price and definately for its length , its an awesome alternative to it 's $ 100 monster counterpart
1	this product works great for my ibook g4 screen and also for cleaning off most smudges on the case , although it seems like i 'm constantly getting new smudges on the screen . do n't expect it to get off the spots that build up on keyboard over time , though . mr. clean magic eraser works well for that ... but only if you make sure to thoroughly squeeze the water out before use on your computer . otherwise it may get in and ruin your keyboard
0	i am disappointed in this product . i was suppose to write to you from the weekend . my two rear speakers just stop working , and also my remote control . i have replace the batteries , but still does not work . i do n't have any other rear speakers to try on the system . pleasy me what to do . thank you epiphane flaviu
0	this cd storage unit isnt the greatest cd rack but if you want something that will do the job and isnt too costly this is the thing for you . it is made from plasti
1	i have had this item for about 6 weeks . have n't used to a lot , but so far i like it . this power inverter is smaller and looks nicer than my old one , which was stolen out of my car along with a few other things . it has one electrical outlet , and above that is a cigarette lighter outlet , so if you have other devices that need that kind outlet you can use them while this power inverter is plugged in . the plug fits kind of loosely in my cigarette lighter outlet , but i do n't know if that 's the plug or the outlet on my car . the only thing i do n't like about this item is the `` no tangle '' cord . its one of those coiled up cords , like a telephone cord ( look at the picture of the item ) . the cord is long enough that it could stretch to the backseat , but if i were to try this it would pull the plug out of the outlet . its coiled so tight that i could n't really put it anywhere that would require the coil to be stretched . it just annoys me that they call it a 36 '' cord . for practical use not more than probably 18 '' , but i do n't have the item right in front of me to measure it . i 'll still give this item 5 stars . 4.5 if amazon allowed 1/2 stars .
1	the tapes are exactly what i had searched the web for . thanks to amaxon.com for listing the seler
1	this memory card works great with my 15 '' powermac laptop . i 've had a noticeable increase in speed with no hitches .
1	it works fine , but it gets really annoying when you 're using it with a widescreen mac and a widescreen tv . the zoom function most plasmas and lcd tvs have is 16:9 aspect ratio , whereas macs are at 16:10 aspect ratio , so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you 're trying to display , or have massive letter-boxing . after three months , i still have n't had any glitches that were this adapter 's fault . if you have hdmi or dvi on your tv or projector , do n't bother with this . go straight to dvi with a mini-dvi to dvi adapter , then get a dvi to dvi cord or a dvi to hdmi cord
1	these headphones sound pretty good , but they are n't the best . when running , the volume controller gets in the way and bounces . it is also easy to change the volume which is annoying . i also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange . i realize it is done intentionally , but it does nothing for me . overall , for just listening at your desk or in your room , these are great headphones . for running , i would recommend something else
1	do you have an old printer you would like to tie to that new lap top ? i did and at first i did n't think it could be done but a little quick research on amazon and i found this beauty . the sabrent cable is very well made and has the look of quality and ruggedness . i just plugged it in and everything took off without a hitch . ( pc w/windows xp
0	this thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and i constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place . the slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the `` hold '' feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off . the little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and i was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod . i finally just gave up on it and returned it . i bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag . i think i 'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options . was this thing even meant for the gen 2 nano
0	consider another receiver before buying delorme 's . delorme 's receiver works only with their software ( the receiver does not conform to any standard , unlike most other receivers . ) the delorme software itself is not very accurate . just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home , i found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly . finally , with the receiver i have , even after the device as been initialized , delorme 's software sometimes is unable to find it . ( i suspect that is because the cable on the gps side sometimes pulls slightly out , but fiddling with it does n't seem to accomplish much ) . real irritating out on the road , as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
0	purchased thinking it was gold-plated as advertised but actually is not . quite noisy - settled for a monster stereo ( male-to-male ) cable instead
1	i bought this device to mount on the wall in front of my work desk , and for that purpose it 's an admirable phone . plus : the contrast- adjustable lcd displays current date and time without you having to set it , the buttons for call list browsing , option setting , etc . are on the back of the receiver so you do n't have to take the phone off the hook to use them . the sound quality is great of course , this being a corded phone , and it feels somewhat worthy in your hand . the keypad lights up , although only for a few seconds - dial fast in the dark ! the ring tone is nice at its medium setting . minus : i find the base a bit bulky , the lcd has no background light , and when the handset is set to `` hi '' volume , you do hear a bit of a screeching noise when putting the set down on the base ( i keep the setting at `` lo '' though , which is plenty loud ) . my main gripe is that the phone does n't have a voicemail indicator , which would be extremely sweet with my phone company ( vonage ) . also , the caller id stuff works with batteries only - at least , they could have put a 6v ac adapter plug on the phone . still , four stars because the phone does all it says it does
0	this unit is not compatible with the sprint ppc 6700 as posted above ! make sure you call pioneer with your telephone model number for compatibility . i tried the ppc 6700 and my wife 's phone ( another sprint phone , not sure on the model number ) . both have issue and pioneer 's customer service agent was horrible and would not help solve this issue , only to blame me for not calling pioneer first ! this unit is the first device that was not compatible with my phone that i ran into
1	the mouse itself is very nicely designed and cool looking . i use it with my apple mac g5 . the optical tracking is great , no moving parts . the scroll wheel is indispensable for browsing the web and scrolling through documents . i just wish the software that comes with it would be more stable , less buggy . i had to uninstall it and use another mouse driver with more options , functions and less bugs
0	the phone was very annoying . everytime i tried to call on the phone , it would not connect . i would have to either change the channel or just not call . i was only able to connect to the number i was calling once in the 30+ times i attempted to call . i returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone . consumers report was very wrong in their rating of this phone . the phone was terrible !
0	this player is junk . it would not play music for more than two hours before going dead . when i called toshiba , the person that i talked to claimed he was n't aware battery life was even a problem . i directed him to read some of the reviews on c-net , which i discovered after i bought it . ( my fault ) it was finally returned and the battery was replaced . now ( after two weeks ) it wo n't even hold a charge . i 'm returning it and will not recommend this to anyone
0	nice basic phone . i 've used it happily for two years , until the battery died . what 's the deal with the batteries on new cordless phones ? my 5.8ghz toshiba wonder died after less than 2 years , while my trusty at from mid-90s keeps on ticking
1	great item , powered off laptop its fans work quietly to keep laptop cool . so you can actually us your lap , without fear of overheating your computer . an inexpensive solution to preventing costly repairs . wish i 'd purchased earlier as i already fried my cd/dvd drive and had to replace them . good product targus
1	the good : we plugged in our new lns2651d on 3/7/7 , about an hour northwest of tampa bay . right out of the box , with an old rabbit ear antenna , we received five hd broadcasts . the picture is amazing in both color and clarity . the bad : we reset the sound coming directly from its speakers , but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen , it lacks sparkle , esp at low to med . volume . the ugly : imagine sending your intelligent , pretty young daughter out on her first date , with shoveled-on make-up , and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress . the `` piano black '' case on this tv is a nightmare ! it shows a rippled effect , which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines ( even lightly ) on it . i 'm hoping after the r department who designed the case , is sent to siberia , they redeem themselves by designing a matte finish slip- cover for this otherwise excellent tv
0	ok so , so i ordered this thing on the 10th and it just arived today ( 19th ) nine days later , of course the last day of there so called `` delivery estimate '' . the package came from walnut california , i live in humbolt county california , i can dive there in 9 hours 9 hours ! and on another note the thing doesnt want to work i plugged it in my wall and my i pod shuts off , ok cool it finaly starts to work and i unplug it freezes for a second then ... shuts off its not somthing i want to trust with my $ 300 i pod dont buy this thing please you think oooo 2 bucks for a wall charger youll be thinking oooo when it frys , electrocuting you instantly putting you in a coma for the next 20 years of your life people you get what you pay for love , joshua
0	this switch works really well . i use it between a windows xp and windows 98 operating systems . when switching to windows 98 , control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly . however , when switching to the xp os , control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds . i also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one usb port on the pc . it frees up a port . using the numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch . it also has buttons on the device itself to select which pc to control . i rate this product 5 stars . when i posted the first time , i thought i put 5 stars ; but i must have accidentally selected 2 . i recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price
1	this bag is very good . the outside phone jack is a plus . the only negative - hard to access the other dvd 's when in use
0	check 10 cases , at least 6 are broken in new box . i do n't want to waist my time to check the remain 15 pieces .
1	with over 3 hours recording time , these are great . i use them for meetings . no problems or errors
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports . in my case , i had plenty of ports , but needed an extension cable , which would help me in plugging the flash drives , whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires ( i keep my cpu , under the table ) .the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough . overall good value for price
0	if you want to talk to some that is soft spoken you better not be using the att5995 or handset590-3 . turn the handset volume up all the way and you will still be looking for more , not even close . i do not have a hearing problem , but this phone had me thinking i did . the speakerphone volume is loud enough but very poor quality .
0	this thing is a piece of junk . it stops working in between of a song for no reason . u can get a better mp3 player if you are spending this much
0	this product only works properly if you have a phone line and are using skype . do not use this product if all you plan to use is skype , it does not react well to this scenario . but , if you are looking for a way to get cheap long distance for your existing phone service this is a great device
0	i have had this kensington fm transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static . unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical , jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages very frustrating . during the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal . i have n't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior . this makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles . if you listen to quiet music , avoid at all costs . if you do n't it is the best transmitter i have tried . sirandar
0	sound quality was fine but this cd changer doesnt work well at all . i am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the cd changer . tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while . it also has problems just changing to the next sequential cd . apparently sony did n't do proper quality testing on this product . i returned mine and after these other reviews wo n't be replacing it with a sony . i hope this is a message to sony .
0	this thing was a nightmare for us . so much in fact that we returned it . it never played the movies correctly and even scratched every movie we played in it . do not waste your money on this thing
1	i needed this cable to use with my garmin rino 120 because my new laptop did n't have a serial adapter . my first try was to use a similiar product from radio shack , but i found the radio shack product was very confusing to use and was unstable . i ordered the cp technologie product from amazon and it worked great ! also , the cp tech product was less than half the cost of the radio shack product ( including shipping )
1	wonderful . holds all my songs , holds my books on tape so i can listen on the road . photos are large and sharp . very easy to use and easy to download . the dials are excelent , on-off and volume work flawlessly . i have many products such as car adapter , speakers , external charger , and external microphone and all work great . i highly recommend the unit . i would never get less then 60 gigs , plenty of space for all of my needs . on my recent trip to california this was the only thing i took for entertainment ; never listened to a song twice
0	i bought these today so that i could review an mp3 presentation . as soon as i put the headphone on i wanted to take them back ! it has the most annoying buzzing sound . what philips means what they say `` noise canceling '' is that the buzzing sound will drown out all background noise ! well i 'm taking these back
0	for those considering the purchase of this unit , keep in mind that only podcasts and videos will be displayed on your tv . menus and playlists will not.the very slight increase in video quality via the use of the s video cable is n't worth it . get some 10.00 cables for your ipod and save mone
0	beware -- this unit does not work with toshiba laptops . tech support is non-existent . you will never get through on the phone . email support is non-existent . you will have to wait weeks to hear back . if it does work with your laptop , this unit does a great job of recording and playing .
0	o.k. , so i 'm paying $ 300 for a set-top box with a 40gb hard drive , but i ca n't use it as a dvr ? why not ? also , the only content i can play on this set-top box is content that comes through itunes ? that 's right . if it is n't in your itunes library , you can play it on the apple tv . this means you caqn play your dvd 's , you cant't play saved dvd , imovie , or other movie files , you ca n't play anything unless it has been successfully ; y added to your itunes library . also , make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen tv . they are n't joking about this . if you do n't have one , you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen ( it wo n't go to the edges and be borderless ) so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box . any pros ? it has to be the easiest setup i have ever experienced with an electronic item . i mean less than 5 minutes and i was set . also , i thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part , it was able to communicate perfectly with itunes just because i plugged the apple tv into my airport extreme router that my computer was also plugged into . basically , apple tv saw this is a direct link . i did n't think it would be that easy without having to configure something , but it was . also the menus are very helpful and attractive . this will be a good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and dvr capability . right now it 's time to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better . if this had only cost me $ 100 or $ 150 i would probably keep it , however . $ 300 is too much for too little
1	i purchased this dehumidifier to tackle my overly-humid house . i live in california , but my house is naturally very humid ( around 75 % on average ) . the humidity frequently gets up to around 80 % and above in the winter as verified with a hygrometer . mold was fast becoming a problem . i have used this dehumidifier for over two weeks now , and it is scary how well it works ! i placed it in the bedroom were the hummidity was at it 's highest , and it lowered my 15'x15 ' room from 75 % to 50 % in less than three hours ! it has a quiet fan that i have no problem sleeping with . the tank is easy to empty and it is light enough to move from room to room . i have not owned any other dehumidifiers before , so i have no basis of comparison , but i am in love with this one ! it was completely worth the price
0	i travel a lot , especially to europe , and hate taking lots of cables with me for the vonage , router , laptop , cellphone and crackberry . the ijuice unit looked like a good idea . however , the unit just failed during my trip , leaving me stranded and badly caught out with no back-up . bad idea a friend switched me on to charging everything via usb . i just bought a cheap $ 5.00 usb charger for the nokia , the crackberry charges via usb anyway , so i just needed to buy an ordinary laptop 110/240v adaptor and i was all set . laptop and nokia phone all charging away at the same time . single point of failure is the laptop . however , apple does a great universal adaptor ( you can get uk./us etc plugs ) with usb for charging ipods for $ 20 , all in one neat unit . you can just stick the usb for the nokia in the back . seriously , do n't waste your money , unless you use more than one laptop or really need a particular tip you ca n't charge via usb . using usb is far lighter , far more reliable , you do n't loose the tips .
1	i picked this up to use on a mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity . it worked great for charging 2 digital camera batteries which would n't fit in the normal outlet at the same time . it 's small , rugged and light so it 's easy to pack
1	i made the mistake to buy the kensington laser pointer before this one . the kensington is a good one , very well made , but it is slightly more expensive and lacks the mouse control . i to not know any cheaper model with mouse function . i can maybe prefer a bit the ergonomy of the kensington , together with the very practical possibility to store the usb receiver inside the unit , but this is probably just my taste and the hiro is quite comfortable either and lighter . my kensington has the embarrassing feature that the laser pointer is interpreted as return on some applications ( exporer on windows and opera on mac os , for instance ) . i do not know it that is a bug or if there is some reason for that . however the hiro does not have this behaviour and that is another reason for which i prefer it . the wheel system of the hiro presenter is very practical . compared with my kensington i found no difference in the quality of the laser : both do their job perfectly . the mouse control is simple and practlical and it will take a very short time to be confident with it . my unit worked perfectly wothout extra software on both mac an pc . overall i am extremely satisfied . on the minus side , the labels on the button on the side are printed with very poor colours . the `` fn '' label diapperared immediately after a few days of usage . a bit disappointing , but , after all , nothing really important . the unit also lacks programmable buttons , but i do not know any presenter with this feature . bottomline . this presenter works well , it is not expensive , and the mouse control is a true must
0	this was ok for the money , decent sound quality , however it died on me after just 2 months of use . the usb drive still works ( sometimes ) but the built in player no longer works . i found the controls less than user friendly and difficult to use
0	the pci bus does not have the bandwidth to get you gigabit speed . you will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a pci gigabit card , even with jumbo frames . your motherboard has two pci busses , and sometimes has three . depending on the chipset and the manufacturer , the internal devices like the keyboard/mouse/floppy , internal network , usb , firewire , and more , will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses . you will have to run sisoft sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the pci bandwidth it can get , but that will not be close to gigabit speed , either . best case on 33 mhz pci is 300 megabit . even if you can find which pci bus has the fewest bandwidth-consuming devices on it , the 33 mhz pci busses in all consumer pcs can not handle the bandwidth of this ( or any ) gigabit card , anyway . if you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built-in gigabit or get a motherboard with 66 mhz pci , pci-x ( not pci express ) , 64-bit pci , or similar , but you 're going to pay lots of money for that . worse yet that built-in gigabit interface might still be on a 33 mhz pci bus and always sharing bandwith , giving you less than 300 megabit speed . it probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework
1	i love this product . unfortunately , i blew mine up in west africa ( my computer was not damaged ) , so when i returned i ordered another right away . i wish that it were a little thinner , but i suppose you ca n't have everything ... .at least right now
1	buying from amazon was cheapest price especially with free shipping . stepped up for more power per channel . stayed in the sony family . ( previous sony surround , output to center speaker quit ) dislike the speaker hook ups in back , difficult to attach speaker wires and screw down connections . overall happy with purchase
0	this was terrible . i returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with apple support desk . the product will probably be better with future software updates , but in my experience , it was fairly unreliable in its current state . examples of problems : would n't download drm managed content online , had problems when downloading itunes purchased music ( the first time i 've had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes ) , could n't connect to my corporate vpn , and finally , just as evidence of the lack of qa on this device , the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the apple extreme . the images were of the previous white , button-shaped device . this was a genuine disappointment , and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad qa . others seem to have had more success , but i 'm back on my 802.11g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared
0	klear screen has to be the absolute worst product i 've ever used . it has nearly ruined my 2001fp . i was stupid and used it on my primary display first , instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that 's far superior to klear screen products . my lcd now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out . my 3 year old laptop 's display looks nearly perfect because i only used the 50/50 solution on it , my 2001fp looks horrible now .
0	this combo cable gateway and wireless router seems like a dream come true . instead , should you fail to heed my warning and purchase this item , you 'll be subjected to a nightmare that will only end when you seek another wireless solution . as a cable gateway the wcg200 performs as expected . setup with my isp ( cox in southern california ) was a breeze . i was up and running in no time . wireless connectivity , however , has been an absolute nightmare . none of my devices ( laptops , bridge , print server ) will stay connected for any length of time . when the router is performing well , i 'm lucky to stay connected for an hour . when the router is performing poorly i can barely stay connected for 15 seconds . the linksys forums are crowded with other users reporting the same problem . i 've been unable to find any official acknowledgement or response from linksys . do yourself a favor and avoid the wcg200 . you will regret purchasing it
1	i purchased this for my wife who wanted a case for her hp pavilion notebook pc ( dv5139us ) , screen size 15.4 '' , ht 1.8 '' , wdth 14.1 '' , depth 10.4 `` . the bag is for personal use , not business , and use will be moderate . she did want some extra compartments for organization . this case has met all her needs , it is light weight , constructed of durable material , well organized . her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease . she is satisfied with this purchase . we would recommend purchasing this case .
1	i already have two of these for my heavy rear bose speakers . the speakers are about are about 10 lbs each and are easily handled . the mounts are solid , and can be oriented in any direction easily . i am about to by three more for my center , and two fronts . i highly recommend
0	it is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them . on the flip side once they have been opened once , they do n't reclose very well
1	this appears to be a good piece of equipment . i hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well .
1	i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play . i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it . it 's the best-feeling keyboard i 've ever owned . the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate , and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature . the backlighting is bright , day or night , and the programmable g-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past . highly recommended
1	this is a great printer for those who want to print on 12x12 scrapbook pages . it works well with heavier ( cardstock ) paper . it also prints great photos . i have a mac i-book . i also use the print shop 2 program with it . it gives me great versatility with my pages photos
1	great soundcard ! i noticed in battlefield 2142 that i can hear the sounds of footsteps behind me better . i 'm not getting knifed as often ( which is a very good thing ! ) i 'm glad i got this card
1	first time i 've ever written a review . i 'm not a high tech type , and sometimes it 's nothing but frustration for me to deal with high tech stuff . this remote was a breeze to program , and works fantastic . my wife and daughter are even less high tech and love it . any problems with use , just press `` help '' and the remote with ask you questions and correct the problem . highly recommended
1	this is an excellent power conditioner and voltage stabilizer , all in one.this unit can protect your sensitive high end audio system , computers , and video moniters , from ... .everyday , power surges , power sags , over voltages , and brown-outs.these surges , pick away at your sensitive equipment..taking years off their useful life ... i own and highly recommend , this unit
1	this is an excellent boom box if you want to be able to take your skyfi out of your car and put it in the house or take it anywhere . it works great
1	i 've owned many sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy walkmen , useful shortwave and portable radios , stylish tvs and high quality cassette recorders . i still have a sony mini component stereo model fh-e656 ( made in japan ) which i bought in 1992 for us $ 400+ ; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out cd player , i decided to purchase this new sony mhcec70 component stereo ( made in china ) . pluses : decent sound good functionality easy set-up and intuitive operation simple remote -- but only covers basic functions cons : very short speaker leads unattractive styling ( for my tastes ) -- resembles a boombox only holds 3 cds vs 5 for comparable panasonic units at first glance , i was disappointed by the cheap construction , skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies . but then i thought : in 2006 for $ 150 , i ca n't expect the same quality as i received in 1992 for $ 400 . everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in china . so , for the money , it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom . the real test will be how long the cd changer works -- to be safe , this time i bought the 2 year replacement warranty . i have n't blasted it at full volume , but it seems to have plenty of power when needed . i originally bought a $ 300 panasonic unit ( sc-pm71sd mp3 sd micro system ) which was returned because it did n't have the full data recording feature as advertised ( data recording was crippled by drm limitations ) . this sony stereo costs half as much , and has almost all the same functionality
0	these speakers are big in size but short on performance . except for the price tag , not much else excites one about them . they make a good surround sound system with the sony 3 speaker set for surround sound , but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub . these speakers lack bass inspite of their size , and sound quality is poor at higher volumes
1	i purchased a sandisc 4 gb sdhc card for my camera . at the time it did not occur to me that neither my sandisc image mate 6 in 1 nor my siig 18-in-1 reader/writer would not be able to read this new version of secure digital . long story short-i called iogear tech support and was assured that this reader would work although netiher their promotional materails nor their packaging indicates that it will . bottom line : it works and it was a very inexpensive ( $ 10 at compusa ) solution to my problem .
1	wow , i 'm surprised by the reviews made here about this product . despite the bad reviews , i bought it anyway . i still believe in a motorola . guess what ? not bad . i bought this phone set and 4 of its satellites to replace my siemens . the siemens was the best phone when it first came out about 5 years ago . this moto phone has the features most people will ever need . the shared phonebook is very valuable . a loud speakerphone on each handset is priceless . incoming and outgoing sound quality is excellent . i do n't understand why there are several reviews here stating the phone has bad sound quality . ok , the range is not as good as my 2.4ghz phone but it is not bad for someone with an average size home . after about 75 meters with 3 walls in between , i can start to hear the voice i 'm speaking to , crackles . i just did this for test but i can get clear voice anywhere in my 4 bedroom house . i am running a 2ghz wi-fi and do not hear any interference . with regard to the phonebook , i wish i can enter more characters each address ! the maximum characters i can enter is only 11 . i think i can enter about 20 on my siemens . another minor quirk is when someone called , i could just lift the phone off its charging base and start talking to the other party . not with this phone . i still have to press the `` flash '' bottom everytime before i can start talking . build quality is excellent . it is a little on the heavy side which i like probably because it uses 4 rechargeable batteries and made of thick plastic . even if i squeeze the handset hard , i did n't hear that plasticky noise and feeling of the plastic warping . i tried the pana , v-tech , uniden , ge , and att in a local store and the motorola is tops . you will not see a rubbery wiggly buttons here . i personally think this is the best phone among the few remaining brands around . if you do not see it that way , it must be a quality defect that can happen on any product .
0	i purchased one of these just shy of three years ago ( feb 2003 ) . i have taken very good care of it ( it stays in a pocket in my briefcase when not in use ) and used it several times a week while i teach . over time , the silver finish wore off around the `` on '' button ( apparently from perspiration from my hand ) , exposing the copper underneath . last week , the button froze in the `` on '' position , so it is now effectively useless . the laser diode still works , however . also , the company offers `` geek points '' for future purchases that are supposed to be good for 36 months . i checked the site earlier this week and , while it 's now only been 35 months , the ones i earned from this purchase are no longer on record
1	being that the tv reception coming out of my vcr is always crappy , the first thing i did after getting my monster cable sv1/100-m a/v cable ( to test is out ) was plug one end it into my cable box 's a/v output jack , then plug the other end into one of my vcr 's a/v input jacks . the result ? the tv reception coming through the vcr was n't crappy anymore ! ! i ended up getting two of these a/v cables to hook up my sony dvd player to my tv via a terk vs-4 switch . the picture is phenomenal ! ! i plan to get two more soon to improve the reception from my vcr my cable box . these a/v cable are worth every penny that you spend on them ! ! you ca n't go wrong with monster cable !
1	i use this when working around the house , in the yard and at the gym . stays in place very well and gives easy access to the control wheel of my ipod . has stood up to more than a year of heavy use and is still doing well for me
1	use original epson brand ink , the heads in the epson printers it 's in the printer itself not in the ink cartridge , it dosent worth saving some dollars and ruing the printer
1	this univeral dvd player comes packed very neatly in an oppo cloth case and is very sleek . the finish of the dvd player is excellent , however the remote is not up to snuff in this department . this player can play pal dvds , it upconverts it to ntsc 1080i . it 's loaded with features that you probably wo n't see on most dvd players out there . the upconversion works well though i 'm not sure the color handling is the best . the audio controls in the setup are awesome . people have complained about the disc tray being flimsy/cheap , but i think it 's just fine . it 's very quick to load and play . you may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you wo n't be able to control most of the features . the hdmi cable that is included with the player is of good quality . probably worth around fifty bucks in the market . price to performance/features you ca n't beat this universal dvd player . buy one and you 'll know
0	sound was n't too bad for price . tinny yes , but cheap . used it a dozen times and then started having trouble getting it to play cds . and then it would n't turn on at all .
1	i purchased this card a month ago . i use it on my dell axim x3i . so far it has been fully compatible , fast , and flawless . i have n't owned another pda or sd card so i ca n't give you a first-hand benchmark . but i can say that accessing the card is quick and i have not had any skips while playing my music files . the 256mb is good for the price if you wait for amazon to drop their price in conjunction with the manufacturer 's rebate
0	pen does n't work as fast as i thought it would have . very slow to upload text to computer . i bought this for a law student and it turns out to be more of a burden to scan and proof the text as you go . if you can type at a decent speed i would strongly discurage purchasing this product for note taking
1	compared to my logitech mouseman dual optical from 2000 , this mouse blows it away by far in accuracy , precision . what i find to be a drawback is the mouse 's light weight and small size . the size comes in handy if i need to flick , but be sure to keep the wire out of the way - as the mouse is so light if you have the wire in a bad spot , it will push the mouse and affect your aim at crucial moments . the `` change sensitivity '' button is in a strange spot ( at least if u have large hands ) located in the center of the mouse where you will need to reach far back and almost touch the pad of your palm of the finger you 're reaching with - not an efficient movement , therefore not applicable in games ( you can assign a sensitivity script to perhaps one of the side mouse buttons if necessary ) . these are only minor itches when compared to the outstanding precision and i would highly recommend it
1	i 'm so technically challenged , and i had no trouble figuring out this system . i already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it . altogether they were a bit pricey , but worth every penny ! very easy to understand the directions , and lots of bells and whistles . lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description . i love the intercom features , they are great for when the kids are upstairs , i do n't have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them . very cool
0	i paid 300+ dollars for a new magellan gps less than a yearand a half ago from boat us and they have already declared it obsolete . if you expect any support do not buy magellan .
0	what more can i say than the above ? it is flimsy , does n't stay in adjustment , rattles around when you move , and looks cheap to boot . do n't waste your money , this thing is junk . it would be more appropriately priced at $ 5.00 .
0	i am on my 2nd unit and both lockup after a short time . neither the remote nor the front buttons will work when it locks up . you have to unplug it and leave it unplugged for at least 5 minutes - maybe longer . it works good when it is working
0	i thought i was getting a terrific deal on 6 ink tanks , they look exactly the same as those that came with the printer and those that are packaged individually . but when i later bought a one-off replacement -- not `` custom '' -- tank i noticed the ink level bar on the printer lcd was not only full but also longer than the other bars ! if the `` custom '' tanks hold only about half the ink , this is n't the bargin it appears
1	ca n't say enough of this machine . i view all dvd 's in hidef now and that is a beautiful thin
0	the dvds i burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality . the only problem is that for every 3 good burns i get one bad one . i 'm using the plextor dvd burner ( love it ! ! ) , but i 'm going to try my luck with a different dvd brand . the failure rate for memorex is unacceptable . it 's less the cost that bothers me , but more the time wasted on burning coasters
1	very good product . you do need to use help menue for instructions because the paperwork that comes with it does n't tell you a lot.overall i 'm having fun using this product
1	this is good for when you go on a trip you know it will keep your streetpilot going . and it is n't bulky . and it 's made with quality just like the streetpilot itself
1	i used this recorder alot , i have alot of classes , and the playback is good , it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you have n't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record . the sound quality is good , 36h record time which can be broken up to folders . the only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume , i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low , and that goes vice versa as well , . nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons
1	opened the enclosure , plugged in my hard drive , connected it to my pc , and it worked . simple as that . i spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that i had to remove a single screw from the back panel when i really had to remove two screws , but that was the only ( very minor ) problem . there is no fan in the case , which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself . i am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink , but i havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself . i am pleased with the enclosure , and would happily recomend it to anyone
1	this has been the best investment i 've made for quite some time . after experiencing the black out after the earthquake that hit hawaii last year and having my computer die , i invested into this unit . i read a few reviews from various sites that said there was issues with it and that often times it came broken . i thought to myself the good reviews outweigh the bad so i 'm going to try it and see . sure enough this unit came with no problems . i plugged it in and let it charge over night . i then added my computer and my monitor to it . i 've seen it kick in while the lights dimmed at my home and i 'm so thankful that it has saved my computer . if anything everyone should invest in one of these for their computers . i fix computers for a living and more often than not people bring in their dead computers due to a power outage or power surge
0	the left palm pad keep peeling , possibly from the uneven heat . this make the protection pad a lot less useful than one would think , which is most people buy this pack fo
1	a great addition to the ih5 radio ! you could do without it , but being able to adjust volume from across my apartment is a great feature
1	i used to buy energizers and duracells at $ 3-4 a pop for four batteries . now i buy generic alkalines at costco . cost : $ 8 for 10 four packs . it 's like having a battery store in the kitchen drawer . according to a recent coprehensive story in consumer reports , there is only a little difference between name brand and generic alkaline batteries
0	one of the most essential buttons on any remote is the channel + button and it did not work straight out of the box . i returned it . beyond that , setting it up takes time but is not difficult . i am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out
0	this is a poorly designed remote . i have six devices connected to my hd television set . the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and , in my case , routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote . i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly . at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv ( which can not turn the tv on and off ) .
0	this product did n't work with my wireless mouse , scanner , and it would mess up my print que and i would have to restart the keyspan software to get it working again . i returned it
1	the edge 305 provides a wealth of knowledge , is easy to install , as well as use . i would love to have given it 5 stars ( it deserves them ) , but one thing that does not work correctly , and really bugs me is the calories expended . it could n't be more inaccurate if they tried to make it that way . the first day that i installed it , i took it for a quick 1 mile test ride . it indicated that in that mile i burned 100+ calories . wish it were true , but it is not . unfortunetly the next day i was going to take it out on a 100 mile ride , but crashed as i started out and have not riden since ( 3 days ) . i wore the chest strap in the office today to test the calories burned further . after 2 hours it read 0 were burned . i just took it for a car ride of 7 miles . in those 7 miles driven in a car , it indicates i burned nearly 600 calories , again i wish , but no way . other than that flaw , whioh i hope they fix with a software update , i highly recommend this product , it all other ways it is great
1	arrived on time and is perfect for using headphones and speakers at the same time .
0	easy setup , but who cares , when the end result is a very slow video . sort of reminded me of jim carey in the movie `` the mask '' . when he whips his head from side to side and you see the `` blur '' , that 's what you see with this webcam ! do n't waste your money . i 'm sending it back tomorrow !
0	i must say that i had to return my atdec wall mount , cuz it 's made in a cut corner way that should be rejected . vesa measurements are 75mm or 100mm , and usually 100mm we would be using . this atdec wall mount has one piece @ 100mm , but the second part is only 75mm , so it has the smaller 75mm screw-ins . on my 2 lcd pc monitors , the monitors had 100mm screw fittings , so i was forced to put the 75mm piece of the mount afixed to the wall . this made the piece on the wall set in w/ small distance between screws . ifelt unsure , and after turning my wall mounted monitor on off a few times . the wall mount 75mm piece started to loosen . do n't buy this mount . peerless is a far better unit to get for yourself
1	after reading all the connection problems with wireless ip cameras , i decided to purchase the wired ver . ( bl-c10a panasonic ) . i was very pleased with the easy setup and dns service included for the camera . i currently use this camera in a cabin , so i can look in and see the temp . inside and look around . this is simpe remote monitoring , as hookup took less than 1.hr to get up and running . i do not use the emailing feature presently . pros : simple to setup and get running over internet price is reasonable images are the best for a camera this cheap using viewnet ( dns service ) very easy cons : wired to the router no included light leds ( but at this price ) must use timer to reset ip camera ( cheap house timer every 24hrs
1	this is a great piece of hardware , the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me . but in my apartment i would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker , it 's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself . the bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default . the other thing is that i would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer . that 's not going to happen with this system , you ca n't change that easily . and yes the 5 disk changer is slow . the maximum volume setting does n't seem that loud to me , but then i have the decibal settings at default . all the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here , it has all the flavors . hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way i 'd like it too , but i only tried rca and not the digital . i have a sony 32 '' wega and i had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the dav-fx100 reciever . that works like a charm , even with 5.1 sound from xbox . one huge complaint i have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best . i see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers , even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my tv . there is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual ! beware ! four stars
1	pros : very inexpensive , can play songs directly from a flash drive instead of an mp3 player cons : ca n't shuffle tracks or make a playlist if you use a flash drive overall i 'm very happy with this device . i live in a big city and had no trouble finding an fm station with little to no interference . i love being able to play tracks directly from a flash drive without having to bring my mp3 player with me in the car all the time . the sound quality is good , but not perfect . similar to playing a cassette instead of a cd . for the low price , i ca n't complain , though
0	i purchased this item and one month later i still have not received any paperwork . i emailed and have not received a reply
0	i just lost my synch adapter and it is on back order everywhere . unfortunately this is necessary to connect to computer and to charge the player . earliest date i can find one is 10/23 due to some shipping problem with creative labs . i 'm at a loss now that the battery is dead . this is the dumbest idea ever . why did n't they design the player so that the cords attached directly to the player ? i agree that you should order a back-up as this thing is so easy to lose and so important
1	i bought these for my zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding , compact headphone for work and working out at the gym . if you are like me and ca n't stand all the earbuds out there , then you need to find another solution . i tried the premium zune buds at 40 bucks , and the bose quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks , but they just gave me earaches and i was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight . i read countless reviews of this headphone and i can say this is the best sounding under $ 40 headphone out there that wo n't mess with your hair . ( yes , better than even the bose earbuds ! ) if you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player , be prepared to be blown away . tight , full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids . you do n't have to crank them either , they sound rich even at lower volumes . but if you do crank them they do n't distort at all . if you have ever tried the bose quiet comforts at the stores , these sound very similar but with an open air design ! the only negative is the comfort . the little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so . i think i 'll get used to it . i 'd much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs. jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal ( which i had ) . that could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems . some other reviewers complained about the headband , but it sounds like they were not wearing these right . once on your noggin , the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head . this keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort . i do not think the headband is too tight , it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place . i might buy a pair of the px 100 's as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading . the px 100 is the same exact phone in an `` over the head '' design . at $ 40 , i can afford to get both
1	portable , easy to use with any chip and really nice pix . i love being able to print from digital files on my ipod
1	i bought this cable half minded reading the other reviews and i was bit worried whether it will work . when i hooked up the cable between my laptop and tv , wow ... . this is really worth a buy .
0	the picture is good and the combo was convenient . however , after 1 year , the dvd broke . now i have just a tv . this is the problem with combos . it is better to get components separately
0	followed the instructions to the letter . pcs would not work once connected and even worse stopped xp starting up - had to go back to restore point . belkin email support is next to useless . i would strongely recommend buying a kvm product from another supplier
0	i liked the md671 for the home office so i thought the md7161 would be a good upgrade for the home phone . not so . the handsets intermittently cut out when the person on the other end is speaking . i tried all the troubleshooting recommendations with no change in the problem . if you can not hear the entire conversation that sort of makes the phone unusable , right
0	5 ml for $ 20 . i would refuse to buy any printer that used this cartridge on principal . die in a fire , hp
0	i bought the c. crane fm transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an fm tuner with headsets as i worked around the house and yard . it broadcast 5 or 6 feet , max , out of the box . i performed the power boosting `` fix '' and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet , if i 'm lucky , before static overpowers the signal . this was a disappointing purchase directly from c. crane that in no way met my expectations . if it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities , build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly . i kept the transmitter because i wanted one for the car . it 's physically well built and works fine for that . i also use it to play my ipod through a radio ... but , understand , the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter . if you want to transmit throughout your house and yard , look elsewhere
1	when i first got a wireless network at home i purchased a kensington wifi finder . it worked fine . but as time went on i saw these smaller versions come out from chrysalis development . i heard they were more powerful and more versatile . so i bought one . i was not disappointed . since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car , it fit perfectly on my keychain . also it has a much longer range than the others . but best of all , it is directional . meaning i can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the leds change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases . what a great product . i love it !
1	there is just one word to describe this product : amazing . i 'm full satisfied with it . just buy it with 1mbytes ( mine is 512kbytes ) . one last thing : the battery lasts forever
1	having a bad view of the southern sky , i needed to get a outdoor antenna for my sirius radio.it maded all the difference . great product and it came with 30 ft. of cable
0	fm transmitters of this size do n't last forever . that is a fact i accept but i had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks . i bought my first one from target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player . the sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to oregon it was extremely noisy . i plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver ( direct line of sight ) no more than 40 feet away . two more days and it crackled its last and died . i exchanged the transmitter at target for a new one and a week and a half later i was returning that one as well . spend a few extra bucks , save yourself the hassle and get a belkin .
1	muy pero muy bueno , es mejor todavia que el primer dvd que salio de esta gira
1	radio shack wanted $ 39.95 for a similar item so at $ 9.95 this was a steal - swr is good and performance is as much as i need for corvette runs although it hears well and gives a good transmit signal for the small size far beyond what i need . i did have to put a metal plate on the vette ( discreetly ) as it would n't stick to the fiberglass . good produc
1	every house should have a grundig s350 deluxe . big , brawny , `` grabbing '' in all the hard-to-get stations with ease , championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business , the grundig s350 deluxe version , is a bigger , better version of the old grundig s350 , eliminating some of the `` drift '' problems of the earlier model . the speaker on the deluxe is bigger and brighter . whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin , the grundig s350 dl has depth . is it a perfect radio ? no . you do n't have presets in spite of the digital read-out . you get a little am overload . here in los angeles i get overload on 1150 so that i 'm listening to two shows at once . also the cheaper ( and cheaper built ) ge superradio boasts an internal am ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better am . if you 're looking for a radio with similar features as the grundig s350 dl but erases its weakness -- no presets and am overload , then you might want to check out the grundig g4000a . it 's the same price as the s350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio . or you might look at the stunning kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the eton e5 . but even if you get a fancy preset radio , every house should have the big easy-to-use grundig s350 deluxe . update : comparing the s350 to the same-priced g4000 for several months , it becomes clear that the g4000 is a better buy : superior am , superior separation of am stations , presets , same warm speaker , and smaller .
0	when we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the cisco label . when we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and no tech support ! if you read the boards on the linksys site you 'll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different isp 's and areas of the us since this item has been released . please do n't waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage , you 'll end up sucking down 2 bottles of ibuprofen and a 12 pack of your choice before the night is even through
0	i purchased this boombox over a year and a half ago . what i do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and mp3 playback . i agree that it could have been better . it would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last . you can not rewind/fast forward in the song in mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd . sometimes i like to hear a certain portion of a song again , but i will have to play the entire song again . i no longer have the remote and there are some things that i can not do anymore .
1	i bought this to clean up all of my kids dvds . they have a ton of discs that are dirty , scratched , etc . i have cleaned over 30 discs so far and have fixed all but one ( it was *really* scratched up ) . i am suprised at the negative reviews on this item since i have considered this one of my smartest buys this year
1	they are great for putting dvd 's , cd 's in . they arrive in great condition
1	im not a professional keyboard player . i bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and guitar pro . it suits those needs great . its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing . the keyboard itself is extremly small reminds me of a kids toy keyboard . if your looking for something more professional you will probably have to fork out the $ 100 bucks and get the bigger model .
0	before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12-in-1 : lexar and sandisk . i decided to buy lexar . i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick . i have 2 cards : 128 mb and 1 gb . i had no problem with 128 mb card . but i could not insert my gig card into this reader . it just did not go . i tried hard trying not to break the card - no success . it was a surprise for me . may be because my card was made not by lexar - by sandisk ... ? i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem . any way i had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 sandisk reader .
1	the silicone is great quality , fits the nano snugly , and the arm band is nice . wonderful product , does what it 's supposed to do , for a fabulous price . recommended
0	i have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired . the customer services rep told me that it will be $ 110 for a repair which i can almost buy a new one if i pay the shipping on top of that $ 110 . i have other eight ( 8 ) lcd monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality . i 'll newver buy any proview products ever . i will give zero star if there is one
0	as soon as i received this radio i tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up . the base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio . i am looking to return this item as it is not designed right . i can not comment on the reception as the antenna is broken ! overall , it 's a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials .
1	i got my replacement battery and put into the computer . the date started working whenever the computer is off and i have n't had any problems
1	a fast card which works as expected . you do n't know the difference a fast card can make , unless you swap to a slower one . even a slower camera/device will have improved performance with a faster card such as this one . enjoy
1	the price i paid for this spindle of cd-r 's was pretty good and have not had a problem yet . the only price that i have seen that beats this one was staples running a sale of 50 for $ 10 , but i have yet to use the stock that i bought as i still have about 25 left on the spindle . if you do n't want to wait for their sale , this is an excellent bargain . the print surface has done very well with the inks from my epson photo r-220
1	i 've had a number of universal remotes over the years and each has had pluses and minuses to offer . the monster remote is a very effective universal remote on all accounts but there is one thing that stands out here above all the other remotes . wireless control over lighting . i replaced my dimmers and switches with the monster dimmers and switches and now i can control every light in my house . monster really does n't talk much about this feature but being able to hit `` all off '' at night on my way to bed and have the remote turn off all the house lights is killer . you can even map ligthing scenes to activities . if you hit watch a movie it can turn down the ligths at the same time . really cool . good job monster .
1	wow ! i did n't trust the other review . i needed a mini amp , so i decided to bought this one , because of the price and of the dual purpose . right out of the box , it actually smell bacon ! ! amazing , it was true ! and not only that . if someone is trying to kick you out of your house because of the noise of your beloved amp , and do n't want to stop , this is the mini amp for you . ca n't believe the speaker in it . and , about the disto , well , is ok for practice . wo n't regret about it .
0	i had this card for more than 6 months , and it worked super in my canon powershot a510 . transfers went well too . then all of a sudden for no reason i kept getting `` card error '' on my computer and digital camera a week ago . my sd/usb converter could n't find the card either . i had really good photos i wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good . what a joke
0	purchased this tv december 10 after much research . unfortunately for me the tv was defective on arrival ! when it is working it is a very nice tv , but the customer support from both olevia and target leave a lot to be desired . target will not replace the item ... the corporate policy i am told is the item must be returned via shipping ... you are responsible for packing the item and putting it outside for the shipping company to pick up ... and once target receives the tv back and it is processed thru receiving a credit will be issued ... they say within 30 days ... my credit card company ae says it will take 6 - 12 weeks ... all this time with no tv , paying interest on the credit card or paying the balance and not be able to purchase another one until everything clears ... i do n't know about you but that is pretty steep ! now olevia ... though it is under warranty i again must pack up the tv in the original box , ship it back to olevia and when they receive it back they will ship another one to me ... the tv weighs 100lbs packing it up is not easy and again i am without tv for a month or more while the transaction takes place . if i want a tv at the time the defective one is shipped i must give olevia a $ 1600 credit card hold while they process the transaction . either way the consumer gets screwed ! ! the television has a one year warranty , i purchased the extended warranty ... what else could i have done ! ? ! i am told by both target and olevia this policy falls under the `` other terms and conditions '' ... i wonder why they do n't actually say that ? buyer beware of target and olevia ! ! !

0	wouldnt buy from this bunch again . the product was given as a gift . my son took it home first week of january when their christmas visit was over . couldnt get the scribing process to work . was told to contact the manufacturers to fix the problem which he did and they couldnt fix . then he tried to return via amazons instructions and after hassling with that was told only the original purchaser could return it and so he asks me to see about it . i am told when i contact antonline that its been to long ( january 22nd ) to return the merchandise . most responsible companies extended their return deadlines for christmas and some dont even have one . wont do business with manufacturer or antonline again . having problems with other amazon merchant returns too and may stop using amazon all together except that i use their credit card alot . guess that can be changed too
0	long periods of garbled static mixed with random brief moments of actual fm reception . this is in town trying to receive a major station . i am packaging this up and its going back today . this is my second try with sony that has miserably failed . guess maybe i should be looking at another mfg
1	i have used these seagate drives for almost 2 years now . they work nicely for editing movies , and i like the combo firewire and usb2.0 interface . i trust these cheaper seagate than the expensive lacie ( we bought a box full of lacie d2 , they all fail in 6 months ) or store brand drives . hard drives are prone to failure . but seagate has served my company well . using : seagate 750gb , 500gb , 400gb . daisy chained ... .
1	i just made a long trip from miami , florida , all the way to s. carolina , with a explorist xl loaded with directroute v3 , everything worked just fine , i installed the software , unlock it , upload the maps , all with out any problems , the unit was very fast and accuracy did n't need to keep it over the dashboard , from inside the vehicle worked very well , never took more than a minute to track all satellites , the street route where very accurate , never got lost , working with poi 's was very simple , did n't have any problem handling very large maps i really recommend this unit
0	this makes no sense . if the industry standard is 4x6 , why did they , kodak , cut the paper to 4x6.5 and then advertise on the carton that it is 4x6 -- yes , i see the fine print on the back side of the carton that reads `` actual paper size is 4x6.5 '' i still do n't understand why they did this . now i have cut the pictures down to the correct size ... what a waste of my time ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	a couple years ago i got a projector for the `` big screen effect '' , and decided to finally get my mini advents out of storage for the surround sound . my old pioneer receiver worked ok , but i decided it was time to upgrade . i have 30 year old speaker lab ( build 'em yourself ) speakers up front with the advents in back . the only complaint i have with this unit is there is no way to connect a turn table ( yes , i 'm old ) . so i kept the pioneer for dedicated service to the record player . i have my son hook everything up as he is taking networking in school . for him it 's a breeze . i do n't even look at the directions . i just say `` here '' . having said that ; i think this thing is great ! if you are my age and can go back 30 years to your first sound system , you paid a lot more to get a simple 200 watt system ( wow ) for your records and cassettes . ahh ... . technology . i love this thing ! i can understand that some folks want something better , but for 95 % of us , this will be the last one you will ever need . highly recommended . 4 stars for the lack of lp connection . otherwise ... . 5 all the way
0	what were they thinking ? or are they thinking at all ? sonic stage is a piece of crap . it freezes , hangs and very very user friendly ? ? ? ? since you need their software to load the music , i would stay away from this player as far away as possible . pros : nice sound quality . cons : everything else . my recommendation is go for creative usb players . it 's very good quality and better battary life . with creative players , you just drag and drop files and you done with it . i see why sony is failing in mp3 players market
0	when i first got this camera , i was satisfied . it is complicated to use ( definitely not intuitive ) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want . however , it took pretty good pictures . however , soon after the warranty expired , it began to overexpose pictures and we could n't stop it from doing that . we tried to contact fuji but have gotten no response . my wife found that this is a common problem ( overeposure and lack of response from fuji ) , which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell . hopefully , they have fixed the problem but i would n't bet my money on it . this camera has given us more frustration than it is worth
0	i had a 1gb titanium sandisk cruzer at work fail . i tried several times to contact sandisk , including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response . my wife 's cruzer just failed as well ( the power light comes on , it is recognized by xp , and the light goes out , the system ca n't id the device , so it 's useless . it does the same thing on all of the xp systems in our house ) . i 've tried front side usb connections , rear connections and hub connections . no dice . i 'll never buy another sandisk cruzer . and i was going to order another 100 for the office . their loss
0	why pay $ 46.75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer ( impact ) for only $ 19.95 at b photo and video . i have both the the dl-150 pentax battery that came with the camera and the impact imdl150 . i ca n't tell any difference between them other than the price . camera makers make a hugh profit on propritory items that can be obtained elsewhere at much lower prices .
0	these are by far the worst headphones i have ever bought . i did not know they could make headphones whith such horrible sound quality . they also feel like they are made of cheap plastic . definently not worth the $ 15 i paided for them
1	this is absolutely the best mp3 i have ever owned . what makes it the best ? 1 . 16 million color 2.5 lcd touchscreen . 2 . battery life is too good to be true . 52 hours audio 10hr video . 3 . the best sound , it has how much tweaks , its sick . you can slowdown a song or make it sound like the chipmunks . has bbe , wide stereo , enhancement stereo etc . 4 . the volume is sooo dam loud . i had a zune and the volume level was at 20 , the lourdest it could go . the d2 level is 50 and at 30 it sounds as high as the zune . 5 . you can encode avi video bitrate at 1.5mbps.also have wmv which you can encode at 768kbps . 6 . no need to install to transfer files , it works like a usb flash drive . 7 . you can change backgrounds and if you put a black background and your text is black , you can change the text color to 20 difference colors or make you own . 8 . the touchscreen is smooth and flawless . when playing music it tells you the info of the file . example bitrate info , hz etc . something that is lacking on the big boys . 9 . has tv output , also has a recorder to record conversations . 10 . can view .txt files . 11 . can view pics at very high pixels . 12 . fm tuner , you can record from the fm radio . you can set the bitrate from low to 256kbps . 13 . has a sd slot for more storage . get a 8 gig sd for a total for 12 gig . imagine in 2 years when they have 20 gig sd . 14 . great support , firmware updates are always available . plus sooo much more
0	i dont like this mouse , i brought , and never work , its useles
0	i 've owned three of interlink 's units , but that was before competitors came to market with well-designed units . the interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily ; there is no off switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one 's pocket ; the advance and go-back buttons function most of the time , but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2-3 times per 30 minute presentation . although i agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this interlink product better than i do , it seems these other reviewers have not compared the interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features . for example , the kensington pointer is half the price ; the case is sturdy , has a no-slip outer coating , has a comfortable feel in the hand , and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use . placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip . and the advance and go-back buttons function all of the time , not just most of the time !
0	i purchased this because i have to do a lot of math online and was hoping i could use this for that purpose . also i was hoping to be able to use it for taking notes . so far , i 'm not impressed . the pen is a crummy little plastic thing and not very satisfying to use . it is actually very uncomfortable -- particularly when you consider you have to press very hard to get your entire note set to be recorded . talk about writer 's cramp ! i 'm also disappointed that you ca n't write on it and have it instantly displayed to the computer interactively . my fault for not understanding the functionality better but i thought this could double as a writing tablet . i ca n't speak to the size of the paper since i have n't tried any other size . in general , a big disappointment and 90 dollars that i would have been better off just setting on fire ! another item destined for craigslist . p.s . -- to the reviewer who was wanting handwriting recognition -- my pad did come with a trial version of a package that would convert to text . of course , that was of very limited use since the stooopid thing failed to capture my handwriting accurately in the first place . but the capability is there..
1	what else do you need to know ? you plug in your pcs and a cable to your router - and go . i used a netgear hub for years . replaced it with this linksys switch and my network speed improved immediately
1	i 've owned this item for almost a full year and i am extremely pleased with it . it 's so nice being able to carry around my laptop and my books in the same bag . the side pockets are kind of useless for them being so small , but i guess i 'll be able to find a purpose for them .
1	i bought this mount for a philips 42 '' plasma tv . the tv weighs probably about 100lbs . i thought the price for it was ok , but i do n't know how much an average mount would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other mounts . the mount was put on our living room wall by a `` handy man '' because i did n't have a stud finder . he was able to to put the mount on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic . the mount sits very well secured and the frame of the mount is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured . the 5o tilt function is very nice to have and is being used so the tv sits a little high , but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house . the room for the input cables is a little small , and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but have n't noticed any degradation in the signal . none of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way , so its not of a concern . i took the cables and made a 1 '' `` trunk '' of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories . the tv sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o tilt . i rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong . it also looks nice and stays well hidden . its features with the 5o tilt work great and the locking bar makes removing the tv easy ( i had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables ) . i am very very happy with it and would definitely recommend this product
0	bought my go510 on november 14 as a christmas present for the wife . it comes with only 90 days of warranty . today is april 6 and the thing is broken . for a few days it had trouble finding the satellites , then just went dead . it was never abused , never left the car . out of warranty for just 45 days , $ 600 wasted . it is junk ! stay away from it
1	jensen jm10 anonymous review i love these headphones ! ! the easy access volume control is right where i need it and i can turn it on and off whenever i need to . they are a great value ! the headphones stay where they are supposed to and fit my head great . the sound quality is clear and crisp . the single cord attached makes it feel as if your not wearing headphones at all . i would recommend it to all my friends
1	for the price , i doubt you could do better . true , there are higer-end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance , but if all you 're after is a significant improvement in the quality of every channel and dvd you watch , you ca n't beat the ads for it 's price . the biggest flaw is the device 's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds , where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my philips plasma set to black-out for moments . this aside , i 'm very happy with the ads , especially it 's under $ 300 price . one day maybe i 'll upgrade to a unit by dvdo , but not until they come don to the sub- $ 500 range
0	warning : this unit has flaws that can render it useless . my intention was to share my dvi monitor with my usb keyboard and mouse between my pc and mac . simple enough , this unit fit the bill according to the specs . however , as soon as i hooked everything up per the directions , the unit started beeping like crazy and would not stop . i had to disconnect all the cabling to get it to stop as everyone in my office ran to my desk to see what the noise was all about . alright , 20-minutes googling for support lead me to the conclusion that i needed to perform firmware upgrade . warning : do n't do it ! attempting a firmware upgrade on this unit from xp will most certainly render it a paperweight . there is no fixing the unit after the firmware upgrade fails , and it will under xp . when i tried the update i the utility reported `` tramsit error . '' note the spelling on the word `` transmit '' - that is how belkin spells it in the utility . if they can not spell correctly in a vital utility such as a firmware upgrader , what chance is there the code is quality ? anyway , that was the kiss of death . the unit was dead and had to be sent back for rma . unacceptable ! i would not recommend this product to anyone . it is the worst.kvm.ever
1	great picture , great price , superb fast delivery by amazon ( via egl trucking ) . no complaints except for a faint buzzing sound on the plasma tv . i have heard that all plasma 's `` buzz '' a bit . this would not stop me from purchasing this tv again
1	if you zoom in on the picture , you 'll notice that it 's actually 16 gauge wire . i received it and can confirm that it 's 16 gauge . wire works fine , although the spool that 's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing . it 's not a big deal though , and my only disappointment was on my end when i realized 100 ' was n't enough to hook up my 7 speakers
0	the thing would n't even fit around my handle bar ; i had to zip-tie it on . a waste of $ $ .
1	i bought the telezapper from john whitaker and it was delivered in 3ays . it did n't work so i contacted john and he told me to return it and he would test and if it did n't work he would send me a new one . he was good to his word and promptly send sent one that worked . he 's the best : ) ben . rodrigue
0	i received my mp3 player with a big black spot in the middle of the screen , i sent it back and it has been 2-3 months i havent heard anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit
1	this is a great radio for sailboats and other boats that do not have a 12v power supply
0	fyi : this does not fit the new generation 5.5 of ipods ( 80 gb ) . another thing is that there is n't a hole for the headphone jack which is rather odd
0	when i got this product out of the box ( i had n't seen one in a store before ) , i was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared , particularly at the price they charged ( about $ 80 at the time ) . the box i received was also missing the insert for the ipod nano , and the nano wo n't sit securely in the ipod socket without it . i returned this product , and for about the same price , i got a much more solid -- and better sounding -- boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano ( though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your ipod songs ) . this would n't be a bad ipod speaker set if you could get it for $ 20 , but at $ 80 it 's dramatically overpriced
1	this product is a must have for your shure earphones . once you use this with the earphones you will not want to use the headphones without , it just takes a little getting used to
1	i bought this for my daughters sansa e230 mp3 player and could not be more satisfied . i was leary of the price , but this unit is worth every penny . recharges your player and has awesome sound for the size , while plugged in or with batteries . no regrets about this purchase
1	this card is significantly cheaper ( at the time i ordered ) than the sandisk extreme iii at the same speed ( 133x ) . i was expecting to receive a 100x since it was listed as that in the description but the 133x came and i was very happy . works as advertised and kingston is a reliable memory brand . product came quickly
0	what company would make a router that you can set up wired and then take it wireless and it wo n't work . incredible . my experience mirrored exactly that of many who have already written . it just should n't be this way . when i finally did get it working , after tweaking some settings , and spending all freaking day on the linksys forum it had virtually no signal in a very modest house . i do have to say the their forum is top rate . the people were very helpful and very friendly and a great place to turn if you do n't want to go through scripted support suppliers . product wise a very disappointing experience . people wise very good but long gone are the days that you put up with an inferior product because the people are so good
0	i am glad i purchased my cardscan 700 , but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions can not be done at all . my impression is that this is the best product on the market , due to its scanning properties , which are quite good . there are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed , and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless , since the output can not be transferred to a useful place . pros : it does a pretty good job of scanning . the algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive . even cards that catch and rotate as they go through , producing a funny smeared image , have some of their contents scanned correctly . the superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product . there is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards . operationally the product is especially nice- i can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one , glancing at the screen to catch errors . the card image is retained in the record in the cardscan database , which is important . cons : 1 ) the exit path has places that cards can hang up , and they can catch as they go through . this happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat , so part of the operation is to try to prevent that , by straightening out bent corners ahead of time , and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck . quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous , this would n't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case . 2 ) although the product retains the image of the business card , there 's no way to pass that through to outlook or export it to any other format . this is very unfortunate . i could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one , except that cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image . why not ? it 's easy to implement . 3 ) every time i start the program it harasses me about registering , even though i 've been specific that i do not wish to . it also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though i 've asked it not to do that . it therefore ignores the user wishes . 4 ) the data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file , in a simple text or csv format . there is no way to create an outlook format .pst file , which would simplify importing , and allow for the future option of including an image . outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record , but apparently cardscan folks are n't even close to thinking about this . 5 ) if i indicate that a data export for a file is destined for outlook , the field names are not set up correctly , so unless i do some heavy editing of field names , nothing much other than the contact name gets across . if i export directly to the running outlook program , it is n't perfect , but it 's close enough to be usable . why did cardscan get one right and not the other ? ? in neither case can i send the card image over . 6 ) i was forced to install microsoft .net software even though i intended to do all my exports via files . i did n't get a choice- if i did n't install .net , the installer stopped and exited without installing any cardscan software .
0	overall the recorder worked ok. a moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded dvds could not be finalized for unexplained reasons . however , that is irrelevant now . a few weeks ago , the unit stop working . i does not turn on at all . what a waist ! it is out of warranty now
1	i bought this printer to print my shipping labels faster . it 's easy to use ! it prints very fast.print quality is excellent . changing diferent type of labels is easy too . i highly recommend this printer
0	memorex changed the cases in this package , yet failed to reflect this on the packaging . i purchased them at a local office depot . it 's the one with the patented hub that 's supposed to protect your dvds center . anyway , the two packages i got are no difference in comparison to regular cases i 've gotten with sets i 've bought . i felt ripped off and will be returning these to the store for a refund
1	as headphones they work fine but the microphone falls off repeatedly and this appears to be the result of a bad design . after the 10th time the microphone failed entirely and refuses to work . i 've isolated the problem to the microphone itself . as headphones they are fine but in you need a microphone you should look elsewhere .
0	i 've been a big fan of ms keyboards and mice for years now , and the desktop 7000 is the first huge disappointment . i do love the design and the feel of the keys , but the keyboard is constantly issuing commands from the 'touch sensitive ' areas when i do n't even touch them ( i type 120+ wpm ) . in addition , the middle mouse button only fires 50 % of the time , and the delay in the bluetooth is problematic for anyone who needs precision . on top of that i began having usb stability problems when i started using their usb bluetooth connector . this is with vista x64 . i 've already returned one unit and am having the same problems with another , and will be returning it for a full refund . rumor has it ms is issuing a recall on certain units of this particular keyboard . oh , and there 's a bug with the intellitype software that renders the pause/play button for media useless in vista ... guess it 's time to look for something else :
0	i 've bought one of the 12c platinum because i needed a calculator in my office . i do n't do financial calculations , so probably i 'll use the calculator only to make elemental arithmetics , but i like rpn and the programmable features . build quality is below expected : intro key responsiveness is different than other keys ' , the soft case finnish is bad and the support pieces are not well adjusted , so the calculator is slightly unstable . with the tag price this machine has you expect to get a perfectly assembled piece . disappointed
1	if only other computer products were this easy to set up and use - highly recommend this product
1	i 'm not a serious piano player , just casual . do n't have room for a piano , so this serves my purposes . i just want to entertain myself . if i were a professional who played in public , not sure if this would be the ultimate keyboard , because it does n't have a fullsize keyboard . but for practicing and casual playing it 's great ! it has more features than i will ever use
0	this item worked for a while , but required fiddling ( unplugging and replugging repeatedly ) with the lighter socket each time i restarted my car . eventually , however , it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets . do n't waste your money on this piece of crap
0	i can not speak for all devices , but this was a total failure in my case . i am a fast typist , and it seemed that about 20 % of the keystrokes were not picked up by my treo 270 . this was simply unacceptable , so i immediately returned it . i can not determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard , the software , or my old pda . newer , faster pdas might have a better success rate , but the potential for problems will still be there . my suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your pda
1	i have my ipod hooked up to the stereo on my motorcycle . the ipod stays tucked away in a safe place , and the remote gets strapped to the handlebar . all the needed functions are now at my fingertips . i can lock the ipod control pad , so it does n't accidentally get bumped . i also use the griffin fm transmitter . nice , but not nearly as slick as the remote . i ca n't use them both at the same time , but i do n't need to
1	i have been putting this television through its paces since i got it a few weeks ago , and it is by far the best tv i have ever owned , and very difficult to beat . the image quality is really good , with bright , vivid colors and wonderful detail , especially for 1080i/p content , but even lower-resolution 720p content , which is what 's more commonly-available on ota hd broadcast , looks phenomenal . i also have an apple tv hooked up to it , and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p , 480p , or 720p , it still looks quite good . it does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection , and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost , and the dnie processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse . however , it 's very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have . like all lcds it does have some slight black point problems ; these are n't noticeable for fullscreen 16:9 content , but for older 4:3 content it 's pretty obvious that the black is n't pure black . however , this is again tunable . the only thing i really notice which is pretty annoying is that it does n't do a very good job of upscaling 480i content , such as the output from most video game systems , and for dvds to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive-scan player there is a lot of visible pixelation when the 480p content is scaled up . it 's really more a sad reflection on how the previous `` next-generation '' video looks downright primitive by today 's standards . the other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners , it does n't have an on-screen program guide . my previous tv ( also a samsung ) had an on-screen program guide , but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on , and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the epg information anyway , so it 's not really that big of a deal . you can still see the detailed information for the program that 's currently showing , so it makes use of epg , just not as much as it could . this television 's tuner is also quite phenomenal . my previous tv required a very carefully-positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation , while with this one i only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and i get perfect reception of every local digital station . another nice improvement over samsung 's older hdtvs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that tv stations do ( for example , pillboxing a letterboxed 16:9 show , which is very common for widescreen non-hd programming ) . also , analog tv stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital , so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo ( while previous samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material ) . as a pc monitor this is also quite nice . i have a mac mini hooked up via svga cable , and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal-clear , and of course you can hook it up via hdmi ( with a dvi to hdmi adaptor ) as well . the only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint - at least on analog svga the only 16:9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080 , which can be difficult for some older systems to handle . however , on hdmi it should support all the standard hd resolutions . this television may be more expensive than others in its size class , but it also far outshines every other tv i have seen , aside from the newer ln-t4065 , which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio . if you want to only buy one tv which will last for a long time , it would be hard to go wrong with this one
1	easy to mount on the wall . though this item came with hardware with different sizes , i still had to buy some hardware with different length than what they supplied . this mount perfectly suited for my 46 '' sony lcd flat panel . in about 30 min , i could mount tv on this bracket .
0	this printer is a piece of junk . the print mechanism is constructed of flimsy plastic so that unless care is taken in inserting the print cartridges , the mechanism is likrly to be damaged . like other hp printers operating under xp , it is almost impossible to cancel a pring job in case of a problem ( e.g . paper jam , paper out ) . cancelling a print job results in a `` deleting document message '' which remains until printer is disconnected ( you can turn it off under these circumstances ) and computer is rebooted . often xp hangs up and the computer must be poered off withexiting windows properly which results in a long diskcheck on repowering . i have long had this problem with an older hp model , but had hoped they had corrected this problem in their software by now , but alas ... . the crown of it all is the life of the ink cartridge . the tricolor cartridge , costing about $ 18 at wal-mart , lasts for about 12 8 x 10 photos before the ink low warning comes up . in sumarry : do n't buy this printer whatever the price . it would probably be wise to avoid hp inexpensive printers altogether .
0	mouse movement is extremely slow . it literally takes 10 ( ! ) seconds to get from one side of the screen to another ( 800x600 ) . i just got it from officedepot [ ... ] . buttons are too small and hard to control . joystick is unresponsive
0	i , too , experienced the `` blue screen of death '' on my laptop which has xp pro on it . i had to uninstall the card software in order to stop my system from continuously rebooting . on another note , the install of the router was great , regardless . i did n't get anywhere with the tech support group and had to return everything . anthon
1	i purchased this for my teenager to use with her ipod nano . i shopped around for a while before i finally decided on this one because it came with losts of accesories and she uses it everyday all the time and says it works perfectly . i 've only had it for a month but it 's holding up in the hands to a teen and no complaints so far .
0	do not buy this system . for the money there are much better systems out there . i bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers . the main problem with the system ( which bose has corrected by the way ) is that the `` acoustimass '' component ( bose 's fancy name for a subwoofer ) is not active ( or powered ) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges . the result is that you get a very `` tinny '' sound out of most applications including dvd 's . i ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better . in hindsight i would have bought a different brand than bose , but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely , and the size of the cubes is nice . still pissed that i spent that much money on a substandard system , but hey , got sucked into the bose marketing machine
0	notice , all the happy ... .five star ratings , are from people that just bought this mp3 . i have had mine for 9 months . i have had this mp3 since christmas 2005 . i bought the white 512 for my son at the same time . whith in 3 weeks , my son 's was no longer working at all , he had it in his back pack , and some how it got crunched enough to never work again ! ! i was not happy . also in a few months , mine started to have issues . the very `` tiny '' menu button is rediculous . and the main toggle was a complete failure for sony . i accually removed the cover to the toggle , and just moved the joy stick under it , to change songs , or volume . how stupid . i am so mad about this mp3 player . i am going to buy a creative v. i have done a lot of research this time , and i will not buy another sony . the hold button , that is part of this sliding door never works , i find the player dead in my gym bag , all the time ! ! ! apparently , the door slides over a bit , and the player will turn on , for hours , and than you have a dead player . maybe sony should have given us a on/off button , than this would not happen ! dont do it folks , look into other options , even my mom 's ipod nano is better designed than this joke of an mp3 player .

1	bueno esta quemadora dvd muy buena recomendable , para los usuarios que quieran vivir una experiencia unica , es la mejor que ha existido , gracias amazon por vender productos de vanguardi
0	creating a dvd , using imovie to idvd even on a powermac g5 quad ( superfast , supergreat ! ) is a 4-5 hour process . a 10-15 % failure rate , due to poor media quality is unacceptable ! the 'quality control ' at memorex sucks ! it is not so much the cost of the bad dvds , but , there are superficial scratches on the recording surface of 5-8 out of every 50 i have used , causing a failure to burn , after a very lengthy set up process . i will be using verbatim blank media . .from now on !
1	i bought a 1gb with my new camera because i was giving my other camera and it 's 256 memory card to my sister . the smaller card would fill quickly and i 'd have to develope the pictures or deleat them . i paid about $ 9.00 more for my card in sept. , and thought that was a deal . now , you can get this card for $ 20.00 . that 's a steal for a 1 gb . also , i like the little case provided to keep the card safe when i take it to the store to develope the pictures . love it
0	beware of kingston rebates ! of course , i hope your experience would differ , if you were to buy kingston product ( s ) , but mine was terrible . i bought a kingston compactflash card that offered a $ 50 mail-in rebate . i promptly ( as in , the day after i received the item delivery ) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and upc code and sales receipt ; then sent it all on its merry way . yes , i was well within the rebate period , both for the purchase and for the postmark date . my purchase was a valid retailer ( think huge online e-tailer ) . the rebate required sending the entire original upc label , which was like the entire outside package for my cf card , about the size of 1 ½ business cards when flattened . no problem . about two months later , i get a letter saying `` your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate original upc code as required by the rebate offer . '' well , now what ? i ca n't re-send the original ( it was already in their possession ) . i called , and they insisted on repeating what the letter said . i re-sent my photocopies and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase . after another 6 weeks of pursuing this , i figured this is their scam . they simply would n't honor the rebate . and without the original upc in my possession , i could n't really submit to their requirements . if you 're looking for a ram upgrade , i 'd suggest you look at a quality company like ocz ( the best ! ) , or patriot , geil , or corsair . if you 're looking for a value flash memory card , i might suggest sandisk . for one , kingston does not make the best products , they are value-driven products . two , there are competitors to kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices . three , kingston will not stand behind their customer as i have experienced . i urge you to , please , be cautious of kingston and their rebate scams
1	good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device . my major fear was that this would make my 1955 too thick and i would not use it . it is just right and great protection for my 1955 - by the way i replaced a 4150 with this 1955 and case because my daughter accidently sat on my 4150 and broke the screen . it is a great piece of protection
1	this was my first gps system of any kind . i was n't sure what to expect . i have a small mazda miata so i wanted a small-screen gps that did not overwhelm my small dashboard and this did not disappoint . i was afraid that the screen would be too small , but it 's perfect . i do n't think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space . i live in new york city and before putting it in my car i walked with the gps unit in my hands . perhaps because of the tall buildings and the slow walking speed it took more than 30 minutes for it to initially receive a satellite signal . i was convinced it was defective . it 's not . once i put it on the dash of my car and began driving it acquired a satellite signal within a few minutes . this unit comes with a 128mb micro sdcard onto which you can load a few state maps at one time . i ordered a 1gb micro sdcard along with this gps ( for approx . $ 11 on amazon ) and loaded all of north america at one time . this eliminates the need to re-load maps when traveling anywhere in the country . it 's worth the extra effort . this unit can be quickly moved from one car to another , especially a rental car anywhere in north america . my very first test of this thing was on the very complicated underpasses and overpasses in northern manhattan and the bronx . it was flawless ! it 's impossible to get lost with this thing . occasionally i 've made a turn too early or too late and within seconds it will re-calculate the best route . the combination of the voice prompts , the highlighted route you need to go , and the current and next street ( s ) at the top are excellent . also , the estimated arrival time in the lower left is nice , but does not account for traffic jams . the arrival time will just keep getting pushed back the slower you travel . it 's kind of a `` best traffic scenario '' prediction . this is so easy to use i 'm thinking of buying one for my 68-year-old mother who does n't have a clue when it comes to technology , but i 'm convinced she could use this without a problem ( once i 've loaded the maps for her . ) if not having bluetooth and all the other latest bells and whistles on a gps system does n't bother you ( as it does n't bother me ) buy this , you wo n't be sorry !
0	i wanted to replace a lexar 1gb with this , but i 'll keep looking . i used it to transfer a 700mb , 2300 file my documents folder to a new pc . the transfer seemed pretty slow , but deleting those files from the sandisk took *61* minutes ! back it goes
1	this is an exact replacement for the high quality , precision made suction cup mount that comes packaged with the nuvi unit . unlike many such suction cup products , this one sticks . i bought an extra for ease in `` cross-decking '' my one nuvi unit between my two cars . i just leave the mounts in place on the windshields of both cars and move the nuvi and power cord to whichever car i am using at the moment . a good convenience . note that i attach this mount to the windshield . i have not tried the red-disc mounting plate that allows the mount to be attached to a pebbly-textured dashboard ... i was scared off by the warning that ones you attach the red disk it is extremely hard to remove .
1	before adding this antenna to my wireless router , i had unreliable connections . since adding it , i consistently get the high speed connection i 'm paying for .
1	i am new to this type of device , but it has performed as expected
1	i use this with a pc running on windows xp home edition sp2 and it works marvels . damn , i did n't even need to install the drivers that came with it . i just grabbed the usb cable , plugged it in and started making sequences on sonar 4 . no latency , nothing . i recommend this product for both pc and mac users
0	you will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the panasonics that cost about the same . this is my main problem - the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there . 1 - the speakers are lightweight and shoddily built . they sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about . they are fairly light weight - meaning very small magnets in them . these are 3 way speakers - for really good sound on the cheap - speakers need to be 2 way ! 2 - the sound input consists of a headphone type jack in front . not even standard phono inputs at the back . 3 - its advertised as 320 watts - which is meaningless - since the speakers suck . what good is a high power amp with crappy speakers . and in case you know some audio - 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts ( log relationship ) . for some reason , this is not even half as loud as my 100 w receiver ! 4 - no user adjustable equalizer , only presets possible 5 - can not connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the `` biamping '' type of connections . 6 - the receiver sucks - even my sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver . i concur with the other reviewer - death to sony ! shame on them for taking consumers for a ride . this company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it `` competively '' with the others - meaning - fat profit margins .
0	there is something quite wrong with the laser mouse 6000 , the shape is not right , it 's kind of shallow . i have to be conscious every time i grab this mouse so that i do n't to hit the side buttons . all in all , terrible
1	great price for a 128mb jump drive , works perfectt for my daughters college work , such a good price i bought
0	i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years . i purchased three for my mac and pc at home . then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit . currently only one still works ! i have very infrequent power outages , perhaps three in the past four years . these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down . my g5 mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch lcd . i ca n't comment on other ups brands such as belkin , but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores . there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apc 's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand . my experience over the past four years has been mixed . these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes . if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear . i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms . many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance . the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years . i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years ; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries . prices vary from $ 15 to $ 50 depending on the vendor . battery life depends on many factors so i do n't begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable . i bought apc branded batteries and ca n't explain why the recurrent failures . i 'm frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model . just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an ups
0	really wo n't use the tv , but the cd only lasted 5 days and i use it everyday -- had to buy something else
1	the product description is incorrect , usb 2.0 works fine on the newer macs that have such ports . it 's overpriced ; buy a gently-used one
1	this card is one of the best , the graphics are very high ! i play games at full specs , needs a big chassis because generates heat , i did bought a tt armor and my system works better , easy installation .
1	ca n't say enough good things about this brother all-in-one , given its price and features . ( i paid $ 100 more than the new amazon price elsewhere a week ago . ) i installed as a network device and set up the software on my xp pro as well as mac os 10.4.9 machines ... easy installation , and the interface on each os is essentially the same . super fast prints from either machine , crisp and beautiful , with tonal background fills printing which never showed up on my previous hp laser . duplex scan/fax as well as duplex print was the key to my purchase , and i 've been really happy . what i did not anticipate was just how fast the printer is , or how rich the delivered software is compared with prior hp experience . noises do n't seem unusual to me - no crackling here , just noisy paper handling by adf and print engine . no big deal imho . only a few minor negatives i 've seen so far : ( 1 ) it looks like the firmware can only be updated from a windows computer , so mac folks are stuck there ( mine was delivered with current version of firmware , so maybe this does n't matter ) , ( 2 ) you can not feed heavy stock through it , even the manual feed tray - so need to keep a straight feed device around if you need thicker than 24 # stock , ( 3 ) scanner transfer rate to computer is a bit slow - not sure if it is the network interface or a slow processor in the device , and ( 4 ) expansion memory is not a popular size , so is more expensive than current pc memory - not sure if i 'll upgrade or not . have n't tried envelopes yet , so ca n't respond to earlier comments from others . it 's kind of entertaining to watch the machine do a duplex copy - as pages in the adf suck in and out to scan both sides , and pages ejecting come partway out and suck back in to copy the back side
1	alot better then wrapping the neck strap around your arm or hand ... it really depends on what kind of photography you do . i shoot at night clubs and weight can add up . i have a canon rebel xt , hand grip with 2 batties , canon 550ex flash , and 50mm f/1.4 or 17-40mm f/2.8 it feels alot better using the hand strap ...
1	this is the best value you can get . awesome picture with 10,000:1 contrast ratio . my xbox 360 looks amazing with 1080i resolution . definitely worth the money . you would not be disappointed with this tv .
1	this is a great product for those who probably do n't write too much . as an engineering student , i found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable - however , it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class . plus , it would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally
1	this is by far the best radio i 've ever had for singing in the shower . no more fumbling and messing with the dial while i 've got soap in my eyes ... 10 fm presets , 5 am presets and 5 tv presets + weather , i 'm always able to find something good to listen to . it works great for when i 'm out in the yard doing some work as well .
0	these headphones have no bass whatsoever . i would never buy these , please keep shopping as there are better products for the money out there . the headphones that came with my mp3 player out of the box are way better then these
1	i purchased 2 for my son and husband . both rumble and work perfectly with the racing games such as need for speed underground 2 , nascar 2003 and 2004 . some of the early games can not be used , but they still love it . the wheels actually feel like you are in a race car with realistic resistance . i recommend this item
0	some of the worst dvds that i have purchased . i would n't waste my money on any more of these pos discs . i wish i could return them to amazon , but for what i paid ( it was pretty cheap ) , its not worth the effort .
0	anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds . i know because i just did it . the cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire . you could even use household scissors to gnaw through . having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer . however , if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer , you might as well get something with a stronger cable
0	if your router is not by d-link , and particularly if you use wpa encryption with that router , do not purchase the dgl-3420 . i have tested it with both the linksys wrt54g and the smc 2804wmbp-g , and wpa fails with both of them . d-link technical support , in fact , has confirmed that they know the adapter does n't work using wpa with the wrt54g . besides , for significantly less money you can get a wireless bridge with a lot more functionality . after this product failed for me , i purchased the netgear wgps606 , which can connect four items ( x-box , computer , whatever ) to your wireless network and two wireless print servers , all for $ 20 less ( on amazon )
1	i purchased three of these for three kodak easyshare cameras i gave as gifts . it was a great buy for much less than what you can get at any local stores
0	looks and feels nice . but when dropped on concrete or ceramic floors ir will snap . both broke the same way within a few weeks . i 'm looking for the original all-plastic stylus
1	we purchased this tv in dec of 2006 . we are very happy with it . it was very easy to plug and play ... had it ready in no time for holiday ... i would definitely recommed it to new buyers
1	very satisfied with sound quality and ease of use . before purchasing , i did believe that these were noise canceling . however , that is not the case . the foam inserts do reduce background noise enough that i am very satisfied with the result . replacement foam inserts must be purchased online
1	outstanding item . plenty of room to carry dvds . enough padding to protect the player , but not too bulky
1	unlike the first reviewer my experience with trigger finer has been a good one . at first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in impulse ( ableton live ) once i realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze . i suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as m audio states ... .it is program and play , however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless . the htinkg is it is soo expandable and programmable it may be to its own detriment especaiily for peolle who are not fimiliar with mapping out midi controllers
1	i am very pleased with this item . it is fits comfortably , holds my cd player snugly and has room for my id , keys , extra batteries cd 's
0	i 've rarely had bad experiences with microsoft mice or keyboards . usually they tend to have above average design and put thought into the product . they evidently did n't hire the `` good '' designer to work on this product however as this mouse has 2 glaring faults . # 1 : the shallow height and shape of the mouse is such that it offers no support for your hand whatsoever . this causes hand strain and inconsistent hand placement as you use it . you never get the feeling that your hand is in `` the right position '' . # 2 : the side buttons are in brain dead locations . why this is i have no idea , as other microsoft models put the left side button right where your thumb would be if you move your thumb up slightly ( the way it should be ) . on this `` gaming '' mouse the left thumb button is much too far forward causing you to have to practically re-adjust your grip on the mouse just to press it . couple this with problem # 1 and the lack of surface contact with your hand causes the mouse to skew under your hand as you press the button thus turning your player to one side when you did n't intend to . just what you do n't want when throwing a grenade . the right button is sort of click-able with your pinky and is actually the more accessible button , but it feels more due to luck than planning . i have to wonder if they even tested this design with any gamers at all before putting it out on the street . i give it 2 stars because for the attempt at wireless feel with the thin cord , and it looks visually appealing . calling this a `` gaming '' mouse however and charging a premium for it is a joke you should spare yourself being the butt of . rating : not recommended
1	i bought this sd card and took some 100 snaps out of it.the card is really fast with my canon a510 camera.reading takes a slightly longer time than writing.i would recommend this card to anyone.actually this card outperforms the 16mb mmc supplied with the camera.also the 256mb card will hold upto 200 ( may be lesser ) 3.2mp pictures .
0	bought it for my nokia n80 and it does n't work ... typical ! should n't have bought a generic memory ! ! serves me right ! anyway..
0	i have to rate this product and this company as horrible ! ! i purchased the x2 in 12/2004 . everything was fine . in 6/2005 , the lamp blew . less than 300 hours on it ! ! ! i called the company . they said sometimes it happens . i questioned the projector . they said i just needed a new lamp . $ 300.00 later ... ..oh , you can only get the lamps from them . you can only get service on the x2 from them . i get the new lamp . it just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be . additionally , the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew . maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago ( when it was still under warranty but they would n't look at it ! ! ! ) no . they say no . the projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place . the projector was blown clean on a regular basis . this projector was not mistreated or misused . infocus says `` sometimes this happens '' . they , for $ 250 , plus $ 30.00 shipping , will fix the fan . i also need to buy a new lamp-another $ 300 . the company keeps saying- '' it is out of warranty '' , `` sometimes this happens '' , `` 1400 hours is just what some lamps get '' , etc. , etc , . etc.. they will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product . i will get a new projector-i can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one . my new projector will not/will never be an infocus product . they have failed to stand behind their product . their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties . do n't buy infocus ! ! !
1	after enduring the so-so performance of my stock ipod headphones , i figured it was time to step up . as i travel constantly , i wanted something that would would block out exterior noise ; as a music freak i wanted something that would sound great . after countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get ( ue vs. shure vs. etymotics ) i bought the super.fi 5 pros . in the end it was the price , amazon was selling then for $ 90 less than the msrp . ca n't beat that . as soon as they were delivered i hooked them up and put them on . they are n't kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down . i keep the volume on my ipod way down , a fraction of what i kept it at with the stock headphones . the room i was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open , so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement . with the ues on , it was just me and the music . a fire engine thundered by , normally a painfully annoying experience . again , the ues reduced it to the point that i did n't realize the fire engine was coming until i saw it drive by . as for the music . i first played a couple of tracks by jenny lewis and the watson twins . i immediately noticed elements to the music i never even heard with my other headphones . jenny lewis ' angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like i was listening to them for the first time . next i put on some ray charles . with the ues , it was like i was there in the front row . the horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while i discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section . i 've read complaints that in ear headphones do n't produce enough bass , so i decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from siamese twin by the smashing pumpkins . while i 'm not by any means a bass head , i need some bass to enjoy rock albums . i could n't have been happier with how the ues performed . the drums in the album ( which i 've always considered some of the best ) came alive . the guitars actually had some balls , but did n't overpower the singing or drums . as is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time , your ears are bound to hurt a little . i found this to be the case only for a day or two , after that the ues fit snugly without any complaint . the only weird thing i encountered had to do with ear wax . my wife , an audiologist , forbids the family from using q-tips . so after taking the ues off for the first couple of times , there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones . like the discomfort , this earwax experience only lasted for the first couple of times i used the ues , and with the supplied earwax cleaner it was really a non issue . when there are so many excellent products out there , finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging . i 've never tried on shures or etymotics , so i ca n't compare the performance of those headphones and the ues . what i do know is that i got a really great deal on the best headphones i 've ever had . without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones i will buy for some time .
0	i wanted some earbuds for my zen player which fit in my ears and would n't fall out . these earbuds did fit my ears . however , a month after starting to use them one channel went out and now i have sound coming out of only one earbud . also , i have no idea why these are called , `` high quality '' earbuds , unless it was a sales tactic . the sound quality is not as good as the sound of the original zen earbuds . i am back to using the original buds , but i 'm $ 20 lighter in the pocketbook . i was dissatisfied with this purchase
1	when compared to other 1st generation ipod shuffle armbands , this one is just as good , if not better , and you ca n't beat the price . definitely worth every penny
0	good product , forget about service . i e-mailed infocus about my faulty projector 8th january 2005 it is now 7th january 2006 and i still do not have my projector . that 's right , it 's been one year since my projector stopped working , i have given up on it being repaired ( it was under warranty ) and am now struggling to get it back so that i can repair it out of my own pocket . check this company 's record at the better business bureau , it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints
0	this philips hts3400 dvd has all the features i need , but its mp3 player is really bad : audio just pops before moving to a next song . it looks like what philips ' people just do in all of their electronics . i really do n't want to talk about this any more because william r. french and a. isaicu all talke about these problems
1	in comparison to the component cables , the quality is a little better . i do n't think i agree with those who say you must have hdmi cables to get a good picture , but i am extremely satisfied with the product and i do n't regret purchasing it . amazon 's price for this product is unmatched
1	i have purchased over two dozen of these units . this is the best unit for the price . there are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit . this allows you to be certain that your feed is being input . also the card slots are a plus . two things to be aware of . if you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use . apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in . also if you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required . not a one disc does all unit
0	this phone stopped working just right after i threw all the packing material away . horrible , horrible static . non user friendly buttons as well . i wish i could have returned it . do not buy this phone
1	these dvds never fail ... i 've tried other brands and had miserable results . stick with memorex and you wo n't be sorry
1	overall this is a very good remote . it replaced 5 of my remotes , which is all except my bose , which is rf controlled . it even replaced my windows media center edition remote and works with my ps2 with no problems . my negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions are n't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set-up . these negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices . i am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again
1	i reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as i have n't authored or copied very many dvds with it yet . however , what i have accomplished with it is commendable . i can copy an entire commercial dvd ( movie + all the extras ) under 50 minutes . i have composed a slide show dvd with my own mp3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it . so far , no coasters . i am now in the process of producing dvds of my old 8mm home movies . the converter is giving me more problems than anything . still recommend the px-755uf for anyone interested in an external burner . installation was a snap ( plug-n-play )
1	yep everything is very cool ... clarity ... etc..but they should do something about clipping in the head of laptop..it is just dancing while i keep it on laptop .
1	plenty of room for our hpa612 printer and a friend bought the same one for her hpa617 . pockets for extra paper . shoulder strap for even more ease in transporting the printer .
1	i would encourage anyone in the market for a shredder to first identify where the machine is to be placed ! if you want something `` cute '' and compact , then , keep looking . this sb-97cs is a work horse , in every sense of the word . consequently , it may not appeal to one 's feminine traits . although the size can be a bit formidable for home use , it 's power and relatively quiet operation set the standard for all others . i was surprised at just how quiet it was ! the controls are easy to master , and the safety features are good to have for the occasional inquisitve child . having had a lessor ( un-named ) shredder , i knew that my shredding needs were beyond the waste-paper-basket sized machines for less money . being one who regularly shreds credit card `` bait '' checks , and other sensitve info that accumulates through the years , this sb-97cs shredder was a must have . i doubt that i 'll outgrow this machine . i 've had this shredder for only a couple of months now , and i expect to have it for many years to come . it is necessary to oil the cutters after each full basket , though . if you are the disciplined and conscientious type , this is not a problem . however , i can see the lifespan of this machine being cut short by the negligent types who do n't read instructions..
0	i previously purchased a siig firewire 800 expresscard . after several weeks with siig tech support i 'm told it is a known issue that card wo n't work with dell laptops . so ... i phoned belkin techsupport before buying this card . they tell me they know of no such problems . well , card gives exact same problem as siig ! works fine on firewire 400 but the minute you use 1394b ( firewire 800 ) drivers , my dell inspiron 9400 bluescreens and reboots ! emailed and phoned belkin tech support but no response/solution . from my experience , dell inspiron 9400/e1705 's ca n't support firewire 800 . update : after almost 2 months of trying to get a resolution from belkin , they advise their product development team is `` still working on the problem '' . would i recommend buying a belkin product , no way , that level of customer service is a disgrace
0	stylish , comfortable , good sound quality ... and utterly useless at noise cancelation . great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat-side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes , and you 'll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight . perhaps there 's a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box . i suggest you insist on this . sure , turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise , but as far as i can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume .
0	are you serious ? i bought this a while ago to see if it was cool . it is a piece of junk , u can barely get any channels , and even if you do , you can barely see them and it has loud static . dont buy it its garbage
0	this item was not practical . it looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
0	ok ... . i bought one of these as a refurb thinking that it was a great bargain ... hey 5gb for less than $ 100 what a deal . once you get the hang of loading and working with the windows media player its not a big deal to load . unfortunately after it begins locking up and not recognizing songs ( which requires a drive reformat and reinstallation of the songs ) you get really good at it . had it for about 4 months before it stopped even recognizing the hd and no longer worked at all . i thought maybe the reason was that i had bought a refurb so a new one had to be better ... right ? so i stupidly bought a brand new one.. again less than $ 100 . this one has now begun the lock up and reload problem within 2 months of reciept and i just recently got the `` not recognizing the hd '' message . i am in hopes of getting it to work but for right now its just an expensive paperweight . i am 0/2 with these players so i do n't believe that they are worth the shipping it takes to send them back . beware of this product
1	works as it should . it 's enough for my needs and handles simultaneous activity on all ports well . not an unbearable dropoff in performance while say , transferring huge files to an external hard drive , while burning a dvd , and fiddling with the ipod . if you 're like me and you need your laptop to do a little more without adding to desk clutter uneccesarily , this should suit you fine
0	i bought one of these about 3 days ago and it 's already broken . i try to charge my ipaq1940 with the suggested tip and the adapter begins to continually reset my pda . not only that , but it drains rather than charges the battery . this is an extremely overpriced piece of junk , you 'd be better off taking the large amount of money you would invest buying this product and consolidating whatever various devices you 're trying to charge into one smart phone/pda/whatever that does everything you want
1	i really needed a printer with a scanner so i could store my important files digitally . this printer works great.. i would recommend to change to the lower resolution so it will operate faster . it can scan color also but that takes a loooong time . b has been sufficient for me ; scans quickly for those . printout quality is excellent
0	i do n't even use it anymore , did n't think it was that great . i got a gel rest from fellows , a lot better ...
0	as with some of the other reviewers , mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter . i bought a vector brand inverter at wal-mart and it is much better
1	ive owned a couple cb 's and this is definitely one of the better ones ( the only ones that are better are substancially more expensive ) . works great and can be mounted in dash because of the front firing speaker . tons of features including scanning and weather ( which actually comes in very handy ) . the only feature it lacks ( and i wish it had ) is the ability to hook up to a pa. other than that its great
0	dear sir/madam : its very difficult to email you regarding things i ca n't find. ! or you do n't sell ? i am looking for hp black ink . # 20 for 656c printer . now , you tell me which ink i need ? no way you can tell. ! ! because you are not selling or what ? you site is very difficult to find ink i need
0	i would love to try this . first one was shipped broken ( make a clanking noise and woulnd't work ) . sent it back and got a new one that did n't read a dvd . i may try one more time . its pretty heavy , but i am hoping the larger screen is better then other small portables or i-pod type machines
1	everything works great . the only marginal issue is that the batteries do n't last a full eight hours . it works in the car but cuts in and out . guess i have to break down and buy the car kit
1	i ordered a pair of these online , a bit nervous as i was n't ever able to hear them ( i heard a pair of jbl sp6c 's , the cheaper version , at best buy , and was n't all that impressed , although it might have been the poor listening environment ) . anyway , the speakers arrived , we installed them ( they look great and inconspicuous in our living room ceiling ) and i 'm quite impressed . note that we 're using these for `` whole-house '' background music , not home theater , so my standards are n't as high as they would be in the ht case . but for a 6.5 '' speaker , these put out a surprising amount of bass , and clear highs . right now we just have a cheap amplifier hooked up while we 're shopping for a better one , and they still sound great . these probably would be just fine for ht rear-speaker use ( i would n't want any in-ceiling speaker for front or center ht use ) . our home theater downstairs already has jbl speakers ( studio series for the fronts and center , northridge for the rears ) and i 've been very happy with them . i recommend these for those who need a great looking and decent sounding in-ceiling speaker without breaking the bank .
1	we bought this external drive after learning that our friends lost all but a couple months worth of photos and/or videos from their first year with adorable triplet daughters . it resulted from the dreaded and inevitable hard-drive crash that everyone fears , but nobody thinks will happen to them . attempts by two data recovery firms were unsuccessful and now they 're left with whatever printed photos they and their family and friends could find . expecting our first child in less than three weeks , we do n't want to find ourselves in the same predicament , especially with years of other irreplaceable photos , financial data and other documents on our laptop . now we 're doing weekly , monthly and annual backups and storing some of those offsite to protect against something even worse than a simple crash of a hard drive . even if we do n't completely stick with this new regimen , it 's better than what we used to do -- which , though thankfully uneventful , was absolutely nothing . if that 's not enough to make you want to buy this , then the sony name , quality , reliability and ease of use should be . the drive is small , stylish , easily installed and takes up little space in the vertical position . although it 's a little loud when the drive is working , it reads and writes cd-r media up to 48x , ultra speed plus cd-rw up to 32x , dvd+/-r up to 16x , and high speed dvd+rw up to 8x . after a lengthy initial full backup using the included nero backitup software ( about 8 gb onto 10 old cd-r discs in 2.5-3.0 hours ) , smaller differential monthly backups and incremental weekly backups to 8x dvd+rw discs take between 10 and 20 minutes each when compressing , copying and verifying everything . backup copies of our 4 gb wedding dvd onto 8x dvd-r discs took about 15-20 minutes . the nero software seems very extensive , but i have n't used much of it so far . the interface is pretty intuitive and it 's easy to find what you want to do , but some of the more detailed or technical options might be overwhelming for someone who 's new to this kind of software or does n't want to spend a lot of time reading the pdf manual . the only real complaint i have is with the backitup program 's job scheduler , which only gives you daily , weekly and yearly frequency options ( you need to set up monthly backups as weekly jobs and either disable or skip them for several weeks in between months ) , it takes forever to re-scan files when building a new job on an existing one ( setting up subsequent daily , weekly or monthly jobs based on the initial full annual backup ) , and the data you can change for an existing job is limited ( ca n't rename it or alter the content without creating a whole new job ) . overall , great external dvd/cd drive for watching video , listening to music and backing up data . good software that 's intuitive and functional with some room for improvement , but there 's no real need for additional software you do n't already have . excellent value -- bought it at amazon for under $ 160 with taxes and free shipping , and got a $ 30 mail-in rebate from sony . also bought pack of 25 ritek 8x dvd+rw discs from thetechgeek.com for $ 33 delivered and they threw in a free 10-pack of velocity 8x dvd-r discs . so , for well under $ 200 and a little effort , you too can view , hear , copy and/or backup your valuable photos , videos , tunes and other data in no time
0	these work great initially ... i bought six of them . of the six , four broke . one stopped altogether , one stopped oscillating , and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed . i bought them in may and they broke after 2 , 3 , and 4 months , respectively . they are expensive fans , and i was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability . they were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all . i have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch . these are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty ( this is 1 year ) and higher quality components .
1	we looked at many tv stands to go with the sony tv we were buying . only a few were worth considering , but finally decided to go with the sony unit designed for our specific tv . am i glad we did ! it has hold downs to secure the tv and the cable straps at the rear are easy to use and make the installation clean and clear . very nicely designed , along with being good looking
0	these headphones have a dececent sound but genuinely no noice cancelling effect . the battery powers the speakers a bit which does make them a littel louder , but nothing special . as you see , the price is down to $ 22.00 which is probably a good price for these ( unfortunatly , i bought them at $ 50.00 and had to return them
0	i used to like my viking 512mb cf card a lot . i had such a card for more than a year . in that period , i used it in my camera . it 's filled up for several times . also occationally i use a card reader ( simpletech ) to write/read that card , to transfer some big files between computers . it 's all fine , and suddenly one day , when the card was half full , and after a card reader reading , i got `` cf card error '' on my camera . fortunately , after i delete a few pictures , i could move on . i gave the card to other people , so i do n't know how it 's doing now . after that , i purchased another viking 512mb , half year ago . i used it to transfer files for a few times , and have never filled it up using my camera yet . now i am getting consistent `` cf card error '' message on my camera , even after re-format for several times , while i do n't have that problem if i use another card . one theory i heard was that a card reader may damage a card . i can not verify though . anyway , i will have to buy another card now , and it wo n't be viking for this time . ===== one month later ===== i contacted with their customer support . they gave me a number for return , and i mailed back my damaged cf card . they sent back a new one in a week . the new one is working fine so far . the exchange was not difficult . they did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt . they only verified the serial number . that 's good
0	i have the same criticisms as many others . i had to put on rubber gloves to open the battery compartment . after turning it off after the first use , i could n't get it turned back on again and returned it to the store . i loved the size , but i bought a nice wireless by microsoft ; not a mini , but easy to use , a battery compartment that opens without difficulty , and a nifty little snap-in receiver that turns the mouse off automatically . take it out , put it in the usb port and the mouse is back on again . price was comparable , even though i pay a lot more for these items , living in the caribbean . amazon does not ship anything but books , cd 's and dvd 's to the caribbean
0	i had the tx-sr304 . everything sounded great . however , certain times when i played my dvd , the onyko produced a loud high-pitched ear-piercing sound . sounds almost like a record scratching . the most common times it made this sound was during the dvd menu , when it replays the music theme . the receiver would transition from dolby digital to stereo then back to dd again , then making that loud sound . everything was great , but this one problem made me return this item , which is a bummer because i would have kept it otherwise
0	man , were we diappointed with this ge phone ! we did everything right -- - '' trained '' the battery in the beginning , made sure we routinely charged it , never dropped or abused this phone , and then one day it started not holding a charge . we could n't figure it out . it worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out , just like the other reviewers have said . we had a 10-year old toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it 's unfortunate demise , which is when we acquired this loser . are there any good phones out there somewhere ? ? ?
0	i just wasted $ 16.35 on this piece of junk . it arrived quickly , and became unusable even faster . for those of you used to disposable screen covers , there is only one in this package ! the instructions say you can clean it , but it came out of the packaging with lint on it , which immediately adhered to the sticky side , and could not be cleaned off . since the package was opened , it could not be returned .
1	i 've held off reviewing this item until i actually got some alerts - and i got plenty of them over the weekend , so here it is ... . there seem to be a lot of complaints of this being hard to set-up - so many , that after having no problems setting it up myself , i 'd worried i 'd done something wrong . over the weekend , a number of thunderstorms tornados rolled thorough my area - using the s.a.m.e alert system for my county - i received a notification for each warning . i purchased this radio specifically for the s.a.m.e alert system , living in central mississippi , we get tornado warnings all spring - i did n't want a 2am alarm for a tornado 3 counties north of me . my one beef with the unit is the radio reception - even the included external antenna , it 's spotty - especially the weather radio reception . i 'm not sure how far i am from the nearest weather radio transmitter , but living in the suburbs of madison , i ca n't be too far . if you 're in a rural area , i 'd definitely look into getting an external antenna ( it has a port for a better external antenna than the telescoping antenna included )
0	for the price this is not a bad keyboard . here are the two major problems i have with it : 1 ) the feel is nothing like a real piano . the keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note . 2 ) the instructions have a big sticker on them , stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and/or birth defects ( including lead ) and to `` wash your hands after handling '' . how on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot , very possibly by children ? it 's going back ...
1	it 's a decent mic for just a few bucks . it works adequately , and has an on/off switch , and an xlr connector . it comes with a xlr-to-1/4 cord . if you 're going to plug this mic into a mixer , be sure to get a xlr-to-xlr cord . the volume of the mic , when connected to a mono 1/4 jack with the included cable , was almost inaudible . with a xlr-to-xlr cord , it was at normal volume levels compared with other equipment
0	i bought this as a backup drive several months ago for my home business after the iomega backup drive i was using crashed and took my backup with it . the maxtor software installs automatically when you plug in the drive so that part was really easy and it took just a few minutes . the initial backup was really easy and went pretty fast too . so far , so good . the problem is that once the initial backup takes place the backup function does n't backup new or updated files ! the scheduled backup does n't work at all . the light flashes so you think it 's working but it does n't backup any new or updated files . the synch is useless too . it 's like the backup function . it will synch your files one time but then after that it does n't synch any of your new or updated files like it 's supposed to . it 's like it takes a snapshot of your computer at a specific time and that 's it . to get around the fact that it wo n't automatically back up my files i have to manually transfer my files every few days or so which is a real pain as i have to remember what files have been updated and/or are new . i would not buy this product again . it 's not an automatic backup drive , it 's just an external drive that will back up one time but then is n't reliable at all . if you need a backup drive look elsewhere . sorry to say , this one is a complete waste of money .
0	c. musselman can add 2 more cards to his connector problem . i have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not have proper fittings for the external antenna - i plan to return it all . avoid this product
1	ha sido una buena compra , es un procesador rapido y efeciente en las tareas multimedia
0	waste of time . software had some bugs but more importantly performance was horrible . i would n't pay 10 dollars for this product- yes it is that bad . accuracy rate was about 25 % and the mistakes were beyond spell check . they look like some new form of reformed egyption . do n't buy !
0	i just bought a 25 pack of these along with my new liteon dvd burner . to bad only half of the cd players in my house can even read them . i dont ' think its the lightscribe side thats causing the problem as it does n't seem to matter if i `` lightscribe '' them or not . the burner works fine with all of the other media i 've tried so i 'd avoid these discs like the plague
0	these are some of the worst ear buds i have heard since the very first ones came out . voices are muted , highs are muddy , and lows are non-existant . the only redeeming feature is since they are marketed as `` surround sound '' ( yeah right ... ) they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear my callers .
1	there are over 100 reviews . i am not saying the same thing again . i just throw my rating in . all i can say is ... you will be better off if you completely learn how to master this calculator
0	i purchased the rino 130 specifically because it also had the radio and noaa features . fortunately i read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance . i tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible , and i was able to return the unit to amazon in time for a full refund . be sure to test this yourself . also the buttons are very small , and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down . i returned the rino 130 and purchased a garmin etrex legend c ( color display ) for about the same price . i will miss the noaa feature of the 130 but not the radio . this is an overpriced gps . spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed
0	i bought this phone for the great features and because i 've had good luck with other motorola products . the phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have . the handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit . the only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings . range on the handsets is only mediocre , i ca n't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located . also , battery life is very limited . overall the phones are very disappointing and i would definitely recommend not buying them .
0	memorex jewel case arrived with many cases broken , the tkd is has probably thicker and more duarabl
1	item works perfectly fine . a little slow on the shipping , so i suggest getting the faster shipping with the purchase of your item . my experience could not have been better . excellent job thank you very much . great experience .
1	i 've owned this pocket pc for a week now with very little problems . i do n't know anything about an upgrade but so far i have n't had any major problems with it . when i left it in the car and then came home it would n't turn on . i noticed it was very warm but as soon as i did a soft reset the device turned on . the soft reset does n't make you lose all your data . i just had to reset the date . i 've had to do this a couple of times so far . i did purchase a 2 gig sd card and have lots of room . i recommend that you shop around for the 2 gig memory card however because i bought mine from amazon and then i found it cheaper at best buy . i am really happy with this product . i love the way it looks . it 's easy to figure out and i 'm not really savvy with electronic gadgets . i did sign up for hotmail so i could use the msn features . it was easy to sync my music to the device and the download is done automatically with the sync . the music sounds great with a great pair of headphones . i use the calendar which helps to remind of events and appointments . also use the task button which reminds of stuff that needs to be done . great for the highly stressed out who tend to forget things . there is also a feature to write a note in your own handwriting and then the device turns it into typewritten words . really neat ! i use the recording device to record my class lecture and it 's a little hard to hear but there is a lot of noise in the classroom and i sit in the back and the teacher is up at the front . but the important thing is that i could understand what was being said so i could transcribe it . as a nursing student i was able to purchase and download nursing programs from a website with no problems and they run great . i just ca n't believe all the features that come with this pocket pc . i have no regrets making this purchase . i look forward to reading more reviews on this product and learning everything it can do . so far it 's been fun
0	it works if there 's a direct line of sight to the reciever . in other words , if the ipod is lying down horizontally , it wo n't respond . you 'll want to use a dock or something else to prop it up vertically for it to work
0	i wanted to convert an hp laserjet 4 plus to a networked printer . even though instructions from the manual was followed , the printer did not work . the customer support is claimed to be 24/7 , but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet . this product cost more than a linksys router . so customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time
1	i had a 1st generation shuffle and upgraded to a 60gb video which i adore ! however , i found that whenever i went running i was stealing my old shuffle back from my daughter . i bought this shuffle for my husband and fell in instant love with it . i really like how portable it is and you ca n't beat being able to just clip it onto your clothing . no arm straps , no more lanyards . so now i have the 60 gig for my entire library of music and videos and the shuffle for exercise
1	the printer is fast and printing is always properly aligned on the paper . quality of printed text is as good as any decent desktop printer and that is why i bought it in the first place . i am yet to try printing photos . because this is a mobile printer the manufacturer needs to ensure that the unit will stand up to the hits and accidents caused by regular transporting . it might mean providing a second skin or a padded bag with the uni
0	if these were free , i 'd still would not recommend them , due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings . it is the discs , i must assume , since my burner works fine with other brands . anyway , ( now ) i think it 's best to invest a bit more and get good media..
1	when you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great , but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate . it really seems to run out of one color much quicker than the others . personally its usually red . it has caught me with my pants down a couple times , going to print out a project the night before its due , only to run out of red or blue ink . i would definetly suggest to always have an extra one around just in case
0	would of been great to receive so i could of gotten some use of i
1	i recently purchased the item and knew that some assembly was required . i did n't know that i would be soldering components onto a printed circuit board . that 's ok . i was an electronic technician in a former life but it might pose a problem to who might purchase this item expecting a snap together kit
0	it is very hard to update the remote . very seldom we can delete and if there are two dvr boxes remote get confused and keep on turning off and on , even though we choose the right one such as a or b.software update is cumbersome and take 45 minutes on a intel quad computer with 2 g memory . can supply some patches . i have the remote sitting on my coffee table useless .
1	i just purchased the archos 604 about 3weeks ago . so far so good . it interfaces very easily with the computer . though i have not tried it using windows media 10 yet . i recommend at least buying the archos docking adapter kit ( if you do not plan on using the archos to record programs ) . it allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos . the only negative that i have so far is that the volume , at its highlest level , is difficult to hear on an airplane . you may need some noise canceling headphones
1	this armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen ( stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector ) . it works well for jogging and working out . the neoprene ( better than leather for sweaty workouts ) armband fits well on my upper arm ( 6 ' 200lb ) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms . it is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place . i first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so i now just clip it in which seems to work fine . it has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but i think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband . i have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and i am satisfied at this point , i am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included . also on another note , apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors i have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception . the button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly . all in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it 's a solid value .
1	the lexar jumpdrive lightning 2gb flash drive has very impressive performance ratings of 160x ( 24mb/sec ) sustained read and 120x ( 18mb/sec ) sustained write speed capability . this is one of the very few usb drives that lists the read/write speed capabilities . the `` reality '' of flash drives is that the smaller the file size , the slower the transfer rate will be . i ran some tests with the lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes : * 433mb 784 medium files , avg . 550kb 12x 4 min . 3 sec . * 483mb 81 large files , avg . 6mb 54x 59 seconds * 1gb 1 very large file 115x 58 seconds so , even though the write speed capability of the lightning is 120x , the transfer rate drops to 12x with medium size files , which is fairly `` real-world '' usage . but , do n't let that dissuade you from considering the lightning : the higher the `` speed capability '' of the device , the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files . to prove this point , i took one of my `` great deal '' cf cards ( that had no speed ratings ) that tops out at 36x read / 7x write , and ran two of the same tests : * 433mb 784 medium files 3x 15 min . 10 sec . * 483mb 81 large files 7x 7 min . 48 sec . so , compared to the lightning , the `` great deal ! '' card took nearly 4 times longer to write the medium files and 8 times longer to write the large files . so , which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over ... whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a usb flash drive , if the performance numbers are not specified , beware ! what you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing . i know , i have several in my drawer . so , my bottom-line advice is : look for the highest-rated device you can find . flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow ! so `` future-proof '' your purchase by shopping for a high-rated and large capacity for now and the future . ( i have no relationship with lexar or the flash memory industry .
0	they clean the screen , so to speak , but also leave a slight film behind which can be seen when the monitor is off . it does n't really affect viewing while the monitor is actually on , but i still do n't like the fact that the screen is not completely clean after treatment . the monitor would have been cleaner overall had i just wiped it with a dry lint free cloth . perhaps some people would view this film as a relatively minor flaw , since it does n't affect picture during use , but regardless , i am extremely disappointed to pay money for a product specifically marketed as a screen cleaner with results anything other than excellent . i thought these would be a solution but they 've turned out to be just another problem i have to figure out .
0	i have never written a review like this before but felt compelled to do so in this case . those considering purchase of this printer should be aware that the claim that it will work with pict bridge connections is not true . i purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple printer to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids . she and i both have newer nikon digitals and the pictbridge connection will not work with mine at all . with hers , we can make a connection and , following drections carefully , we can get it to 'energize ' the printer but the printer will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality . the printer will not pull the paper though properly . ( we have even changed batteries in the camera to no avail and had a tech savvy son-in-law look at it . ) i read reviews by others , but feel this printer is simply not reliable . i wanted to share our bad experience with those of you evauating a purchase . in my opinion , canon should be more forthcoming with claims about interface with other cameras . i 'm in the process of trying to return it to amazon . we 're going to buy an hp , which i should have done initially . thank you
1	very good product.. actually came with a bonus 8 cd sleeve to attach to a car visor for free . very happy with the produc
0	there are no instructins of anykind or anything with this item , and it says it is also a 5 gig mp3 player , well it comes with no software or anything else . if all u want is speakers to plug in its your bag if u want more forget i
0	i knew better , but i did it anyway , thinking that it would be a good compromise ( we have ibm , dell , and toshiba laptops and a sony really nice monitor ) . no modem port ( not a surprise , but would have been nice ) , the video display is , well , you can see stuff on the monitor . one of the usb ports is n't reliable . i could go on , but you get the picture . do n't bother
0	i was ( wrongly ) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo . be sure your computer is supported , because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing , so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer . so amazon , as usual , graciously took it back . love amazon . i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work
0	i have no axe to grind with bose . i originally bought this speaker for a custom cabinet with almost no room for a center channel set up . this speaker has an incredibly small footprint . if space is limited , this is not a bad option . however , being honest , this is not a great center channel speaker . choosing speakers is like the addage `` certain horses for certain courses . '' your budget , your room , your components - all play a part . i have two home theater setups . one is a daily gathering area with basic in wall treatments from polk audio . the other is a dedicated theater utilizing definitive technologies with b reference 7.1 processing . clearly the bose vcs-10 can not hold its own with my larger setup . however , i have run it with my polk audio 's and it was workable . the timbre match was slightly off and the vocals were not as sharp as they are with my polk csi3 but it was not awful . my bottom line - you can certainly buy a better center channel speaker . can you buy a better one in this price range . i think so - if you are only focused on the quality of this one speaker and not the blended sound of your system . you should always buy the best components within your budget - but remember you are building a system - it 's not just about one speaker . if this speaker fits your space and ( more importantly ) matches your other speakers , then it may be the right speaker for you
0	i want to believe all of the positive reviews ; i really do ! but at the moment i 'm still having problems with the downloading and uploading of the firmware . i know , i know : do it in recovery mode ! whatever that is ! ( do n't worry , i 've been to the site and followed the directions 20+ times ! ) and as for customer support ... i got a message giving hours and `` good bye '' ( i did called during the hours cs was supposedly open ) . i had a mpio and wanted something more reliable but once again find the software package and manual ( so big and so little information ! ) are not intuitive or easy to use . maybe the mac nation is right . and as for that first review posted here on amazon.com , i hope that guy got a bonus ; he must be working for cowan ! don
1	it does work/live with dsl installed on the same line , ever heard of dsl filters ? too small ? are you kidding ? this phone is great all around
0	cheap and definitely nasty - they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear-cups , but after a few months light use , i lost sound through one cup then the other . in general - when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on . the batteries seemed to last pretty long though - actually the battery i had in there lasted longer than the unit itself . very disappointing , but for the price , this is hardly unexpected
0	i wish they had a rating for zero stars . i bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters . that 's a 24 % success rate . i subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters . memorex has really gone downhill .
1	i bought this for my husbands birthday . he was very excited . he had been looking at bags at a local store and had n't found anything as nice as this , especially for the price . plenty of room for his laptop and pens , notebooks , extra books , etc . very durable , highly recommend
0	i bought this mouse hoping to use it with my new hp dv2000 laptop , with internal bluetooth , i was excited about the instant view feature and the lazer percision , however when i got the mouse connected it worked , but no instant viewer ? turns out the instant viewer only works if you have the dongle pluged in ... but ... the reason i bought a `` bluetooth '' mouse was in order to avoid a dongle breaking off in the side of my laptop . on top of all this the extra two buttons on the sides are awkwerd to press , i have to contort my fingers in a arthritus inducing cramp to press them , nothing like my old microsoft mouses ' cozy side button . the middel mouse button also is annoyingly resistant to press in order to activate mouse button three ... which is set to activate the `` amazing '' instant viewer , which is decent , but useless without the dongle . as far as lazer percision , not too noticable , my kingston rf lazer mouse seemed to preform better . the only reason i gave it a 2/5 is the charger is nice , the battery is good and it has a nice brushed aluminum finish , which feels nice and cool against the palm . this makes a decent desktop mouse , if you use the dongle which they include the connectivity is good and the percision is nice . not something i 'd recomend for a laptop user . for the price overall subpar
1	i bought this cooling fan because my computer was shutting off on its own , and the problem seemed to be that the computer was overheating . while this product has n't `` cured '' my computer , the performance of my computer has definitely improved with the use of the cooling fan . the extra usb ports are convenient as well . i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a laptop and wants to keep it from overheating
0	i have to rate this product and this company as horrible ! ! i purchased the x2 in 12/2004 . everything was fine . in 6/2005 , the lamp blew . less than 300 hours on it ! ! ! i called the company . they said sometimes it happens . i questioned the projector . they said i just needed a new lamp . $ 300.00 later ... ..oh , you can only get the lamps from them . you can only get service on the x2 from them . i get the new lamp . it just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be . additionally , the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew . maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago ( when it was still under warranty but they would n't look at it ! ! ! ) no . they say no . the projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place . the projector was blown clean on a regular basis . this projector was not mistreated or misused . infocus says `` sometimes this happens '' . they , for $ 250 , plus $ 30.00 shipping , will fix the fan . i also need to buy a new lamp-another $ 300 . the company keeps saying- '' it is out of warranty '' , `` sometimes this happens '' , `` 1400 hours is just what some lamps get '' , etc. , etc , . etc.. they will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product . i will get a new projector-i can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one . my new projector will not/will never be an infocus product . they have failed to stand behind their product . their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties . do n't buy infocus ! ! !
0	purchased md761 and 4 ea md71 for throughout house because patricia ( wife ) in wheelchair and on oxygen 24/7 . she could beep all phones in emergency and i would hear . first- sound terrible , second- after 1 month most phones good for less than 10 minutes usage and constantly dropping calls , third- phones quite often in 'searching ' mode when picked up for use . entered house to find wife unconcious and not breathing . started cpr and reached for phone to call 911 . phone in base beside her was searching ! ! ! ! ! ! ! stopped cpr and ran to another room for different brand phone and called 911 . resumed cpr . patricia died in spite of my and 911 personnel 's efforts . looking for someone i hate to give these 5 phones , my last motorola product
1	the case was very well made and sturdy . unfortunatly it was too small for my sony 7 in dvd portable player . returning it to amazon was quick and easy . i wish it would have fit .
0	very unreliable ... ... ... . i have used dvd rw and cd rw memorex disks on multiple computers and dvd recorders . i find that they ... ..1 ) do n't last ... .get about 50 re-recordings not 1500 2 ) may crap out on any occasion ... ... .multiple cd rw 's with critical material would not read on multiple computers . avoid memorex dvd rw cd rw disks !
1	very easy to assemble , has very classic lines , lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation , hard to find add-on shelf in maple . holds a lot of equipment
1	plenty of room for my creative zen nano player , ear buds and spare battery . i only wish for something other than black ! it is easy to misplace
1	the eyetv 2.x software is a bit rough around the edges ( compared to dish dvr and tivo ) , but it 's very usable and works great . i bought this so i can watch the maryland terrapins at work ( cbs mmod blacks out local games ) and it 's great to be able to infinitely adjust the video window . you can record the program and watch it at lunch or when you get a chance . you will need a good antenna and i wish they provided one like miglia . but guess what , you can buy the miglia magnetic antenna and it works better than many larger antennas from radio shack or target . the miglia antenna comes apart and can go with you on travel . imagine watching local hdtv on the road without having to use the hotel cable . [ ... ] product description : portable atsc antenna for tvmini hd . this antenna is not suitable for analog products such as tvmicro and tvmax . it works with the hybrid very nicely and only costs $ 15 us . it took 4 weeks to arrive , but it 's worth it and works much better than the two arial with loop antenna i got for 2x as much
0	maybe mine was broken , but i do n't think so because i could see a red light at all the cable ends . i connected the splitter to my sound card , a tb montego ddl , with a 1 ' cable and then tried both a 6 ' and 30 ' cable to my stereo . no signal whatever . both the 6 ' and 30 ' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card . i even used only the 6 ' and 30 ' cables in case the 1 ' was bad . still no signal . i think you need to have either a very , very , strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one , or use a powered splitter .
1	seems sturdy , however , it did not fit my tv . will not fit samsung lns 4692d
1	i was unsure of whether to purchase this product when i saw that my printer ( hp deskjet 712c ) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others ' reviews , i tried it anyway because the price was right . it may look a little cheesy but it works . i did n't even need the cd that comes with it in order to use the product . i just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new dell laptop and it worked . i think i may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it . very good product
0	i was very disappointed when i got to south america and went to curl my hair and nothing happened . take a look at the product specifications . it has limited use for appliances between 500 and 1600 watts . i had two different curling irons with me - one was rated 85 watts and the other 125 watts . i am not sure what appliances this converter was designed for . take my recommendation . buy the converter by tumi instead . it is twice the price , but it is one piece , easy to travel , and works with many different types of appliances . i am very satisfied with it .
0	these speakers , in one word , suck . i made the mistake of buying them because they were so cheap . i guess i forgot the old adage `` you get what you pay for '' , did n't i ? they worked `` okay '' when i first installed them . in a week , i got bad signals and the speakers did n't work properly . worse purchase i 've ever made ! ! do n't make the same mistake i did , please ! spend the extra money and get quality speakers
1	not so many words to talk about this item , but let me tell you that now i always use my rino turned on , in my car . baterie drain its no more cash pain ! **good things : -comes with a led ( small light ) that turns on with diferent colors ( red green yellow ) so you could know if your rino its turned on or of or disconected . -large cable ( for a car , you could use youre rino in the back seat even conected in the front of the car ) **bad things just a bad ending quality , it looks like a adapter of 2.99bucks , but i had owned it for more than a year and cero problems . pvpaco @ gmail.co
0	i purchased the cyberpad 8.5x11 digital notepad with the expectation that i would be able to digitize my sketches and notes i made at work . unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations . the first unit that i received did not function , the usb connection to the pad was defective ( the connector would not insert all the way hone ) . i returned it and received very promptly a new unit which at least functioned . as far as being functional that is another story . i proceed to try to use the it in either using the memory in the pad itself or using it directly connected to the computer . either way the unit produced images that were useless . the lines that look fine on the paper pad were incomplete or missing in the digital version . drawing a straight line was impossible even with the help of a straight edge . i let a friend try to use it and he had similar unsatifactory results . unless this performance is a function of this manufacturer 's design , i would say that this is one technology that is not ready for 'prime time '
1	i got this yoke to use with microsoft flight simulator . other people have said that the build quality is poor on this yoke , but what did you expect ? it 's just a computer game controller , it 's not meant to feel like an actual pilot 's yoke . if it were , it would probably be much , much more expensive ! yes , the plastic build makes it feel like just another joystick , but i 've had it for almost a year and have n't had any problems with it . also , i rarely need to reconfigure it , so there 's not an issue of `` wandering '' from the centre point . all in all , this yoke is fairly good and works well with flight simulator . it certainly makes you feel a little bit more like you 're a real pilot , but do n't expect to feel any g-forces or anything else like that
0	the case looks great and fits well , but it 's nearly impossible to remove . i had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time . i was afraid of hurting both the case and the ipod . in addition , it 's too wide in the case to dock in my logitech speaker system . i might have considered keeping it if i could have just snapped the case off for docking
0	it says it supports mac all over the package . however it does n't support , and can not be made to support mac files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files . for instance , when i drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named `` ilegally '' or uses a prohibited character . it says that it can not copy this file and gives you the prompt `` ok '' ? . `` ok '' is your only choice to click on . by clicking on `` ok '' the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder . how is that for compatibility ? how is that for delivering backup assurance ? i feel swindled . the product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak . mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box . it 's mac compatible as long as you adopt pc conventions in how you operate your mac . run mac owners ... ru
0	i have gone through 4 pairs in 4 months because they keep breaking , one thing after another . either one ear stops or they both stop in the same hour ! ! ! i would n't dare unless you can return them easy
1	this is a great tv . bought after looking around for months . receive hdtv signals , about a dozen without cable box . the number will continue to rise , but all of the main shows and programs are in hd . especially for sports fans almost every broadcast is in hd . true you will only get about 720p resolution from the broadcast over the air currently , but when the blue-ray hd movies are out in larger number and at a more reasonable price , this will become the standard . and this tv has 2 hdmi ports so you are ready to go . i have had another crt sharp which i have liked , and this product is no different . picture is amazing . some analog channels dont look that great , but i am at the point where where i would rather watch whatever is on an hd channel . note : i am in what is considered an upgraded cable section . the tv has the tuner to receive hd without the box as i have said , but i ca n't speak to sections that are not `` upgraded '' , so you may want to look into that . nice to receive without paying for extra equipment .
1	this product is good . i have n't seen any issues with this so far ...
0	i 'm not a system analyst , so i need really clear instructions for any new device . i bought this camera 1 year ago to use as a home security camera which i could view from the internet at my office . troubles i encountered : 1 . ) set up was impossible . i finally figured out that i had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free internet connection . i was n't willing to do this . 2 . ) i could view from the internet within my home network , but not from my office . 3 . ) had to convince one of my company 's it system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera 's system . took her 3 hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure -- which worked until i had to reset my router . 2 weeks of use in one year . 4 . ) i have never been able to have the camera send `` snap shots '' to my e-mail or ftp folder . d-link tech support confirmed that i was setting it up correctly ... but the feature does n't work . i was told by d-link tech support that i may need to disable my internet security program . no can do . 5 . ) d-link tech support may not have access to this product- they are not able to respond to my inquiries . they would send me answers- but not to the questions i asked ! 6 . ) the weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time i have tried to purchase- so i have not been able to install on the outside of my home . it therefore must be used inside which is not what i need . i could have paid & lt ; $ 80 for an indoor camera . every so often , when i have a few hours to burn , i drag it out and try to make the thing work . for the couple weeks it was viewable on the internet it provided a nice view of my home , but it was n't useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation .
1	i am so grateful to all the reviewers of this product for convincing me to give it a try . i have a six-year old hitachi dvd player , and i lost the remote . i could n't play anything without it , because the buttons on the player do n't allow me to select any tracks . the instructions on this remote are incredibly easy . it found my tv automatically , because it 's set for a sony tv by default . when i had to locate a code for my dvd player , i got worried -- none of the 3 hitachi dvd codes listed in the manual worked during the setup process . but there 's a search function to use in that situation , which allows you to scroll through all the codes in the chip 's library till one works . it found one within seconds , and i was up and running . i think i 'm going to buy this as a holiday gift for my siblings so they can get rid of all the remotes scattered around their living rooms
1	after reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my ipod . i had read a lot about how it interefered with the usb cable or the hold switch . but i could n't argue with the price . i must say that this product it actualy one of the best aftermarket ipod products i have puchased . it does exactly what it is supposed to do , protect my ipod . i have no trouble opperating any of the ipod 's buttons and i simply remove the case when i charge the unit . i have not found that it impairs the functionality of the ipod at all while keeping it securely around my neck . it is perfect for jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites . i find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion . ultimately it perfectly protects my ipod when i am out and about which is what it was designed to do . the reasons i gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little . and i whished they had mounted the ipod right side up like they did on the nano model . over all i am well please
1	also at an awesome price . i am going to buy another one just to keep in case the one i have needs to be replaced
0	we 've been through 2 generations of this phone and they suck . why we gave them a second chance i do n't know . the buttons that get used the most stop functioning after about a couple of years . then it 's off to the landfill . i am fed up with this trend in products to stop working after a limited amount of time . so long motorola
1	these are the only reliable disks i have found . i began a collection of friends on my dvd-rws . i have over 25 disks full so far and only had minimal problems with 1 or 2 disks . i rewatch all my favorite episodes , of which i have over 100 and have no problems . these are the best
1	this mount is nicely designed and well-made ; it fit the tv perfectly . our only criticism is that the screws provided for attaching it to the wall were of poor quality . the heads stripped out right away and it took a trip to the hardware store to get replacements
1	this watch is great because the countdown is so easy to use . whenever i need to remember to check the dryer or the stove , all i have to do is push one button to the number of minutes i want to wait . its the only watch i wear and i never take it off . i even swim with it on . the only reason i did n't give it five stars is because it is so plain . i wish casio would make it in a pretty color
0	product : mp3 players sansa m200 series sansa m240 we received your item : 11/03/2006 customer comments : 11/13/2006 07:51 am when will i get my repaired or replaced item . you have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status . please respond ( by the way , apple turns around ipod repairs in 1 day ! ) . 11/13 still waiting for an update on the m240 you received on 11/3
0	i do not do much printing , but the ink ran low after a very short time . it did not last as long as it normally does when i purchase it at an office supply store . i wondered if it had dried out
1	i 've had a ge and a sony ( cd543rm ) kitchen under counter units . i 've also tested a few others in stores . the sony 543 model is superior to any other unit out their and the sony 553 is superior to the sony 543 . the 553 is worth the extra bucks for the better sound quality and am/fm reception .
1	the mouse is perfect for games . i use it to play et and is great . the software provided by logitech is configurable in all ways
0	i bought this as a replacement for my stowaway when i replaced my palm m105 with an hp ipaq . the palm-stowaway combination was an excellent portable alternative to my laptop and i used in nearly every day . after my positive experience i expected my new ir keyboard to function the same way . what a dissapointment ! i can forgive the large size of the keyboard but there are several aspects of this keyboard that have made it intolerable to me . i found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation , i usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys . the little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the pda at all securely , even bumping the table can knock it off , and i have taken to using an elastic band to keep my ipaq in place . the `` mouse '' arrowpad is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys . finally the backlight does not stay on while using the keyboard and there is no backlight control on the keyboard ( unlike the stowaway ) . i will be replacing this keyboard with another after a much more careful search
0	these batteries did n't last at all . they worked ok in my remote control for my radio , but on everything else , the quality was either below-average or just horrid . my digital camera did n't even turn on with these . only recommended with low powered devices ; actually i 'd recommend a rayovac or an energizer rather than these . i know they 're only heavy duty batteries , but the quality is still below-average
0	pny memory is not very specific on its products , check and re-check that the specs . are what you need . pny is more a reseller of dubious memory brands of asiatic origin ( not that others are'nt , but ... ) , pay the extra and go for respected brands like viking and kingston , you ca n't go wrong . in the long term , it 's a better investment
1	i purchased the hawking hwu8dd on the recommendation of several other rvers . wifi signals at rv parks tend to be unreliable . until now , the built-in antenna on my laptop could `` see '' the signal at my park but could not access it . as soon as i installed the software and connected the hawking antenna via usb port , i immediately accessed my campground 's signal . the hawking antenna has solved a major problem for me .
1	i used it in brasil and had it developed . i was very happy with it . it was the very first time i 've used a digital camera
0	this thing is junk ! ! ! do n't waste your money . i am a computer professional and i had it working for about 5 minutes , then after powering it down and back up it never did work again ! if you buy one , go through the setup and if it does n't work immediately send it right back to amazon ! do n't waste your precious time trying to get a $ 70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time . finally , amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged . however , you should pay more attention to the bad reviews than the good ones . if the product is in fact good it wo n't have many bad reviews , or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional . however , look up all the bad reviews for this product . they should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product
1	this was a perfect fit for my 13 '' macbook . tried a couple cheaper ones , but was never satisfied , usually they were just a bad fit . this is by far the best , holds the computer in place and is light weight . it 's true you get what you pay for . one complaint , the extra pocket in front could be larger
1	these were double the price on another site ! my little girl loves these speakers ! she is using them with her pc . my only complaint and it 's my complaint and not my lil girl 's ... is that the sound quality is poor . obviously , not the speakers to get for real sound quality ... but kids love them
0	i have owned the dmr-es40v for over 6 months . it is a combo dvd/vcr unit . i have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit . the manual : it is imperative to have the manual . this machine is somewhat complicated , and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary . if everything is working correctly , you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it . it is overly time-consuming though , since the items do n't seem to logically flow . if you dig long and hard enough though , they are in there somewhere . the set-up : being somewhat experienced at setting-up a home theater , this was generally easy . the text and pictures were sufficient . searching through the function menu , i learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons . this is needlessly confusing . of course the auto clock set function is n't very accurate ( i have n't seen an accurate one yet ) . dvd playback : the general playback is pretty straight-forward . i really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my jvc progressive player ( which is 3 years older ) . finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult . a zoom feature is missing . many convenience features are not present . dvd recording : recording onto a dvd-ram disc is a dream compared to old fashioned vcr tapes . i really enjoy using them . a quirk -- you must have the unit in stand-by to record from the scheduler . this mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another ( on the same disc ) you must wait until the unit begins recording , then select the show to watch from the navigator . the uhf tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel 19 . other weak channels record but not 19 . this problem started about 6 months after initial set-up . there is an annoying bug with daylight savings time , and the newer extended time period . the panasonic web site suggests going into the set-up menu and unchecking the dst box ; thus removing the feature . if this did anything , it would allow you to set the clock manually . being without the automatic dst adjustment would not be annoying , but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at 7pm est . this ruins any tv scheduling you had set . this malady persisted until the date of the former dst spring-ahead arrived . several weeks of scheduling hell ! i requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised . no message , no number to call -- just a promise to call again when i was home . the vcr use : this feature is really buggy . you are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote ; but this only worked for a month or two . when a tv show is scheduled for recording the unit wo n't tape it if you merely insert a cassette . it does n't recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move -- either playing a little or fast forwarding/reversing . this is really annoying . last impression : the last movie ( last king of scotland ) i watched took over the machine . the remote control would not function , the disc would not stop , and the disc could not be ejected . it was necessary to unplug the unit , restart it , eject the disc , and totally reset all menu items -- which were randomly reset to various settings . worse some settings are no longer selectable . one other movie would not even play in the machine -- forcing me to use the trusty jvc unit . i must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what i read at this forum and other ones . these units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption . i recommend looking elsewhere .
0	i bought the kx-tg5571 and an extra handset after being so pleased with it 's predecessor kx-tg5471 . the 5571 handset does not have a flash button ! what you have to do instead is press the speakerphone button , wait for options to appear on the screen and then press a different button to access the flash function and there is no way to figure that out while looking at the handset . why
1	this keyboard is the best i 've ever used . the backlight is excellent and the keys just have that unique touch that just soothes your fingers . great and cool design . i recommend this keyboard all the way ! im typing on it right now by the way .
1	i am using this bag for school in which i need to carry 4 textbooks , a laptop ( 15.4 inch screen ) and a couple of notebooks . the pack has plenty of room for these items and still a couple of empty front pockets for additional gear . with all that weight , the pack is still comfortable to wear and has yet to bother my back
0	i hate this unit with a passion and i sell the things . its cheap , 299.99 at most retail place right now and that 's what you are getting . the one died in 24 hours , while plugged in and never turned back on . it also directed us to a road that was headed into the pacific ocean , there is no road across in the pacific last time i checked . it acquired satelites once and then never acquired them again . and good luck talking to customer service , both i talked to did n't speak english ... a dreadful unit , maybe tomtom could go work at walmar
0	while i have been very pleased with the performance of this product , configuration and setup was very easy , and even updates to the device are easy to do , it 's not reliable . it seems that every 3 or 4 days i lose connection to the internet . this is a 7 pc network , couple of servers . there really is n't huge bandwidth being used . but it is like it gets frozen - you ca n't ping it , you ca n't get to anything on the outside like the gateway or dns servers , and a simple power reset gets it working again . nothing is in the log , i have to believe this is some sort of firmware problem . i have checked all the ideas on netgear 's site without help . i know at least some of the time it freezes during the middle of the night , when no one is using it . could it be getting zapped from the outside somehow ? but it sure is not reliable , i ca n't recommend it
1	garmin has great ideas that suffer from the company they belong to . this option is a great thing to add to your 305 if you spin indoors or want to increase the accuracy of the gps . now if only the software was smart about how and when to use the sensor ...
1	i really enjoyed this product and the fact that its simple to use ! ! it clips nicely onto my laptop or i can take it off , it comes with a little protective case , and the lens slides in to keep it unexposed when you 're not using . i really like it and all its features as well
1	i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder , because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs . i bought this lens cleaner and -- voila ! -- the recorder is working again . super easy to use ( it 's simply a dvd that you insert into your machine , and the menus tell you what to do ) . highly recommended
0	i was not aware until purchasing , that the u3 smart drive by kingston would not run just any software but only certain programs therefore it is mostly useless to me . however i will use it as a general back up thumb drive
0	the product was shipped to me in moscow . after the first charge , i took it to university where it powered my notebook for two hours . upon returning home and recharging the device , i discover that it will not turn on anymore . i suspect the battery is charging as the led indicates this as it is connected to ac power . however , disconnecting it from any power source , it appears that the ac outlet and usb ports no longer function . the device gives no auditory signal or led message , so i do n't know if the built in inverter is out or something else is wrong with it . either way , i 'm left with a dead device that never supported charging from a 45 watt solar panel anyway . i strongly suggest getting the battery from tekkeon . sorry about the bad review , but i had my hopes for this device as well .
1	i purchased this gps back in april of 2006 and have been very happy with it since . it is not perfect , but you have to remember that this is not a dedicated street navigator or hicker gps , it 's a hybrid of the two and with that there are compromises . in the car : it is accurate and maps routes quickly 90 % of the time . the other 10 % of the time it either looses signal , has outdated maps ( my update is ordered and on it 's way as i type ) , or just slow processing for some reason . of this 10 % of the time i 'd say only 2 % of the time has this been an actual problem for me . the rest of the time i was able to simply guess what i needed to do next or it did n't matter at all . i have not found a perfect way of fixing the slow route calcuations , but the vast majority of the time this has n't been an issue . on foot : one of the features that sold me on this was the fact that it had a long lasting battery and it was waterproof . both qualities needed to be used for hiking . the only catch is you have to turn off the lock to roads , otherwise you will get some really confusing directions ! also it is difficult to program in destinations by coordinates as opposed to addresses , but it can be done ( put in and address then change everything including the coordinates in the confirmation screen before hitting route ! ) . on boat : have n't tested this as i do n't have a boat , and have n't purchased the water based maps . overall i 'm very happy with this and looking forward to the map update . i wish it was a little faster on route calculating and map drawing , and that it was easier to imput exact coordinate points . it 's still better than buying/lugging around 2 seperate gps systems to me
0	i put this paper on the wall in my office next to a picture printer on epson heavyweight matte paper and the glossy roll picture was yellow in a little over a month . i will never buy this paper again
0	why would anyone get this type of charger ? for about $ 40 , you can get an `` isupercharger '' that you can plug into the wall , plug into a car lighter , plug into a usb port , or run off of a 9 volt battery . with the 9 volt battery option , you can use your ipod all you want , even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping . it 's a small , all-in-one design . i do n't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when i take my ipod along .
1	i 'm very happy with the set . although not listed in the specs , it must have a qam tuner , because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable . i was thrilled when i made this discovery . watching football games in hd , without paying for digital cable , almost made me weep with happiness . the picture quality for analog channels is only so-so . i really wish the remote was illuminated . also , amazon took much longer to deliver the tv than was promised . other than these negatives , i 'm very happy
1	good product , great combination of screen protection along with a small flexable piece to cover the keypad .
1	the chip works just as advertised . i have had no problems with it , it was easily formatted to my kodak camera , and it stores a huge amount of pictures and video , either about 280 pictures or almost an hour of video . great product , i would recommend it for anyone looking for a lot of storage space for a good price
0	i bought this product to replace a previous hp all-in-one printer i had . this is by far the worst printer i have ever owned . it does not like photo paper , it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced . do yourself a favor - do n't buy this product ! ! !
1	bought this player for its size ( sports ) and its napster compatibility . updated the firmware after having a rocky start ; but things seem a little more stable now . also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods ( around 0 degrees celsius ) - odd behaviour - but mostly ok now that we are in the spring teens again . have n't found a case yet to protect from sweat . interface is what i expected - dead simple . no complaints for the price
1	the connectpro usb kvm switch costs a few dollars more but it really works the first time with no hassles . i 've been forced to use cheaper kvm switches at work and windows xp never seems to play nice with them . i use this one at home with two linux machines and a desktop and laptop running windows xp . the switch worked the first time i connected everything together and has worked glitch free ever since
0	this review is more about the hi-md concept in general than one particular player . the sound quality was excellent . the rest of the product and concept deserves to die in the marketplace . complaints : -the only thing that is n't proprietary is the headphone jack and the aa battery . beyond that , sony 's dual role as a content provider ( complete with nasty intellectual property lawyers ) and equipment manufacturer fatally compromises usuability of this line of players . no macintosh support is just the beginning . proprietary compression algorithms . weird and twisted upload/download rules . wrong choices made at every point of the prd process . -100x recording speed ? make that 4x on a good day . 100x speed is a specification that should attract the attention of elliot spitzer , if he only cared . -the players are flimsy . just walking with mine caused it to skip . and one hard fall to the floor and it stopped working entirely . sony will charge you to honor the warranty ( parts only -- no labor ) . by contrast apple replaced my daughter 's ipod no questions asked when it started developing hard disk hiccups . -trying to find hi-mds offers the thrill of the hunt , if you 're into that kind of thing . but their rarity suggests that sony is at best half-hearted about supporting this device . i used to be a loyal sony customer , but now believe they have gone almost irretrievably downhill . sleek designs do not compensate for disfunctional product management and shoddy manufacturing . in fact , i 'm planning an hd tv purchase next year and have sony far down on the list of possibilities . you can find better quality and value almost anywhere else these days . howard , are you listening
1	it works ! the antenna isnt junk either , i am getting almost all the digital stations from chicago 25 miles from sears tower with it inside my house sitting on my desk . i also get many digital channels that happen to be on the comcast analog cable in my area ( chicagoland ) . problem is that all the analog stations on my comcast cable are untuneable , so i cant watch those on my mac . its not supposed to be a cable tuning box , just digital stuff , so its fine , i just thought it did that as well . next thing to do is get a bigger/better antenna mounted outside and cancel cable ( as i only watch a couple stations anyways ) . eyetv - works . cytv with it - works great ! make sure you go and donate to that opensource project
0	it 's too small and signal is too weak . the life of battery is too short.not recomment to buy this . you can find some other model better quality
1	my criteria for my new printer purchase was : 1 . 11x17 2. individual inks 3. reliable printer company 4. easy installation/good customer service 5. price ( this was a bit pricey but the next step up was not a choice ) so far for my needs this has been a great printer so far . it does great quality prints for photos , school projects and more . i wanted to have more versatility to make posters , labels , photos , etc ... my last hp wide format printer ( 1200c ) lasted for over 5 years and i took it everywhere . i have only had this for a few motnhs but it has n't been a disappointment yet
1	this is a direct comparision between the linksys wusbf54g and trendnet 509ub . both perform as expected when used as a standalone hot spot detector . both perform as expected on windows xp . installation was quirky for both . after driver installation , inserting into usb slot it was n't recognized at all . fiddled around for awhile and it finally detected the device . had to disable the notebook 's builtin wireless before xp recognized the device . client software does not detect a device under windows vista ultimate rc2 . i assume this will be true for windows vista rtm too . inserting the device into a windows vista rc2 system often completely froze windows vista ( had to hold down power button for complete reboot ) . had to disable the notebook 's builtin wireless before vista recognized the device . appears that the trendnet and linksys devices are so similar that they must be made by the same oem or reference design . as expected , evaluation results are similar . 1 . both devices seem to have same sensitivity , similar to notebook 's internal wireless card . 2 . trendnet device does n't have windows xp signed drivers so an extra click during install is requried . also installing on new usb ports requires extra clicks . 3 . trendnet device supports 801.11a whereas linksys does not . 4 . trendnet device sometimes crashes vista ultimate rc2 . 5 . neither device 's software client works under vista ultimate rc2 . this is n't a deal breaker for me as they both work under vista ultimate rc2 networking as a usb wireless key . you just lose the client software feature . 6 . the linksys has a somewhat useful backlit lcd , trendnet does not . 7 . both devices work as standalone hotspot locators equal well . 8 . in hotspot mode , both devices show ssid , channel number , encryption mode , etc . conclusion : for xp , i recommend the trendnet so save the extra dollars . for vista , i recommend the linksys device as it never crashed vista ultimate rc2 whereas trendnet device was gave occasional freezes
0	when i purchased these batteries , i was very pleased , but that wore off after a couple of months . i do n't use my camera all that often , but when i do , i expect ther batteries to have some charge . i recharge them per instructions , and they do not hold a charge any longer.i know monster makes good products , but i am a little disappointed in this one
1	two-port print servers are the best and this product is great ! the d-link dp-300u was very easy to set up . every house should have a two port print server : one printer for an ink jet printer , one for a laser printer . thank you d-link for not killing this product . i hope you never do
1	i like this printer . there a few minor quarks , but it 's fast and the prints come out good . the one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight . if it 's lose it will start making bad prints . it takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out , tighten it and start printing again . i am also using this with the mac osx os . though the device says it will only work with pc and mentions something about the casio cw utility for use on a mac , but no where on the casio site could i find the mentioned utility . after some searching i cam e accross this : [ ... ] this allows the cw-100 to work fine on a mac . though i have never seen the pc software that comes with printer , i have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options . this is enough to get around , since you can make a jpg version of your label , put that in the print area and print away . the jpg can be what ever image/text you want . resolution is great too . i print at 300dpi . all in all , i found this to be a great purchase . i make music and do not have the money to send out to have my cds done . this print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost . great the diyer
0	i bought one of these modules for my dell 700m . installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or i get a blue screen . i contacted kingston and they said that this module has n't been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only ! i would n't recommend this memory for dell 700m users .
0	the only good thing about this product is its price ( i saw it being sold at $ 160 on some other site ) . there are several shortcomings though : - the greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu . there is no 'home location ' . also there are only two navigation options available - shortest time shortest distance . so if you are caught in a traffic jam for example , there is no 'detour ' function . also , you can not see the next few turns when you are navigating . hence you can not plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa . - the maps are probably very old . i used this device in nj , va mn . in every state , i faced problems multiple times , when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead it would not tell me to keep on left/right , or it would ask me take turns when there were none . - the unit was very slow in calculating routes ( i dont know how the sirf star iii chip helps ) . also it would freeze often i would need to reset it at critical junctions . - the viamichellin website is only dedicated to europe . when i went to register my product , i had to register it in viamichellin uk , since there was no option for us ! i dont think they have any support for the us models . - the pois are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range . i returned this product after trying to make it work for 2 months . it was great on part of amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy ( although they deducted 20 % restocking fee ) .
0	despite careful aiming , this has exactly , and i mean exactly , the same signal strength as my cheapie $ 6 airlink 7db omni , and is weaker than my homemade pirouline cantenna . probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap , but save your money if you 're expecting 15db performance
0	it 's a super idea , but i can not say it works well . getting a free station is a real challenge , even in the underdeveloped italy . and if you get one , but you are driving , within 5 minutes ( or 5 miles ) you lose the signal ... however the sound is perfect when you enter into a tunnel . is not good for cars , but works at home , connecting it to the radio . it needs to be improved
1	with my new lcd television , the hook-up was a snap and what a difference with the new hdmi compatible up-scale dvd i installed . the audio and visual difference for dvd and hd television programing is amazing with the cost at half the price at retail stores . very happy and highly recommended
1	just purchased earbuds at target . excellent sound quality , expected that much due to a previous of full headphones . even better once you find the right adjustable tip to fit your ear . well worth my 100 dollars , granted , i 've only had them 5 to 10 minutes , but i wo n't be returning them any time soon
1	this is a high quality , precision made piece . i 'm very particular about the construction of things that i buy and this peerless arm more than met my expectations . it was easy to attach to the back of my 32 '' lcd television and equally easy to mount to the wall . i read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble . not so here . everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen . all hardware is included along with clear , complete instructions . i 'd be surprised if you could find something better
0	i record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media , software etc.- i 'd been using ridata for some time w/ next to no coasters but figured i 'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around . big mistake . they skip , pixelate and freeze up . i have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies i 've done . were it a compatibility issue i could understand , but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media . i 'm going back to using my cheap disks ! the lesson here is : `` if it works , dont fix it !
0	i bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous $ 60 at circuit city out of dire necessity . i have never liked monster cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers . i opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection . at their usurious price point , i find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore i would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations . thanks to circuit city 's return policies , i was able to return this junk and get my money back . caveat emptor - cable buyers - spend your money wisely and stop the monster cable insanity
0	do n't waste your money on these things ! you can get a far better pair of headphones for comparable or less money spent . these things are nothing more than a marketing scheme to sell a look and fashion accessory . these headphones sound terrible and are very uncomfortable . total p.o.s. ! !
0	epson 's ink is great but very expensive ! i use a continuous flow system for my printer from mis . just google `` mis '' . ( midwest ink supply )
0	the best thing about the magellean 3000t is the large screen . sometimes this gadget works like a charm -- other times it just seems to pay no attention . actually , the touch screen function decides not to work . you can sit there and touch , rub , hammer ; to no avail . i got tired of the whole process and was ready to send it back to amazon . first , i called magellan 's help line ( the phone number was hard to find ) ; apparently you go to the diagonostic page and touch each touchscreen icon . if you hear a click , it 's okay . finally it works most of the time . damn bunch of trouble and frustration for a machine designed to reduce trouble and frustration .
0	the keyboard protector fits very well on my macbook , but in the end i got tired of how much slower my typing was when i used the protector . it claims it does n't slow down your typing speed at all , but it really does ; you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so . as i 'm typing this review now , i 'm not using my protector anymore . if you do n't mind how it slows down your typing , then go ahead and get it .
0	the headphones sound great -- no arguement there . however , i was removing the plastic tips ( which need to be changed every several months ) and the headphones broke . the company has only a one-year warranty so i was out-of-luck . again , i thought the sound was great , but for this price i would expect them to be more durable ... i was hardly touching them when they broke off . also , the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times
0	this drive has a great aesthetic design , but did not work out of the box when i received it . amazon delivered promptly as usual , but quality of this product is definitely lacking . look at the western digital ... that 's what i now have and have had no issues .
1	this is a great case . i have had no problems with it , and works very well . it 's also very `` sexy '' if you want to put it that way , and looks really cool . only trouble i have is that when i open it sometimes , it 'll make a click sound because 2 pieces touch , but its very minor and does no damage . it 's a great item ! however , if you intend to bang your laptop around a lot , i 'd recommend one of those soft outer cases too , because this is not intended to protect the hard drive etc . just protect it from scratches and smudges . i recommend it highly
0	my wife purchased an hp photosmart 8450 printer as a christmas present for me . i installed it and it worked perfectly for one week . then the colors started to change . photos had extreme amount of yellow in them , such as yellow faces and hands , no proper flesh tones . i call hp support and was told that my printer was out of warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured , not the purchase date . i was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that i had . i was given a case number , but when i called hp back stating my case number , they said that this was no longer a free call . i explained it was an extension of the first call , but they refused to work with me . i think hp warranty policy stinks , and would not purchase another hp product as long as this policy stands .
0	this little scanner is not worth the price . it 's got a very limited user interface making it very slow and aggravating to use . there is no possible way to directly input a specific frequency , large gaps in between the frequency ranges it 's programmed to receive , and very limited memory capabilities . the small display is hard to read unless you are directly in front of the device , looking from any angle and the backlit lcd display is unreadable . reception of this scanner is poor on all of it 's ( very limited ) bands , though can be improved with the use of an aftermarket antenna . the scanner is very prone to intermod from paging systems and other sources . the squelch is practically useless on this thing , it 's either on or off , it seems that any setting in between full and open are pretty close to full , as it takes fairly strong signals to break the squelch even when it 's set just above the static level on any empty frequency . the sound quality from the built-in speaker is tinny and shallow sounding , but at least there is a jack for an external speaker . on the bright side , the chassis is well built and strong , the buttons have a decent feel , not to light nor too stiff . the knobs turn with ease , but will not change their settings due to road vibration , they stay put where you set them at . the fit and finish of the scanner is actually quite good overall , but it 's not enough to make up for it 's lacking feature set and poor performance
1	i 've had my cobra 29 for over five years now . it 's been in four different trucks , and traveled over 500,000 miles with me . once i added two wilson antennas and a power mic , i can get out over four miles on a good night . my personal record is a line of sight 130 miles from a mountainside . i love it . i was thinking of getting a galaxy , but why ? i have a great radio here
1	by far this is the best printer i 've had i been buying epson for many years if you like your pictures to have that pro photo look this the printer to own.the price is great delivery was very quick rec 'd it next day.when you buy epson you wo n't back .
1	i have a 40 '' samsung lcd and wanted an arm that would both extend and also be able to hold 50 lbs or so . this arm feels solid and does the job ; the tv has n't fallen yet . one thing to be sure of is to check the size adapter plate you will need to connect the arm to your tv . my arm came with a 200 x 100 , but i needed a 200 x 200 plate and had to order it separately . i would recommend this arm
1	must say that the item was better than i expected . thanks to the seller and will buy again ! ! !
1	always something that might come in handy my last remote quit working after a year
1	this is my second projector - i used an nec for the last four years , but that died on me recently . and , boy , am i glad it died - i am amazed by the quality of the ax100u - the pictures and colors almost jump off the screen at you . also , the oft mentioned ldc projector 'screen door ' effect is virtually non-existant - you have to stand almost next to the screen to notice it . i believe panny used some smoothening technology to achieve it . the contrast is also truely outstanding for an lcd projector - at par with dlp systesm , but without the headaches of the rainbow effect . couple of pointers which might be helpful to other users . when i first started using the projector with my dvd player i was getting some wavy curls ( not too visible , but still there ) that seemed to flow across the screeen . however , after about 4-5 hours of use , they have disappeared - so if any of you see those wavy curls , just give it a few hours and hopefully yours will disappear as well . secondly , unlike my old nec i was getting a flickering shimmer when using my hd box from my cable company . the shimmer was just at the edge of teh picture . there is an easy fix for this . go to options , overscan , and you can actually crop the edge of the image and not see it any more ... voila - no flickers and an incredible picture . be aware that this is big , bulky projector compared to some others out there . definately not a portable one - you do n't want to be lugging it home from work after presentations to see home pictures . this was designed as a dedicated home theater projector , not a portable presentation device . i highly recommend this projector - you 've got to see the picture to believe it - i did n't think it was possible at this price range .
0	please do n't be fooled by it 's inexpensiveness . i am a victim of it . i already bought this card and within 2 weeks i started getting read and write errors . i formatted the card and it now has 2 mb of bad sectors . unlike the other reviewer i did had 2 gb to begin with . but i think it is bad quality product and thats why it is dearth cheap . it is not at all reliable . now i am contacting their customerservice to replace this card for me
0	as the other reviewer found out , these cards ca n't be formatted to work with sd audio . total waste of money
0	this wireless speaker system failed to work right out of the box . however ; i had not problem with the return , which included return postage . i will purchase from amazon again
1	my daughter is very happy with the product . she not only got the mp3 player she wanted , she also got her favorite color `` pink '' . thought we got a great deal and it has been working wonderfully . infact , my son is now jealous that his younger sister has a better mp3 player than he has
1	this wall mount works and hold 's great . i used it for an olevia 542i lcd flat panel and have had no problems . the instructions are not all that clear , but it is not hard to figure out how to instal
0	hard to believe this product is still being sold when it 's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods . also the claims of good design i feel are overstated . finally the speakers are weak and sound like it wo n't be long until they 're shaking , this may influence what music you 'll end up playing through the system . all said , though , i 'd be happy with it for the price if only they 'd update it to fully handle my ipod
0	i have been a fan of western digital hard drives for many years , but that ended with this product . i purchased an essential edition 250gb drive for my daughter as a christmas gift , by new years it was doa . giving wd the benefit of the doubt , i exchanged it for an identical replacement . this one made it until early march . three clicks and it turns off . wd says there is nothing i can do but return it under a rma . they can do nothing about the lost data . so much for using this drive for backing up important files . i 've have had at least a dozen wd drives over the years and never had a failure , they just became obsolete because of their size . this produce however ... .stay away
0	despite the claim that both units take aa batteries , the unit we recieved takes 9v batteries . that is somewhat annoying because one of the reasons we bought this model was because of the aa battery usage as advertised . will review performance when we 've had a chance to use it .
1	i like to a lot this product , and i work very well and also has a low price , to obtain this is a good offer for who buys it
1	as of 2007 most of the bugs mentioned in the other reviews are fixed . the ipod fits snug as a bug in my unit and it even charges it.youu can even find this as low as $ 140 or chaper . im not sure why the bad reviews.this is a wonderful dvd player and the newer one i got even plays your ipod through your tv if you want..older versions did not allow this . you should buy this.the video quality isnt great , but good , thats why i gave it four stars instead of five it is bulky but you need room for the ipod to plug in . the only bad side is no ipod naviation from the menu . you must use the ipod itself..but being able to play your ipod and dvd through any tv with rca jacks ( audio/video ) is great..i can now backup my purchased ipod items to dvd since i have an eyetv250 which allows you to use your computer as a tv . the eyetv has rca jacks on the device which allows me to record it to my harddrive which i then use toast to burn my dvd..all in all its completely worth it . even as a stand alone dvd player it 's great..never had the first proble
0	overall this item works as expected , but requires to be reset ( i.e . cycle the power ) once every 24-48 hours . i will be replacing it with another model
1	i 've used allot of different adapters but this one is got to be the best ever . the linksys wpc54gx4 work with all routers , but when you pair it up with the linksys wrt54gx4 router look out , my range increased and i 'm getting upwards of 250mb of speed , setup is also a breeze
0	i have a mouse intensive job with dual screens working on digitizing maps . unlike the reviewers before me i have a normal size hand . over the years i have developed a slight pain on the top of my wrist . my favorite mouse so far has been a microsoft wireless mouse similar to the 5000 design but with the fake leather on the palm , which is no longer available . i saw this `` ergonomic '' natural mouse advertised on microsoft 's website six months ago and purchased one the second it became available . the mouse caused instant pain in my wrist . i tried using the mouse for a week in different positions thinking i just had to get used to the mouse . my wrist pain just got worse . after a week the pain in my wrist was so bad i was n't sure it would ever go away . not only did i have pain while using it but for days after stopping . although i have a mild pain in the top of my wrist from normal mousing this mouse caused pain in a different location at the base of my thumb . i returned the mouse and returned to my old mouse .
1	ordered 2 items ... ideastream cd storage boxes and fellows cd sleeves . which is obviously 2 different manufacturers . when ordering , i clicked on a combination option to order both . needed 10 of each ... the `` 10 '' only tranferred to 1 item , not both . was not noticed until transaction completed and received a verification . called customer service and found out there were two `` customer services '' to deal with . could not change the order even though it was less than 5 minutes when i first called . customer service is obviouly not in the us ... had a communication problem and could not get a `` supervisor '' as no one was available for 2 hours . ended up paying for 2 freight charges because we had to place a 2nd order to get the quantity needed . could not get any help ... will look elsewhere before we place another order of that type . items were exactly what was needed . amazon customer service was non-existant
1	makes plane flights so much more enjoyable and costs hundreds less than other brands . only thing that could make it better is passive noise reduction but then it would be bulkier
1	this cable has worked fine for me with no problems . i 'm using it to connect an inexpensive keyboard to a laptop
1	i do n't bother charging my zune from the computer any more . this is the only way to go
0	i 've owned two of these now . the screen 's great and i love the wireless headphones -- terrific for very small children . our 2-year-old drove to new mexico and back ( well , we drove and he watched videos ) with this thing . unfortunately , both units broke after less than a year of use . the first one just stopped working ( with a dvd permanently trapped inside ) . the second one just developed an intermittent white-out and screen noise that 's happening once a minute now . so i am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one . all of these little players seem to have reliability problems , so my main advice to everybody is buy the extended warranty and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles -- you will be cashing it in
1	i would give a high recommendation for this tv . it is the perfect size for a bedroom especially if you 're not looking to overwhelm the room but you just want something to watch a late night movie , the morning or evening news , or the late shows in high def . dvd player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the tv at all . the picture is outstanding and is n't that what really matters in the end ? ? ! ! the only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation - the tv has an auto-on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a channel on which to tune the tv once it goes on . it you are use the hdmi as i am to get signal from your cable box , you must have the tv input mode set to hdmi but you ca n't set the auto-on to the hdmi input ( it must be a channel number ) . the engineers just did n't think that one through all the way . oh well , still a great tv
1	this is a perfect mp3 player . i had the 40gb model before this and needed a bit of extra room . you ca n't ask for anything more than this . it does everything an mp3 player should , and more ( podcasts , videos , photos ) . i bought the 60 a couple of weeks before the 80 was released at the same price . bad timing on my behalf..
0	i got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term , risky cells . it could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but i 'm not willing to chance it again
1	i thought when i up graded to the plasma things could n't get any better i was wrong the wireless is the cherry on top i love this thin
1	when i first got this mp3 and opened up the box i was surprised how small it is . about the size of a piece of chewing gum . i installed the program via the included cd and it worked right away with no problem what so ever . this held all the music i had on my lap top with lots of room to spare . the program is easy to use and downloading music to the player is fast and easy . the sound is outstanding with the ear-bud headphones that are included . the fm works well and the display is back-light and very easy to read . all of the players options are user friendly and do not require a lot of skill to use . this is one piece of electronics that will not drive you mad with hard to use software or directions . as an added bonus they included batteries . this is one of my favorite gadgets and i would recommend the 1 gig for any user . it is not expensive at all and really who needs more music than this holds
1	my wife 's grandmother ( the person this was bought for ) loves this phone ... '' it 's easy to use with large buttons friendly `` controls '' . i loved the price ease of setup ... answering machine is flawless the handset gets great reception . perfect all around :
1	for the price , these speakers are well worth the cost . of course , in my opinion , anything that dosnt say `` creative '' on it is usually worth the price . not a lot of bass , but with the bass boost , these speakers sound real nice . only bad thing i 'll say is that m-audio 's tech department is really bad . emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for vista , still no answer . ( my inquiry was about a different m-audio product )
1	the initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures . when i went surfing for another flash card with some depth , amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent .
1	this phone installed easily , has good sound , caller id is visible . hooks securely . that 's about all we wanted
1	i 'm so happy with these speakers . for the price , the sound is utterly amazing . i have a good moderately priced system , and these speakers really make it special . no one can believe the crystal highs or the big bass coming from such humble-looking speakers
0	range is very weak probably less than half a mile . do n't waste your money
0	my cyberhome portable dvd player worked for all of 1 day . it is unable to play dvds or cds of any type . also , if you charge the battery according to manufacturer specs , it will completely drain out within 24 hours . i attempted to get service from cyberhome to no avail even though product is still under warranty . their support number is unreachable as is their support email address . attempts to locate the company via the web were unsuccessful . this would have been a great product at a great price if only it had worked . purchase at you own risk . check out the manufacturer web site . you have been warned
0	i called garmin tech support yesterday ( 10/17 ) , did wait about 15 minutes to speak to someone . i called in the morning so it was n't a long wait . since my nuvi is still under warranty ( 1 year warranty ) i requested a rma for a replacement suction cup mount . the tech asked how it had failed -- mine also had melted to the windshield so i had to rip it off -- and responded like he was very familiar with the problem . he also mentioned the rubber material of the original design was defective and that they had a new rubber material design and would send me a new one . i did n't have to pay for it and should get here in 7-10 days
1	very nice player . hdmi works perfectly and the 6 disc changer is handy . blue light lets you see the disc 's and looks very cool . 1080i with upscaling on all my dvds .
0	first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony , but i have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman . i purchased one in march 2006 and returned it september 2006 , as i had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke . it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open , not to mention the headphones always pull out . the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable . save your self the hassel ! ! ! ! !
1	i recently purchased this as a replacement for my monster cable . i must say that i am quite impressed . this is the best fm transmitter i have encountered . i live in seattle . there is a fairly saturated fm dial , and the unique topography of the surrounding area has a tendency to deflect certain signals . that said , i only have minor problems with interference , the most common of which is moderate distortion in the upper ranges . functionality is pretty much seamless in my car . i drive a 2003 ford focus . the 12v power jack is position to the left of my in dash cd changer , so accessibility is not an issue . if anyone is in the market for an fm transmitter for their ipod , i highly recommend this one . `` that 'll do , pig . that 'll do .
1	after going through nearly 6 mouses ( including several of the microsoft mouses ) , i settled on this because its round contuour shape and large effective button area that extend very far back . it also works with my kvm switch , which is a key consideration . the buttons are a bit stiff but i expect them to `` loosen '' up a bit after some use . i highly recommend this mouse
0	i spent two days tried to have it formatted by my powerbook g4 and set up a wireless network to replace my microsoft wireless router . no luck . it is on the shelf ever since . people at the genius bar in local apple store may be able to help but it is too much troubel . to set up other routers with a pc you can easily hire some one to set it up for you at your home for a couple of hundred dollars . not apple . if you do n't have time do n't buy this product .
0	installation : express install is over 200mb , full install about 650mb ! ! ! it requires you to upgrade to internet explorer 6 to continue installation ( how it this related to printer installation , and what if i do n't use internet explorer - i do not ) . install takes forever , is memory hog , then tries to sign you up for some services . i used to like hp printers . i 'm completely disappointed with the software to the point that i would rather have other printer than deal with this type of software .
1	bought it for my wife and she loves it . it keeps track of where you were and restarts from there . the display is small ( no fancy menus like ipod ) but works well . sound is excellent . be sure to install the drivers and software . the software is small , simple and easy to use - or you can just copy/paste files onto it . if you do n't install the drivers it only works at usb 1.1 speeds and takes a lot longer to load songs . with drivers you get full 2.0 speeds
1	i travel overseas a lot for my job . this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your `` normal '' plugs for operating four devices . most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money ( wires , cables , etc . ) but this gizmo rocks
1	the cs70 is an excellent product , easy to setup and use and good battery life
0	but 20 dollars more and hideous . i have a platinum intuos2 tablet ( a high school graduation present from 2004 ) , and when i broke the pen , i ordered the regular intuos2 pen due to it 's being slightly cheaper on wacom 's site . here , the platinum is 20 dollars more ( and in my opinion , much uglier ) . i recommend buying the classic intuos2 pen
1	replaced my old 22 '' cinema display that was 5 years old . what a difference . clear screen , flawless finish , solid and adjustable stand . easy hook-up , it took longer to clean the dust off my computer than hook this up !
0	i purchased the 8gb creative zen v plus player during the first week in february . today , march 6th , i am returning it and this is why : the package arrived from amazon . i loaded up the software on my computer , then hooked up the player through the usb cord . i let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state . then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player . so after the music was loaded , i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music . the sound quality was good , the player is easy to navigate in the menus , etc ... the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player . i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there . so i plugged the player back into the usb cord , and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer . the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player . i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there . then i accessed through the computer just fine . all my songs , all 4,500 of them , are in mp3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs i ripped from cd 's . the player just would n't read about half my songs . there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize . i would load an entire album of 15 songs and i could only play 6 or 7 tracks . this happened with my entire music collection . so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update . it did not solve the problem . i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my 3 year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine . i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service . it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why . they have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company i have ever spoke with . after three calls , never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language , more like a 3rd or 4th language , i arrived nowhere . they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem . no email ever came , checked the junk folder and every other possible place . so i tried a fourth call . this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand , saying `` i ca n't believe you americans '' and then mumbled something in another language . i asked for a supervisor . he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days . then he hung up . i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature . they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way . so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also do n't plan on buying anything from creative again . by the way , after all this , the problem never was fixed . also , when doing research on this product , i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files . this is not true . this player will not play any files without being converted first . i took an avi video that was 100mb and it converted it into a 1.2gb file . the format they use is absolutely a waste of space . if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format , it will end up taking the entire 8gb of space if not more . i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie . i was wrong , the movie took up 7.1gb after being converted . i would not recommend this product to anyone . as much as i do n't like the ipod , i would recommend it over the zen v plus because : 1 . it plays all my music 2 . they have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers . i hope this helps anyone looking at this player . jeff
1	it works very well . it 's nice to be able to listen to cd 's in my car without getting a whole new stereo system installed . my only problem is that the cd player will turn off every once in a while when the power cord is bent . this happens rarely , but it 's enough to be a little annoying . other than that , it 's a very nice product . no skipping , easy to use and a fair price
0	for the first few weeks it worked fine , however , it started skipping and stopping dvds after two months . i called customer service on 85th days after original purchase date and been told to send the unit for replacement since it was still under warranty , no case number was given at the time . the unit was shipped via ups and received on 92nd days from the purchase date , and they charged $ 50 for warranty service since it was received two days after warranty expired . i called customer service again and the representative declined waiving charges because i do n't have case number issued within warranty period . in addition , please keep in mind that their service fee includes returning handling and shipping fees as well . next place for my dvd player ? trashcan *sigh* go buy another brand with 1 year warranty unless you purchase extended warranty along with this unit . pros : cheap dual screen comes with gaming pad detachable screens which is very easy to use . cons : sub lcd screen is n't sharp as main , i thought it was defective for the first time . all the games are outdate
1	i 've had canon printers using this cartridge for more than a year and wo n't settle for any of those knock-offs . yeah , they 're often much cheaper , but this is one area where you get what you pay for . brand x fades and does not perform as well in the inkjet system . this has been confirmed in independent lab tests in a leading pc magazine . i have had to install and remove countless cartridges and never spilled a drop . the pop-in , pop-out design could n't be easier
1	i bought these for some sony surround sound speakers , although i was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is ( essentially ) plastic . however , they turned out to be very sturdy , and easy to install . i also have to commend the mannufacturer for including very detailed instructions as well as a large selection of mounting hardware . well worth the price
1	this radar/laser detector is very good detects the police radar and the best is do not false signals
0	when you buy a name like sony , you expect to get decent stuff . this dvd recorder failed miserably . no s-video inputs in the rear so you have to run s-video to the front panel ( which my 2 year old loved to unplug ) . nice editing features if you have the time . unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done ( who knows if i will get it back ) . i replaced it with a lite-on dvd recorder ( at less than half the price ) and am very happy with it
1	when we initially pulled this out the box , i was excited becaue it was crafted so well ! real wood and excellent craftsmanship - however - the sound absolutely sucks ! it sounds like elmo 's toy piano , or even worse . i thought it was just the fact that the piano was sitting flat on the floor ( i had n't installed the legs yet ) , and the sound was just off . by the time i got everything assembled , the disappointment settled in even deeper . this piano was not worth the price i paid for it - by any stretch of the imagination . i realize this is a toy and not an instrument ; but again , for the money , you 'd expect a better sounding product . an added note : my daughter loves banging on it
1	i 'm very happy with this device . the suction cup holds very securly . i would advise anyone who buys a satellite receiver to skip the adhesive mounting bracket that comes with it , it will come un-stuck eventually . just get one of these brackets and mount the radio right in the first place
1	i lost my monster cable brand m to m cable for my ipod and looked for a different kind and ran across this one at half the price ... plugged everything in and it works super-good sound quality and saved some bucks . hard to find these cables , so i highly recommend it
0	no free lunch you get what you pay for ... is that the verdict on this product ? well , the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it . i need disc binders and the case logic brand , while being the original , is pricey . low cost alternatives are needed , but not at the expense of quality and tco ( total cost of ownership ) . but the flap about poor customer service ( rebates ) and poor quality ( zippers and sleeve binding ) is enough to give me pause ... .. so , if someone from xtreme 's management is paying attention ... .fix it or be content to lose business . price is n't everything to everyone in the markt for your product..
1	unlike most tech gadgets that are a little outdated , this product stands in nearly every aspect . the sleek , supreme design by f.a . porsche makes this product appearance timeless , and its preformance is outstanding , more effective in this model than its smaller , slower ( 80gb , 120 gb ) counterparts . the autostart is a little slow for me ( its the usb model , not firewire , remeber ) , but is a totally acceptable feature for the price , design performance cost-benefit equilibrium . excellent purchase
1	needed the adapter to charge my shuffle , since the ac adapter i have is one of those older apple ones with the firewire connector . suits my needs perfectly . no experience with any sound docks , however , so i ca n't comment on the performance flaws other people have brought up
0	the ends are comming off this cable does n't meet the normal belkin standards
0	i bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied - until last week when it stopped functioning altogether . i really expected a better product and durability from microsoft . i 've since bought a logitech vx revolution cordless laser mouse for notebooks and love it .
1	i just got mine from amazon ( after a lengthly delay ) . it is an awesome memory card . it comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras . i tested it on the camera and it worked great . the real test was the compatibility with the sony psp . no issues there . the card worked flawlessly . i 've already used up 600 mb ... ..its a must buy ! plus , at $ 99.99 , its much less than other retailers . btw , i ordered it at $ 104.99 , then contacted amazon about the price drop . they credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one-day shipping at no charge because of the delay . overall great service too .
1	i purchased the casio keyboard for my grand-daughter 's 4th birthday . she really enjoyed playing it . as a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day . it is the perfect size for a small child . she sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms . the only thing that was n't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing , but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it
0	the item is good , the sound is decent but i tought than a refurbished item was an item that you can hardly say it 's used . the speakers i got did not look good at all . scrached and dirty , you can see it was used for a very long time . no too happy about this item
0	this is my third asus mother board . all were great , manual was excellent and email support was swift . now all of these reasons to buy asus are missing . manual provides no assistance , zero . faq online , nothing . email for assistance , no reply . asus user forum , no help . got all accomplished without assistance . went to register ... . and could n't get that done , so i gave up on it . i 've wasted 38 hours on account of missing basic information support . my previous motherboards ( asus ) were well documented with excellent definitions of bios options , etc . everything went smoothly . i expected the same excellent support from asus today , i did n't get it . no more asus . be ware
1	i purchased this as an extra phone so i could access both phone lines on the second floor of my house . well-built with hold and 3-way conferencing features , sound quality is good and it has selectable ring levels for each line . powered from the phone line , no external power is used . one drawback : the line indicator does n't light when the line is being used by other phones in the house .
0	have used many types of dvd-r . this the only one i have found that did n't have a record speed encoded in it and was unusable . tried different locations on the spindle and the same results . would have been a good buy if they worked . gave it only one star because there was no 1/2 star
1	it was easy to set up and use . our remote was bad out of the box but panasonic sent us a replacement . we were able to record tv programs right away and then transferred our old vhs over to dvd . it took a long time to transfer but it was worth watching the vhs tapes again to bring back memories .
0	i ordered this for christmas from a marketplace seller . it was defective and assumed i would have to deal directly with philips to get a replacement . after seven weeks , i still do not have a replacement from them ; their customer service people keep telling me 10-15 days , and i have no recourse . i also thought the unit was complicated to use and would gladly obtain a refund if i could , or even get the unit . i would not recommend buying this or any other philips product to anyone . their customer service is the worst i 've ever dealt with . i also had to pay the shipping to return their defective dvd player
1	i bought this in lieu of the fuji counterpart which was out of stock in amazon . since the fuji finepix e900 runs on aa batteries and its ac powercord/supply is an option one has to buy , this reader is a cheap , quick and even more portable alternative for downloading pix to my mac
1	i did a bit of internet research for this , and a site devoted to luggage was raving about this . what can i say ? they were right , and it is just an unbelievable value . i love it . i got it because i do alot of walking for my commute , had started a class that required me to do alot more to get there and the book was massive . my back was already complaining about what i was carrying around on a daily basis . i ordered it and it arrived in 2 days , my back was and is so grateful . it is tough ! the sidewalks are n't in the best shape , and i 'm always pulling it up and down over curbs and had a couple of days of ice and snow , and the wheels are scuffed up but still no worse for wear ( although the little pad on the bottom for cushioning your hip if you wear it over your shoulder fell off , but why would i want to carry it like that anyway ) . very well designed , with plenty of compartments , and padded computer sleeve is removeable . it maneuvers well , is light with a comfortable handle and strap ( gel-like ) . i can grab it by the handle and walk up the metro stairs with no problem . a quality case for a great price
0	the software is terrible , slow and glitchy . i have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player . the operators manual is just under 100 pages , so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls . granted , the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive -- assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual .
1	this product has good and bad points . i listed some below : good -- -- -- -- - cheaper than apple ( $ 5 as compared to $ 30 ) works great small convienient bad -- -- -- -- - cheap ( might not hold up long term ) no warranty coverage for your ipod is something goes wrong has to be plugged in upside down ( for me anyway ... ) overall , i 'm glad i bought this instead of apple 's version . the main factor for me was price , but if you have the money , get the apple charger , simply because you 'll be covered by warranty that way
1	note : this product will only work on walls with wood studs . no metal studs . see the sanus website for installation manual and more details
0	just received radio yesterday , and am returning radio today ! pluses ... . adequate lcd display and good illumination while on ac adapter . good thumbwheel tuning in 1 khz increments . adequate speaker fidelity for small radio . however , the volume slew buttons have set `` numbered '' volume levels , and between settings of 5-6 , there is a big noticeable increase in volume ( not good ) , and while tuning shortwave bands , every approx 100khz increment , there appears to be a `` null '' area , where signal meter reads a signal received , but quiet speaker . also , on fm , if hands are near the radio , the signal breaks up ( for weaker signals , not strong ones ) , and compared to my grundig 400-pe , which i feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome , the eton e-5 seems worse still ! ! ! i am returning this today , and obtaining the sony 7600gr instead . eton e-5 , not bad , but certainly not worth 3 stars or above , especially , if comparing it to another similar size radio , and then comparing it to my sony 2010 .
1	when i bought these i was mainly looking for a long enough cord to be able to put my mp3 player in my pocket . not only is the cord legnth great but so is the sound . i did n't expect the sound quality to be so good in such an inexpensive product . the cord also has a built in volume control so i do n't have to dig the player out of my pocket to adjust the volume . the buds are quite comfortable , i have worn them for hours at a time with no problem . i love these
1	this printer does an excellent job . the colors are vivid and the clarity is very crisp . the only negative is you are restricted to the canon paper with end tabs . good value for a compact snap shot printer
0	i 've found the befsx41 ( v2.0 ) to be very problematic . with firmware version 1.50.18 , some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes , bringing down the entire net . with the newer firmware version 1.52.10 it fixes this problem , but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server ( passthru tcp port 80 ) , making the router totally unusable . tech support was friendly and helpful , and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1.50.18 for our websites , and upgrade each time to 1.52.10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking . so now we upgrade/downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week , and each time we do it brings down our net . i 've also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands . you can not assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its mac address . instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips . also , it appears that you can not map two different external ports to the same internal port number , even though they map to two different computers . this makes it impossible , for example , to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time
1	this cable was just what i needed to connect my stereo to my computer 's sound card across the room . i 've been converting old lps to digital files , and having a well-built cable probably improved the sound quality considerably . amazon 's price was unbeatable too
1	how often are you on the way to work or to a meeting and you end up getting stuck in the traffic jam of the century . nobody is moving and you can tell it 's going to be a while . it would make sense to brush up on those reports or your presentation while you 're stuck , but who wants to eat up the battery on their laptop right before a presentation ? this inverter allows you to plug in your laptop into your car - just like a wall outlet - no worries , work off your car 's alternator instead of your battery and catch all your typos before you get to your appointment
1	it pairs quickly with laptops bluetooth phones . holds the gps module firmly and matches the look perfectly . the only gripe i have is it does n't have an anti-slip surface so that i can throw it on the dashboard and not worry about it falling off . the battery lasts forever . i remember using it for 6 continous hors before switching off ... mind you switching off because i had arrived at my destination
1	this is a very nice tv for the money . great picture and with the built in dvd player that plays cd 's i was able to remove a big old crt tv , dvd player and stereo from the bedroom . i 'm happy with my choice
0	this cartridge does not fit my hp 648c as advertised . the color cartridge that accompanied it did , however
1	a nice little radio . good sound for the price . i like the easy-to-read station indicator .
1	this antenna is one of the best indoor uhf antennas , but is designed for uhf only . many cities use both uhf vhf for digital tv . to see if uhf vhf are used in your area , enter your address at www.antennaweb.org then , look at the digtal channel frequency assignments column . if any channels are 2 thru 13 , this antenna is not for you . do not buy any knockoff antennas sold by terk . they are mostly junk .
1	look , for a bargain-basement product , what do you expect ? first , you expect it to work , and i can confirm it definitely does work . when plugged in to usb , it signals xp correctly . the driver software is very tolerant . you can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device . so installation is a 5 minute process . next comes the capture and initial encoding . well , the software is a bit lame as far as features and gui . typical . but it absolutely saves in mpeg2 / dvd format just as you 'd need it to for making dvds of all your dish network or ps2 or vhs content . the frame rate is full on 30 fps . it takes an svideo or standard rca video signal . both are just fine in quality . the resolutions are not that great ... but its passable for dvd when you crank it up . do n't think you can encode some blu-ray quality mpeg with this though . as far as the overall durability of the product , i 've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight . it gets hot , but its never so much as flickered or needed reset . bottom line ? this thing is like a kids toy- its cheesy but tough as nails . get it for your first analog signal mpeg encoder . its a good value .
1	i love this item . we bought 2 cases for our sons before we left for vacation . it can hang from the seats but they just held them on their lap or layed it on the couch in the van . the boys arranged everything in the case so the battery even fits in it . i was glad about that . i 'd recommend this item .
1	i have had this tv since the weekend before the superbowl . the superbowl and any nascar race looks incredible . many reviews i read ( everyone on here ) which had totaled around 109 . whew ! i got ta tell ya though , this tv replaced a 51 '' sony hdtv . the sound was awesome . when i turned on this new samsung i was very disappointed . my wife almost made me send it back because of it . i made some adjustments which did make it sound a little better but nowhere near the sony . i went to a big box store and they told me it was because these companies expect that you will hook it up through a surround system and not use the tv sound . { shrug } i do for movies but not for regular tv . overall it is a very nice tv especially for the $ $
1	i could n't believe how lightweight this monitor is , and how easy it was to connect to my computer . it is one of the best investments i have made this year . what a difference the lcd screen makes for my vision . its wonderful . i highly recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for something easy to connect and have excellent quality as well . it is the perfect monitor for me
1	i 've had my e-10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it 's performance . my interests in radio pretty much revolve around a.m. ( or medium wave ) dx'ing and shortwave listening . it 's performance on a.m. is on a par with the highly regarded kaito ka-1103 which i received for christmas this year . shortwave performance is very close , however , the kaito is superior in this area ( and features ssb tuning as well ) f.m. ? the e-10 is well above average but falls short of the kaito ka-1103 . i 've yet to see a radio that can equal the kaitos performance in this area , but the e-10 is closer than most.build quality , ergonomics , and appearance are second to none and better than most . the slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a `` top of the line '' portable multi band receiver even though it 's moderately priced.it 's lcd digital display is one of the largest and nicest i 've seen , very easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight . other amenities such as 500 plus memories,12/24 hour clock , i.f . shift and antennae trim which are both useful in shortwave reception , local/dx switch and the internal battery charger for nicad or nimh batteries all add up to make this a radio i 'm glad i purchased and often recommend to those needing a radio of this type.even the accessories included with this radio such as the carrying satchel , earbuds , and reel-up shortwave antennae are top notch ! now , if you 're wondering why , after all this praise i only gave it a four star rating , and not a five it 's because eton did not provide ssb tuning capability on this receiver . and it 's a shame because it 's shortwave performance is good enough to utilize it . in my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio . hence they only `` hit a triple '' ( which is way more exciting nonetheless , i 'm a baseball nut too ) and not a home run
1	we installed this external hd on a dell computer . as most dell customers will attest to , any time you talk to one of their representatives , they 'll deny compatability with anything other than a dell product . well , i have upgraded the video card , power supply , and now added this hd to the computer with very liitle effort . this hd has performed perfectly for us .
0	our mfc - 8840dn worked fine until a paper jam inside the machine caused damage that could n't be fixed by the sales technician . lots of waiting for a response from brother at their call in website . they waited out the warrenty . will never buy from brother or amazon again as a result of this
1	this is an absolutely wonderful product . the cd player in my cadillac was skipping tracks and was a mess . one use of this cleaner ( specially for cars ) and my player was good as new
1	i am kind of a shortwave junkie , and have a few radios all over the place , i must admit that for the money spent , and the performance and endurance , this little bugger is probably my best buy ! i can not believe the sound quality or the reception , its phenominal ! i can pick up shortwave inside the meat packing plant where i work ! ( big heavy steel freezers ) it is a simple , small no frills , pocket size radio , but it blows away anything in its price range , trust me
0	the product seems like a great idea , however , it did not come with attatchments for an i-pod , which is the reason we bought it . called the company to get the adapter and now need the mfg part number . it has just been a hassle
0	i purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle . they are were very uncomfortable from the start , but i could listen to music . that did n't last long . the connection would not hold and if i did n't hold it together , the music faded out . also , music faded in and out from ear to ear . i finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less
0	they listed the 49x and they shipped the 49a ( standard capacity ) , so like everyone else who bought this product , it is really the standard capacity toner that you are going to get . you may get it at a lower cost elsewhere check around ... .
0	we purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house . with all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft . at first it worked like a charm , but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason . we take good care of our electronic stuff so we were very surprised when the shredder stodecided to stop working . then last week i added 2 sheets of paper and the shredder broke . useless ! ! !
1	buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days , but i still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again.used to have one years ago ... now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer.the equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer.it allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer
1	this product is exactly as described and arrived very quickly ... a+++++ seller ! will definately buy from again
1	i have had this items before , in fact this is a replacement for one that was mounted on my motor home . the windshield had to be replaced and a new antenna was needed . works fine , just like the one before . a very eash purchase and fast delivery
1	i struggled between this and the shure e2c . i decided on the e2c , after comparing also with the etymotics r6i and the ultimate ears superfi3 . this one has the least clarity , but wonderful bass . if i do n't listen to as much classical music , i 'd definitely pick vmoda vibe . it makes even terrible pop songs sound cool . i had to reject it because wearing it was not comfortable for my left ear at all for some reason , and i had an extremely hard time putting it in , even with the help of my bf . the vmoda did not come with any foam , only the silicon ear pieces . i settled on the less bass but more clarity and more comfortable e2c
0	i bought this as a travel charger for my blackberry . all i can say is awful , awful , awful . i followed instructions in the manual ( which are pretty easy ) and charged up the solio . after waiting twice as long as required , i tried to plug it into my blackberry 7250 to see how it charged -- big mistake . not only did it not charge a weird red `` battery '' icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed . i tried this routine several times over several days with the same result , rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous . finally , i had enough and told the customer service for solio that i was returning it . not only did they never return my money ( i had to call my cc company to handle it ) no one ever said what the problem could be . my advice : stay away from this thing -- it may seen cool or environmentally friendly , but it is junk a piece of over-priced junk
0	i guess this is a bad review owing to bad item description , not bat quality . turns out , it is not a universal ipaq stylus set , so make sure your ipaq is combatible ! !
1	the belkin tunetalk is fabuous for using an ipod as a digital recorder . i have had very good results recording various music rehearsals ( children 's choir to big band ) with and without an external powered microphone ( sony ecm-ms908c stereo mic ) attached . since i already had the mic , the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a zoom digital recorder for this type of recording . i have n't plugged it into a mixing board yet . i suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a mackie 1202 or better . i bought a usb power adaptor so i would n't have to worry about battery drain . it plugs into the tunetalk and provides power to the ipod . no , it is n't as good as a high dollar recorder , dedicated mic-pre 's and a pair of neumann mics . serious recording requires serious equipment . however , for all those other recordings , the tunetalk stereo is a great recording option for about $ 60 and your trusty ipod .
0	machine started making loud grinding noises when started or while printing . showed it to a repair shop , says the fuser is a toast . replacement cost part and labor $ 300 . died just after one year so have to bear the expense . poor design/quality . beware , i searched the web and looks like i am not the only one with this problem
0	i bought this item with good price . good deal for the space 300gb . moved all personal videos and data with confidence . after 6 months no power coming up . unable to switch on . went to data recovery center and told $ 700 to $ 3000 depend on the issue . seagate want to replace the drive but helpless on the data . be careful when you buy these `` seagate® 3.5-inch pushbutton backup external hard drives '' . - venkat vinnakota
1	i tried many other adapters and this was the only one that worked for my pda
0	i have this radio and it 's a pos . remote is n't very responsive and the display is waaaay too bright ( will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person ) and the user interface is terrible . the thing gets lousy reception and in general , there is a reason why this is always the lower priced ipod type radio on websites . they are trying to get rid of it because it s_cks ! ! ! ! ! !
1	are they the best no.. do they impress people who havent hear them before yes ! ! to me thats the best compliment , they are much more objective listeners with no preconcived notions . all i ever hear is `` those speakers sound so good '' `` i love those cool little speakers '' etc . i 've played everything from bach to dio and they sound very realistic . subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level . at [ ... ] they are a steal.. i paid [ ... ] in 1991 and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new .
1	i bought this item , since i always make a lot of notes from books and other papers , and do n't want to type it in manually anymore . this scanner , probably like any other model , needs a little training to get it right over the paper , but once done , it really works and faster than typing ! i dont use the addressbook or options with your gsm but they are no doubt very handy . i just scan in from papers , and beam it to my laptop . both infrared and the cable work . the cable is especially great for using the scanner 'live'on the screen : the scanned text appears on the pc as you type ! the dictionary also comes in very handy . it must be a very complex product , but just like the ipod or zenxtra mp3 players : they work ! so buy one and save some time ! excellent and recommended for anyone that needs to make notes , or studies , or just wants to stop cutting out pages in newspapers in a train e.g
1	works just as expected . switches quickly among two desktop machines and a laptop ( all running winxp ) . each machine takes & lt ; 1 min to recognize , same as when plugging in any new usb device . very durable cables . was concerned about using wireless keyboard/mouse , but works great with the microsoft wireless desktop , including the multimedia function keys . version of the switch that i received is black , not white as pictured
0	each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data . do n't waste your money on this one
1	ya tengo una semana con el y lo recomiendo ampliamente la imagen y la nitidez de este monitor son sobresalientes con una resolucion de 1680 x 1050 las fotos tomadas con mi camara digital se ven como una imagen real tiene varios ajustes segun el uso que le quieras dar viene en español
0	i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer . i wasnt impressed . i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up . i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three `` processes '' without successful results . it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs . i dont think this is a good `` repairer '' of any disc thats more than mildly scratched . my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon ! ! many of my cds i have replaced for $ 7-10 bucks on here . i wish i wouldve kept my $ 25
0	i use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the gps-360 device further down the dashboard . this adapter apparently ca n't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle . i 've only used it twice - first time , it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half . the connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable , but i 'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again . i do n't want the connector to snap off next
0	manual and i can not find that it supports sacd
0	i purchased this to replace my 10 year-old bel 846i , and was really disappointed . it is difficult to tell in the picture , but the portion of the detector that appears light grey is actually kind of silver . on its own , i would n't particularly like the color scheme , but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield . i ca n't believe they 'd think this was a good idea . for some reason , i was getting false laser alerts like crazy -- empty subdivisions , on the expressway without a police car in sight , parking lots ... at first , i thought my phone might be interfering with the detector , but i was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off . i 'd expect this with a cobra detector that cost half as much , but this is pretty terrible . based on other reviews , i do n't think this is isolated to a defective unit .
1	one lvel up from the es30vs , much more capable of the last generation the es35vs is a versatile unit capable of handling all home recording needs and most professional needs as well , remote control is easier to use than the last generation , the addition of the dvi input gives it ease of recording from camcorders with a clikc of a button , i am very happy with this uni
0	i just received the printer . in trying to set it up , i realized there is no computer to printer cable included , nor any explanation of what kind you need . you have to bail out of the setup and solve that little dilema
0	i purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it . the drive has a controller board error . i contacted western digital for a replacement , but they tell me that it is out of warranty . apparently the year warranty starts ticking the day the drive leaves the factory and not the day you purchase it . if it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from western digital . with other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties , i will never buy western digital again
0	this sucker could n't pick up a single channel ; not even one less than 10 miles away . i live in a fairly open area
0	poorly designed . i slide my 2400 into it and the case is so tight it pressess buttons on my ipaq for me . turning it on in the case . cheaply constructed . you can buy better for less . check out the cases [ ...
1	cool ! i can expand my-single-usb-port-laptop more flexible . from single peripheral to be quadruplet . i can plug flashdisk , mouse , external and digital camera in same time . worth money for usefull gadget
1	it was great that the nikon d8 purchase included a sandisk micromate with usb connection
1	excellant product , excellant price , hope to do business again , ty , for fast speedy shipment , a pleasure doing business with you
1	great joystick ! i did n't think i could find any better than my sidewinder , but i was wrong ! very configurable and smooth
0	i just cam from las vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that does n't allow for more photos after only using 40mb . i have tried to format the disk using the camera and through windows xp . it does n't allow it to be formatted . bad investment ! ! ! would not recommend the product unless there is a way i can get a refund or an exchange
0	according to sysinternal 's process explorer , both hwi ( hardware interrupts ) and dpc ( deferred procedure calls ) tend to run to 3 % -40 % each while this card is installed ; both drop to under 1 % once it 's removed . both remain under 1 % while using another manufacturer 's ( usb-based ) 802.11/b wifi adapter . i 'm given to understand that such high hwi and dpc rates often indicate buggy drivers , but i 've found no useful driver update info on d-link 's web site , last i looked . that other /b adapter , btw , gives better throughput than this /b/g card of d-link 's
1	i have an explorist 210 and this bracket fits it like a glove . good sturdy bracket , uni-directional , with strong suction cups - installed over a month ago and still has not come loose from windshield . great product for the money ( in my case $ 30.76 + free shipping ) . purchased a second one for my other vehicle .
1	this bluetooth remote device works as advertized with my apple notebook . be sure to insert the bluetooth card all the way into the printer slot before you begin . i thought mine was in far enough at first , but it really was n't . one caveat : i was hoping that the bluetooth signal would be strong enough to enable printing from the next room , but it 's not . also new users should know that they can set up their computer to handle both bluetooth and cable at the same time
0	i bought this item not to cool my laptop , but to provide some insulation from the heat when it 's on my lap sitting in a chair . i 'm very satisfied with it 's being able to accomplish that . however , the cord ended up breaking after a few months . targus replaced it at no charge which is good , but still a hassle . now one of the two fans has started making a racket when i first turn it on . after a bit it settles down but very noisy at first .
0	my drive fail after one year and a half ... ! ! ! this company really suck big time ... .i lost all of my data ... ! ! ! all off it ... ! ! ! this is the third one that fail out of four of them i purchased last year ! ! ! total junk ... ! ! ! never buy a lacie again for sure ... .maxtor external is the best ! !
1	when i got my hands on the pmc-120 i thought this was going to to be the best player but when i started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way . i agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation-device feel to it . music : when i tried to put music in my pmc it syncronized my mp3s with the wmp 10 with no problem ( very fast ) . if u are looking for a grab and drop ( copy/paste ) your music mp3 device , this is not for you because when i did it got everything in one same folder that read `` unknown artist and album '' . so you have to put all your mp3s via wmp 10 , wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast . the problems that i encountered is that it only has one `` portable playlist '' and sometimes when im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button . one cool thing is that it shows the cd covers without having to put them in . this is done via the wmp10 . the sound is very good and crisp , and the equalizer setups are fair.but you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound . pictures : this is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders . you can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a pc to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you . video : ok , now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me ... i wanted a portable media device that i would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid . i knew that this device only reads wmv but it `` supports '' divx , xvid , mpeg , etc . this `` support '' deppends on what the wmp10 can play . so this means that you sincronyze ( via wmp10 ) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into wmp movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your pmc secreen size . i had this in mind when i bought it and was fine with me untill i tried it the first time : the wmp10 wouldnt convert my xvid movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that i had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the wmp10 . so after uninstalling and installing i was good to go so i converted a 1:45hr long movie in only 25 minutes . but this short moment of joy was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the wmp10 fits the widescreen movies into the pmc and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable ! ! ! ! you cant change this because the wmp does this automatically . my answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into wmv files . the problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert ... i have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the wmp10 . in the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the wmp10 and it does it very fast and with good quality . you can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so i think this option is useless on the pmc . so the veredict is : the pmc-120 is a good multimedia player with minor glitches . it is a little bulky but personally i think the size is not that big . i think the good side of the size issue comes along with its big 3.6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video . if you want to play directly your divx or xvid movies on your player buy another porduct like the iriver pmp series or the archos players wich are way , way , way more expensive . so i think that for the price and for what it does the pmc-120 gets two thumbs up .
1	i 'm not any expert in the computer world . but this product it is very easy to install . the range is very strong . i 'm very hapy with this product ! ! !
1	oem charger failed . replaced with this one -- it 's more compact functions well
1	i love this remote . i was afraid that having a non-tivo brand unit ( toshiba brand tivo unit ) would require lots of setup ( testing dozens of codes before finding the right one ) . mine worked just as soon as i put batteries into the unit . the buttons are quite intuitive ; i never used the user 's manual yet . a real winner . an inexpensive replacement for the real unit
1	i bought this drive from pcuniverse on amazon and i am generally happy with the service i received and product quality , i have not used it for long time yet but have managed to fill up most of the drive . the speed looks good even over wireless network . i also like the truecrypt encryption software bundled which is actually freeware ; seems to be quite capable an usable with any drive ( usb flash or disk drive , look at [ ... ] it seems much better than the software that comes with many flashdrive in terms of capabilities . i am surprised that there is not a lot of competition in the 8gb flash business yet possibly because people do n't need it . i had a corsair 1gb drive from 2 years back and it worked quite well ; upgraded to 8gb as my data requirement grew
0	disaster . supposed to work in conjunction with cordless phone extensions but will not work with other desk phones ! it only works with cordless phones . i wanted a desktop phone on every desk with the cordless as a convenient extra feature but now every office is stuck using only the very clumsy cordless handset . we were not informed of this until after we purchased and installed the phones . no mention of the hold 'music ' in the manual . this product is a mess . stay away . get a real phone system
0	i bought this premium priced product because it has both built-in voice-mail and speakerphone . the latter was the key feature i sought . well , it works intermittently , just enough so you can tell ( occasionally ) that it 's `` on '' but infrequently enough that you ca n't actually use it to carry on a meaningful conversation . it reminds me of the `` can you hear me now '' commercials . i 'd rather live with courtney than own this piece of junk one more day ! all the other complaints from others are absolutely true as well . ugh . do not buy this product ! !
0	bought this product to stream hd media from pc/usb storage . all though advertised on the box and website it does not play the hd media . i tried to play the media from all 3 available inputs ( 802.11 ( wireless ) , ethernet , and usb hd ) and several formats that are supported ( avi , mpeg2 , ts , mp4 ) . the hd movies were choppy at best . plays all other non hd videos without a problem . divx videos as well ( even though it does n't say it plays them on the box ) . worked well with 500gb usb drive but not needed . would not recommend because hd feature is useless . dlink technical support said to take it back to the store . there technical support grade is d- .
1	i do n't know what the fuss is all about about this unit 's `` fan noise '' ... after the firmware update , if one bothers to do o it , the fan noise level is really trivial compared to advantages of huge storage space ( or data redundancy if one should choose to use raid 1 ) . the sound of the fan is about as loud as a fan from a pc workstation ( one of those dell precisions or macpro/powermacs ) . one of the things i wish could be different about the unit is if the raid configuration could be more easily managed by using apple 's disk utility instead of using wd 's own proprietary software ( which requires a reboot ... an annoying thing on mac osx.4 which i almost never ever have to reboot ) . and then the button manager requires yet another reboot before the functionality can be fully utilized ... hello , western digital ... mac is no microsoft windows where users are used to rebooting often ! if you want more of mac users ' business , write your apps like a true osx app ... at most i should be able to just log out and then log back in to use the functionalities ... other than that , the unit is a work horse . i use superduper to backup my mac and so far have had no issues at all with it ...
1	i bought this system recently after my panasonic dvd surround system broke . i was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on amazon and other sites for that matter . but i could n't find anything like this value and decided i could just take it back if i did n't like it . well , i love it ! the sound is great ! subwoofer is awesome ! i do not hear a hissing noise at all . this sounds so much better than my panasonic which broke and that i had paid $ 100 more for
0	i took the tv out of the box , plugged it in and nothing . after pushing the on/off switch repeatedly , it finally came on . picture and sound were terrific so i was very pleased . turned it off with the remote . of course , the tv would n't turn on again with either the remote or the switch . pushed the switch about 10 times and it finally came on . i called panasonic customer service who could not do anything to fix it by phone . so now my new tv is in for a warranty repair less than 24 hours after i received it . talk about frustrating ! !
1	i 'm using this monster cable to connect my ipod to my receiver via an ipod dock and it works flawlessly . sound is crisp and clear . plus , it 's a lot cheaper than getting the actual monster ipod av cable . the length of the cable makes it convenient but not too cumbersome . it 's a great way to increase the functionality of your ipod
1	this radio has excellent features for someone who is either new to shortwave radio or just wanting a simple , user-friendly set of controls . also perfect for those that like analogue-style controls that would be encountered on older radios . i have the s-350 , the model that the s-350dl replaces . for general world band programme listening , this radio is fantastic . outstanding speaker . easy to read digital display includes backlight . includes attenuator . clock can be set to 24 hour time . easy to carry anywhere . robust antenna . does not support ssb tuning , which you would need to tune in ham radio . same radio sold under tescun name in other parts of the world
0	i was pretty disappointed with the tune belt because of two main reasons . first , i had to take my shuffle out of the protective rubber case that i usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the tune belt . that was n't such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve . but then i went to wear it for a run , and the arm-band was too small for my arm ! i have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training , but nothing outrageous . i would have thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users . this is unfortunately not the case . so if you have larger than average biceps ( say 17 '' amd up ) , save your money ...
1	my engineering classes do n't allow for the ti-83,86,89 . so i needed a calculator that allowed for matrix reduction , basic vector manipulation , and single variable integration for my engineering class . the matrix reduction capabilities has been a major time saver especially on tests , particularly for solving systems of linear equations especially in my statics , dynamics , and strength of materials class . the `` 2-line natural textbook display '' prevents me from getting lost in a calculation with multiple parenthetically nested expressions and is a must have . the `` scrolling '' ability to grab values from previous calculations saves time and preserves accuracy , very nice . the only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that i thought the exterior design make is awkward to use at times , but that is because i 'm used to square calculators . also i would have like this model offered in black
0	this phone would not charge for us - we had to send it back for a refund
1	i 've been using this nas for a month and it 's great ! the box is quite speedy with a maxtor ata 133 drive with a 16mb cache . i have it wired and it never disconnects and will transfer large files without hanging . got it up and working in around 40 minutes and have it set to incrementally back up my files . very slick ! i ca n't get the built in ftp server to work through my firewall but i think that 's a ports issue . all in all a great box
1	this is one of the best in its class for the low price . quick , and responsive , and very convenient for a frequent web browser . the back and forward buttons on it work like a charm and are perfect for the web
1	i must admit i read many other reviews of this item and was a little apprehensive , however ... . i found this recorder to be outstanding in all the items i 've tried so far . i initially just hooked it up like my old one was and left it for a few hours after manually setting the time ( before reading the instructions ) . this made things more difficult so i started over , set it for everything to be automatic , including the time , left it until the next evening and allowed it to do its ' thing - which it did magnificently . everything worked beautifully and it did a great job . i love the one-touch recording . i found it 's best to read directions one at a time as i want to try something new and have had no problems . so far i have n't tried everything it will do but find it 's very intuitive and not a bit frustrating to use . it 's a joy to hit the tvguide button , highlight the shows i want to watch and hit the record button . so far i have no complaints
1	excellent value for money . my razr is a fully functional mp3 player now ! thanks . :
1	i would give this 5 stars but for a few things : - the included earbuds are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears during exercise - syncing is sometimes buggy - you have to load all podcasts manually - podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player , no matter how you arrange them in itunes recent releases of itunes have solved some , but not all , of the sync issues . also , i have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem , but they involve rebuilding your library , and furthermore from what i 've read they 're just temporary fixes . apple needs to fix this . still , the small form factor , cool design , and easy-to-use controls make this a great product . i sold my 4g 40gb ipod right after i got this , and i have no regrets .
0	the paper stripes of 1/4 '' are too wide . at times information such as names and phone numbers came out very clear . if somebody is really after information he should n't have much trouble finding it after you throw away your paper
0	i bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied - until last week when it stopped functioning altogether . i really expected a better product and durability from microsoft . i 've since bought a logitech vx revolution cordless laser mouse for notebooks and love it .
1	i got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it . the unit is beautifully designed , fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small . my only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong . i live in a tough area for reception , and there 's slight static on my favorite stations . the fm antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit , but the reception is still not totally clear . that being said , i 'm glad i got it , and when my wife 's happy , i 'm happy
1	i 'm very pleased with my iriver . i have tons of room to store all my favorite songs and even sermons ! i do a lot of driving and i listen to it all the time
0	the card was defective . have applied for refund from amazon and have bought another to see if this one works . hopefully wo n't have to keep doing this too many times ... have already wasted a lot of time on this . pretty frustrating
0	bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera . it worked for 2 days.after that , everytime i on the camera , it wanted me to reformat the card , wth is that ? now i ca n't use it at all ... . i 'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from amazon.one mistake i made , i threw away the shipping and product packages once i tested out the card , thought it worked and it would be ok.i can no longer return it now . needless to say , i 'm too over confident with lexar 's products . buyers beware ...
0	rarely do i write a review but this product is so bad i had to . expecting sony electronics to perform well , what a disappointment , this one is a bummer . save your money . there has got to a better under cabinet radio out there . while the concept is good and the design sleek ; do n't be fooled by the packaging . nothing works well . fm reception is poor , sound is terrible , controls are not intuitive . to top it all off a year after purchase ( yep , the warrantee just expired ) the cd player decided to only play the first track of any cd inserted . forget listening to the rest of it . this product is really zero stars . i 've tossed the whole works in the garbage
1	this card is great for the seamless apple look and feel ( and only option for internal in imac/ibook/pb ) but it is way overpriced now that it is out of production . there are other options . belkin f5d6050 usb b adapter has drivers for 9.2 and osx , several manufacturers ( e.g . certain belkin , linksys , microsoft ) pci cards have airport extreme chipsets ( broadcom ) on them that osx reads as a real airport xtreme card . you need to do your research and some cards have different chipsets in different revisions , but it is pretty easy overall - and you can save $ 100
1	while these recorders are considered `` old fashioned '' by electronic geeks , they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape . mine paid for itself in the first 5 minutes of a legal deposition when i jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape . he still insisted he could n't remember anything , but had to admit it was his voice and that he -- being the model of honesty and truth -- must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke . very effective , these `` old-fashioned '' recorders .
1	it was up and running in 15 minutes . had to order wifi adapter to get program updates - got it and it installed automatically . i would buy it again
1	monster has always had the reputation to being the best in quality for their products ... when you think of wires , you can not help think of monster cable ... i used this cable to connect my carputer to my factory head unit ... ran up the middle of the car , grouped with a vga cable and multiple usb cables , there is no feedback at all.. i was worried the vga feed may leak into this cable but monster did not let me down.. i highly recommend this product ... but as others on here have stated.. little pricey ... in the end 'you get what you pay for !
1	i bought this product to hang a 42 '' lcd . i am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns . the mount is only 32 '' wide . the `` virtual axis '' tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me . there are only two tilt options with this mount , vertical ( hugs wall nicely ) and the 5 degree . being 32 '' wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16 '' centers . make sure you get at least 2 studs . my experience is this mount does not support vesa 400x800mm pattern . 800mm is ~31.5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than ~30 apart . my tv did have another attaching pattern but i had to use the m5 bolts ( provided with mount ) . i would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where i could use the thicker m8 bolts . a 42 '' lcd is n't going to weigh as much as a 50 '' + tv , so take that into consideration . i am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy .
0	i followed the install instructions to the letter , but the install program started giving me an error that i could n't get past . i downloaded the latest install from the linksys web site and got past the point where i had been getting the error , but i could n't get the print server to connect to my wireless network . when i had the print server connected to my network via an ethernet cable , it detected the attached printer but could n't even print a test page successfully . this product was a complete waste of time
0	i received this item and it proved to be defective . i have returned the original item and amazon has been promising me that they would ship the replacement for over a month now but has failed to make any of their estimated ship dates . right now i am looking for another source and about to cancel the order
1	i bought this bag as a replacement for another roller bag for my 17 '' laptop and was surprised at how compact the design is and how weight conscious it is . the storage capacity and location for such things as chargers and cords in the space where the roller frame is makes this thinner than my previous bag . i also appreciate the smaller zippered pocket on top for things like plane tickets and things that you need quick access to . as an engineer , i must say the design is well worth the price and certainly is a practical way to carry a larger laptop
1	this might be the best thing apple has ever made , it works perfectly with my mac book pro and my pcs . the security is awsome and it has great range with easy instalation . after many flaws with my lynksys , i took the risk with this and it was worth it . i have never had a problem with this
0	about a year ago i got one of these to allow me to play dvds for my kids on my laptop while travelling . it has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low -- well it sounded immediately . i figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs . i had n't tried to use it since . now that i 'm taking another trip , i thought i 'd try it out in other cars . no luck . the thing is dead -- does n't do a thing when i plug it in
0	i was very excited to try this product on my powerbook g4.. it worked the very first time.. but after a restart.. it no longer worked . was quite disappointed as i tried to reset it and try setting ut up again . it was fruitless . so i dont recommend this product as i 'm truly upset with its performance
0	i purchased this product to replace a really good 802.11g unit from linksys , hoping to set up a gigabit home network with ethernet storage . i initially considered the wrt300n model , but the reviews were mediocre . so i went instead for this newer model , hoping that linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the wrt300n model . i am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the wrt300n also apply to this model . i am returning it after 5 hours of use . on my home network set up with my current linksys 802.11g unit , i am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house , and all four movies display flawlessly . on this new unit optimized for streaming video , i was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit . the movie had interruptions every 4-5 seconds . this was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit . performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with g cards and n cards . and performance degraded as i tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time . the speed of the links to my laptops equiped with n cards was 144 mb/s , and was 54 mb/s on those equiped with g cards . so the connection seemed fast enough . it might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way , it might be able to perform as i expect . but i do n't have time to waste on such tweaking , and given that my 802.11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box , there is no point to `` upgrade '' to this new flawed model . i 'll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out
0	this item is an all around piece of garbage . after about 3 months of light use , it is stuck in 45 rpm mode . i sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode . do n't buy this piece of garbage , unless you like owning garbage , in which case this is right your alley , the garbage alley . i would n't even give this to a bum , because i would feel bad about it .
0	i bought this product as a way to keep a large amount of backup data saved , however i have fought with the drivers for days now . whenever the drive is working the usb on my computer does not work , if i try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes ( even with the newest updates ) i will be returning this product asap . i 'm very disappointed and will not be buy netgear again ! i only wish there was a 0 star revie
1	this cable really cleaned up the display image . i had been running another monster cable - the 6 meter version . i needed the length before because of the way my system was configured . i have a review under that cable about how quality does matter . and so does length . at the time i wrote the review i was just ordering the cable and was posting what i had found out in researching digital video signals . everything in there stands true . i changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable - the 1 meter version - because i could now get away with a much shorter cable . i installed it this morning and the difference , while not earth shattering , was definitely visible . i use this cable to connect between the video card on a media pc and my tv ( sony rear-projection lcd ) . the image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows , text , etc. , and the image was n't as clear as i had hoped . while the image looked good , it did n't look great . that 's why i decided to take the plunge and spend an extra $ 79 bucks . the difference is somethine like going from a regular rf feed to your tv and component video cables . now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming . it actually brings out detail i could n't even see before - to the point of deciding to turn on fsaa and filtering so video games have a more realistic look . and that they do . i do n't know how other brands compare to the monster cables as i have n't tried them . what i do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display . you can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing . one more thing while i 'm here . i want to thank amazon for going the extra mile on customer service . i had a dvd disappear somehow during shipping . ups said they delivered it but i never received it . i asked amazon if they filed the report with ups or i did to file a claim . what i got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way . that is service . thanks amazon
1	great invention to those who do n't want to be attached to an ipod , and like an updated version of a `` juke box '' . easy to use , load , unfortunately however , it requires an receiving unit to broadcast the sound
1	i have this radio for two weeks now . i am very satisfied with the reception of am , fm and short wave -- very sensitive . has great sound . the only negative is the lack of being able to preset the stations . would buy the radio again - worth the money
0	maybe if these were high end rechargable nimh this would be a reasonable price . but for alkaline ? this is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell . you can find aaa battieries on amazon for a third of this price
1	... i have been using this drive for a few months now and have no complaints . one of my laptops only has a usb 1.x port and it is incredibly slower for backups . that has no reflection on this product , but be ready for things to work slowly unless you have usb 2.x and do n't blame it on this drive . :
0	very very not user friendly ... . no instruction to install . worked after it got installed but doesnt work with the wireless internet in my house . decided to resell it . could be its only because i 'm apple-illeterate ...
0	this product costs too much for being such poor quality , i can literally just pull the cord apart bare-handed without using barely any force at all . and after it 's torn apart there is no hope of repairing it , no matter how much time , effort , and thought you put into it , it 's impossible . i 'm pretty sure that it 's inability to be repaired is just a marketing ploy so you will buy another . the only good qualities these earphones have is their sound quality , and their comfort . the sound quality sounds a little better than the normal ipod earphones and you can keep them in your ears for a very long time without your ears getting sore . but if you plan on using these while you 're leading a busy , active life , i guarantee that they wont last a week . i heard that these earphones are the best ... i found out that they are indeed some of the worst ... and sadly i found that out the hard way..
1	`` my husband and i bought this for our new home and we 're both thrilled ! he loves that it holds our new tv and stereo system , and i love the way it looks . it 's extremely sturdy and he was able to put it together in less than a couple of hours . we 're so glad we found something we could both agree on ! what a great piece of furniture !
1	picture sound all great . the only problem is that you must have an advanced degree in english , engineering , and computer science to set the television up . without my cable company making a house call setup is impossibl
1	i have used these batteries in a variety of applications and find they perform very well . can tell no difference in their performance vs the name brands
1	i bought this phone and three expansion handsets about a year ago and could n't be happier . the phones have the clarity of a corded phone . the built in intercom system is perfect . the phones allow you to `` name '' the handsets as we did ( kitchen , basement , bedroom , etc ) so you can page based on location rather than remembering numbers . they have a reliable and effective speakerphone built in , as well as jacks for headset ( though the speakerphone seems to make this unnecessary . one problem with these phones is the batteries . in the year that we have had them , the battery life on all of the phones has degraded severely . often my wife would be on conference calls for one to two hours , and we would go through all four phones . leave a phone off the charger and in a day it 's useless . the only solution was to replace the batteries ( which was significantly cheaper and easier than buying new phones and re-programming all the phone numbers ) . i recommend the energizer er-p240 , which is a nickel-metal hydride battery and wo n't develop the ni-cad memory effect . i love that the base station has a place for 4 aaa batteries so that the system can still be used during a power outage
0	i bought one of these and it broke the first day i used it . amazon replaced it for free , but for no good because the second one broke soon after i got it too . very poor laminator . i went to office depot and bought one from xerox and it works much better
1	i liked options and text edit . i really liked the ability to scan into micsoft word
1	i have had my samsung for about three weeks now ; no problems . i am extremely hapy with the picture quality and the number of inputs . we also bought the 42 '' plasma for my parents ; we 've been extremely happy with it as well . in addition to the television , i am extrmemly happy with amazon and the delivery process . everythin was handled very professionally . the tv arrived within the timeframe and undamaged . i will buy next tv through amazon as well
0	i returned my banshee stereo . it sure was loud , however the music seemed to wave in and out . you can not charge your ipod either . there is no remote . there is no battery compartment - not portable at all . there are many other choices for less price . save your money and look for something else
0	i love this minisisc . it holds an incredible amount of songs -- the equivolent of an i-pod mini -- and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great . but do n't buy it here ! just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by $ 9.00 while everything else in my order would have been shipped free . and you can get them at your neighborhood radio shack for the same price as here . i got a hi-md recorder instead of an i-pod and i 'm glad i did . just do n't buy the disks from amazon
0	i bought 2 of these and they are horrible ! youu put them in and they sometimes work and sometimes dont its such a pain in the arse !
1	this is a solid device , and i like the included software for burningb dvd as well as c
0	do n't buy these batteries , because they do n't last long like energizer or duracell . these eveready batteries ai n't never ready
0	this picturemate has been a total disaster . after printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow . put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again . not only does it not print many photos with a true color image , but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos . do not waste your money on this product
0	i placed an order for this kingston memory stick only to have my order cancelled without explanation . very lousy customer service
0	usually i discount negative reviews . i think people may have sour grapes against a company , or not understand how to install or work something . i somewhat tech savvy - i installed our wireless network that took a little doing . i work as a technical recruiter , so technology does n't intimidate me . i like technology . so i had been nudging my husband for a print server so that i could print without going to the printer and plugging in . he came home with this belkin product and went about installing it . usually i like to research before i purchase a product , but he wanted to handle this . so , he installed it , and i went back and checked his work , and he had followed the instructions exactly . i know he had some trouble , and had called tech support at my suggestion - i would never have gotten the wireless router hooked up without tech support . the only problem is , that the printserver does n't work . so , i tried installing the software on my pc , and trying to problem solve from there . i called the tech support hotline back , and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time . i waited for 2 hours , then went out to run some errands . there was still no message from a technician when i returned . this morning my husband needed to get some work done from home . he created a document , and knowing that the print server did not work , he wired up to the printer to print that way . but now , the printer wo n't respond to the signal , so he ca n't print that way either . so we deleted the belkin software and rebooted the computer . he still ca n't print . so , i went back to my pc , and tried to delete the software through the control panel . it wo n't delete . i am getting an error message . i ca n't print either . so now i am on hold with belkin customer assistance . maybe it 's a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is , i swear i hear a little indian accent . that does n't mean that customer support has been outsourced to india , and even if it is , that does n't mean customer support is bad . but my experience with this is that while i can get a real live person on the phone , he ca n't do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back . when i tried to get my problem escalated , i overwhelmed him and he put me on hold . i am still on hold . i have been on hold for 35 minutes with no help in sight . i called back from my cell phone , and someone who sounded so much like the first operator i spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level 2 technician , and someone would call back in 1-2 hours . when i strongly protested , asked for his name , asked for a number i could call directly , he offered to transfer me immediately , and now , i have been on hold for for an additional 10 minutes on my cell phone . i am starting to sense a trend here . my husband - boiling over his inability to print an important document , has gone off to work to print it there . i am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo , waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call . i usually discount negative reviews , but this is really my experience with this product , and if you are considering purchasing it , i would encourage you to think that through a little further .
0	has anyone else experienced the following ? : used the first twenty or so in a stack of 100 without any problems , then have run into ( so far ) a run of at least 30 defective discs after the remainder sat unused for a few months . after various attempts to narrow down the problem , i tracked it down to the blank cd-rs . i had exactly the same problem occur with another brand , which was replaced with these tdks . is there some unwritten shelf life for blank cd-rs or am i just unlucky ?
0	to be short , the performance is less than great but ok , but i can live with that since i have dozens of them , i do n't care if it runs out faster . but what i could n't stand if that it also set my charger on fire since one of them leaked , i could n't imagine what would happen if i did n't come to my desk in time
0	this mic is a piece of trash ... i bougth it and you have to shout to be listened..es una completa basura y una perdida de recursos
1	the product works well for my space and needs . one note to amaazon . when you ship a $ 400 item , thats semi fragile , and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball , how does the consumer deal with physical damage ? the item is so massive to ship back , and most likey costly . i experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right . i was worried how the shipping would be handled , and sure enough , i was worried rightfully . the dvd tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out . the top of the receiver/dvd player had been slightly caved in . even with all the packing samsung supplied , it could not protect the product from the shipping company . it will be such a hassle to try and exchange this , that i am not sure if i will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again . other than that , i have purchased smaller items , and less fragile from amazon with no issues . i realize that the shipping damage canot be held on amazon , as it is out of their control . i just do n't think i will roll the dice on something like this in the future . too bad , it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen
0	this product has a known defect for serial numbers r641 and less ( see logitech website ) . i just received my amazon order and it was serial number r635 . it will be sent back tomorrow . hopefully , amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own , rather than relying on its customer base
1	i wanted something to use while mowing the lawn without emptying my bank account . cuts the lawnmower noise to a tolerable level , and the sound quality is decent . headphones are comfortable and adjust easily . unit collapses down to a more manageable size for transportation . good battery life
1	turns out i do n't like in-ear ear phones . the sound on these is good , though the bass is a bit much in my opinion . the in-ear style makes me feel deaf to the outside world . if you do like this style , these are pretty good .
1	works as advertised and works really well . i purchased it to provide a serial port for a virtual windows machine running inside mac os x. i used to have issues with other products , but not this one .
0	got the phone and found out that in order to mount it to the wall , i need to purchase a $ 4.00 part and pay $ 5.00 shipping and taxes . now all the specs say wall mountable , not wall mountable with an extra purchase ! ok , $ 8-10 is n't going to break me , but somewhere it should state that you need to get an extra bracket in order to mount it on the wall ! so , since i ca n't mount it on the wall , i have n't used it yet ! have to wait a week or so for the wall mount bracket to come in ...
1	this receiver puts out a lot of power . it also has a bit of weight to it . it comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound . the remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a dvd player , cd player , radio and many other devices . the display is nice . you really have to read the manual before you start plugging away . if you 're a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up
0	in theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks , relatively compact and attractive however i purchased three of these ( 2 for me 1 for a friend ) i ca n't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers , making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness . ( ... ) . all in all , a disappointment
1	it can transfer flash drive sd card to a car mp3 player . that 's very nice . i love it..
1	very pleased w/item . compact . easy to move from place to place
0	did not do what it says it does . only thing this does is remove large scratches . no matter how many times you put this stuff on the small scratches are still . plus it leaves crusty white stuff on the disc and smears . not sure if discs are better before or after the application of this stuff . i guess you get what you pay for . wait no you do n't . all i got was a jewel case , two pads , and two tiny packets of solution . what a rip off . did n't even get a manual . what kind of advertisement is this ? i know , the black market kind
1	seems pretty good . doesnt come with any directions on how to transfer files from your `` c '' drive into it
1	i am quiet satisfied with the t10 . 3 cons : no reset button , aa battery type ( i prefer litium ion ) , primitive menu . 3 pros : mp3 + voice record + fm radio good sound quality belt clip overall success : 80 %
1	i muchly recommend suggest buying purchasing these batteries power sources in the pre-tried used section . you can save pay less for them these that way . but be warned aware , used pre-tried batteries is may be no good since they is not may be rechargedable
1	this is a great product . it was easy to mount and looks great . the only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall , but from what i have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches . i have a 32 '' lcd mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so i always try to keep it closer to the wall , but every time i come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees . this has n't caused any problems and i 'm sure this is well within its design strength . highly reccommended
0	i use to love maxtor . still have one from 1999. so got this box hoping it would be a flexible way to go between two computers . well , the darn thing crapped out within two months and all the data was gone . i did have a lot of it backed up but still , what a pain . now that seagate owns them , spend a few bucks more and get a seagate drive . or get a couple of these and raid them . but sending the thing back to get it exchanged is a pain and you are out over 30 bucks in shipping
0	i bought this hub less than 2 months ago . it has stopped working ! if i plug it in , it is no longer powered . do not buy this p.o.s . !
1	i 've used everything from ableton live to protools to reason and this thing is just plug and play . very easy interface makes for no brainer recording . i 'm a guitarist and the stock sound selections are outstanding . most players drive themselves crazy tweaking their sound but as you know it 's all about the song . the sessions software is a piece of cake and makes it incredibly easy to go with your inspiration instead of getting sidetracked trying to figure out all the bells and whistles . fantastic product guys and for the money it 's a steal
1	this is truly the best wifi you can get on the market right now . its lightning fast its 4 machines put into 1 . most importantly i 've had the best gaming experience ever . now i can host games on xbox live without lagging the rest of my teammates and that is no fun . the linksys wrt330n wireless-n gigabit gaming router is well worth its money and a great investment . i recommend it highly to anyone that needs a great wifi for whatever reason
0	a nice idea that does n't provide adequate audio quality in my experience . the unit would pick up `` noise '' from the operation of my cd player , resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks . in addition , on trips i had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations
0	i bought the terk antenna in an attempt to pick up some am and fm radio stations i was struggling with on my new bookshelf stereo system . perhpas because of my apartment building , or the quality of the stereo , the antenna did n't offer me much success in picking up stations any better than the factory-provided antenna . i did notice improvement in the static ( or lack of it ) on stations that were already tuning in fairly well ( they went from great to excellent ) , but the stations that were tuning in `` poorly '' got no better with the terk antenna . overall , it was probably not worth the money paid
0	i have had this unit for just over a year . beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out . because of this design , it is prone to misalign the cd , which will either not load and the `` no disc '' warning will show or when it does play , there is a significant vibration . to try to remedy this i had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit ! alas , i just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime . it is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a sony ... .. by the way , the buttons are cheap and the overall construction is poor
0	this is just a general review , of all dvd cases . i have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs . i was stationed in germany for over 2 years , and anyone who had been there knows that afn sucks , so dvd 's is your only source of video entertainment . my collection grew to more than 400 . i have been trying to find a good case , that hold equal number of title books as it does dvd 's . but that seems to be asking to much , or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers , you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly ? ? ? ? ? then when you look at the furniture options , everything seems to be made for function , and not style at all , they are generally pressboard p.o.s 's and nothing i would want to keep in my garage ... ... ... . i hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions , cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied ! ! ! ! !
0	i ordered the cisco aironet 1231 the other day , and after it arrived , set it up , and ... could n't get a wireless signal . i called customer support and was told i would be called back by a technician ( which obviously the first person was not ) within an hour . we waited ... and got online to try to figure things out . turns out that in very small print on an obscure documentation page of the 1231 it says at the very bottom that two external antennae are needed for the 2.4 gh wireless ( 802.11b/g ) to work . i was even more disappointed to find out that the required antennae were available online for only $ 16 a piece , which makes cisco look really cheap for not including such a small but vital item with a $ 500 router . although it took an astonishing twelve hours for customer support to get back to me , since i registered my complaint with them they have been very helpful . i really hope that they improve their web site-it really is not that helpful since you have to weed through pages of documentation before you can even begin to find information you need . i still have n't used this router since i 'm waiting for the required antennae i had to order somewhere else . cisco routers are supposed to be good , but as a warning to you , the potential customer , be aware that 1 ) you need to purchase external antennae with this product ; 2 ) my initial experience with customer service was pretty disappointing
1	a great product - snug fit on the laptop , and appears to be a part of the laptop itself . difficult to remove , but no real reason to remove it anyway .
0	it did n't match the acoustic wave player i bought . there should have been also two outdoor speakers , as a promotion for buying both pieces . the page , from which i ordered both pieces , was unclear , and i received the cd player with the wrong cd changer . i had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player . ( i know i 'll be refunded the price of the first changer ) . but by then , the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished . i received the real changer a few days later , but lost the speakers . i think amazon owes me the speakers , which is what the bad page made me miss
1	after having my gps come loose ( barrel pin failure ) on more than one occasion i decided to give this a try . i 've now used this on a 2 month mtb tour of nepal and tibet . held my forerunner 301 securely on hundreds of miles of washboard , technical singletrack , etc . also withstood countless grabby children and curious bystanders in numerous villages . you do not have to remove the wrist band to use it with the mount . i love the reassuring `` snap '' when it locks into the mount , and the wrist strap functions as a safety back up - although it never came loose from the mount on me . convenient release allows you to remove it quickly and easily . my only very minor complaint is you have to remove the gps from the mount to charge it . it fit perfectly on my 1 '' ( 25.6mm ) diameter bars . like it so much i just ordered the `` oversize '' mount for my motorcycle .
0	... i 'm so dissappointed in caselogic for discontinuing the hard cases . they were great , a hard cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside ( that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center ) . somebody could have sat on it and it would 've been fine..
1	i used two 12 foot cables with a coupler for a 24 foot pcm connection between my satellite receiver and my home theater system . the dolby 5.1 is excellent
0	i had trouble with installing the firewire port . i did not get any help with the company .
0	functions absolutely flawlessly under vista 64bit ( unlike most other cards such as my older wintv pvr-150 ) . if not for the next paragraph , i 'd give it five stars for just this . heck , it does better under vista x64 than my old card did under winxp 32 . ( disclaimer : i tested the analog video only , not the digital . ) but i discovered that it was running extrememly hot , even when just sitting their idle . so hot that you literally ca n't even touch it . ouch ! i ended up removing it from the case as i did n't trust it . perhaps it 's a vista driver issue in that the driver is not card go idle even when it 's not in use . emailed tech support but they offered no real answer other than it should n't be warm at all
1	i got the canon cp400 printer a while back so i could make the occasional print to hand out ( or put silly captions on `` bad '' christmas party photos ) . i do n't know how the printer manages to keep the image aligned as the paper goes in and out 4 times ( yellow , magenta , blue , and the clear coat ) but when it drops it out , i have a pretty nice print , complete with address lines and a stamp outline on back ( plus canon logo of course ) - suitable for mailing as a postcard . about 1/2 '' of each end gets removed after printing as it is used for traction of the rubber roller in the printer . i frequently print 3 shots vertically on a 4 x 6 card as sort of a mini proof sheet . i 've also used the 4 x 8 size to print 2 side by side . fun stuff
0	j packs them so poorly that over half of them were shattered beyond repair upon arrival
0	before the repair process there was one bad track on my cd . after the `` repair '' process the entire disk was unplayable . took it back for a refund . with billions of cds in the world , is this the best that the 21st century has to offer ?
1	just wanted to echo what others have said , that these batteries seem to really last . i received a new camera and was using generic rechargeable batteries in it , almost as powerful as the 2500s here , and the batteries ran out after a few hours . replaced those batteries with these , and these just seem to last on and on . am very happy with them
0	the sound quality is fine if you are in range . the dual headsets work as advertised , in other words : 1 . you can not talk on both phones at the same time ( instead , you can transfer a call to the other phone ) . 2 . the range is not great ( though i have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about 30 ft ) 3 . the voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none . other than that , it 's a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household
1	i 'm a fanatic for duplexing since i move a lot of paper around , sometimes amounts which i have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds . the brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well , maybe even the best . this particular machine has wireless g built-in , but it costs over $ 100 more than the same machine without wireless , and for well over $ 100 , you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper , maybe even better , and for my office , wireless is inappropriate . ( it also should be stated that if you go outside briother itself , then the wireless combo is cost-effective . brother essentially competes here only with itself . ) that said , it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone 's printing if several of you are running off of a wireless router . there are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you . it 's a complete standalone fax/copier if someone in the house does n't even have any computer at all . i 'm a long-time brother customer , and they 've made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone . there were a few bugs in earlier machines by brother ( comparable but older machines i 've owned , like the 8500 and the 9700 ) such as faulty out-of-toner warnings , and all of these seem to have been worked out . this machine is clearly out of beta . earlier machines were difficult ( though not impossible ) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual , and this machine is far better on that aspect as well . you can have faxes arrive two-sided , which doubles your paper tray effectively , and you can scan or fax a two-sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting . this last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease-of-use - you would n't use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two-sided page . unfortunately , the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the brothers is the `` ink '' aspect . unlike some competitors , you have to replace a toner and a drum , and at differing intervals . i assume they do this to keep the costs low , but the costs still are n't particularly low . the non-wireless version of the basic machine sells for a little over $ 400 , and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners . i do n't understand why printers of all sorts can not just have a `` gas tank '' you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper , but in most instances , the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer . the brother is a superbly-functioning modern machine at a great price , but do n't imagine the price ends when you buy it . this is true of all printers , however , and the news with most printers is worse than here
0	computer brain sent the wrong product right before xmas so the present that i intended had to be shipped back and it is jan. 16 and i am still awaiting the right one . so i do n't even know what the product is actually like yet
1	the cf card works fine but it 's response is kind of slow compaired to the 32mb cf card came with my canon powershot a95 . i got this card 3 weeks ago and so far their has n't been any problems .
0	i sent it back . the price was right but the caller id did n't function . when i got in touch with at , they told me , maybe this phone is not compatible with the other phones in my home . ( stupid response ! ) i then asked , why would at put a phone on the market that 's not compatible with my other phones , i did n't get a reply ! ! ! they wanted to send me a replacement . i told them there is no point in doing that , if , the replacement phone was not compatible with my other phones ! i guess amazon will be sending it back to at
0	first of all , i am a dyed-in-the-wool techie . i design products like this in my job . i know what every single one of those `` what the heck is that ? '' settings in router set up screens are . so i do take a bit of umbrage when one reviewer called the many ( most ) who have had trouble with this router `` morons '' . yes , i got it to work . it will work right out of the box if used with most pre-n wireless cards and , definitely , if they are linksys pre-n cards . that covers about 1 % of those who would buy this router . after three hours of tweaking a dozen plus of the settings from default , i succeeded in getting it to `` hand-shake '' with b and g mode cards most of the time . it would still randomly lose the ip requiring rebooting everything . not something my customer would accept nor would i sell . some of the techie specs are a long way from what linksys claims . linksys marketing obviously wrote the specs and ads then engineering tried to design to both . they failed . a non-techie spec important to everyone is range . it has 20 % the range of an old b mode linksys router i had sitting right next to it . adding encryption dropped range in half again ! the wired router portion of it works out of the box , no adjustments required . but you 're buying this for the wireless function . yes , i could have tweaked some more and probably managed to get it stable enough to live with . but linksys did n't used to be that way . i used to buy only linksys considering my time worth too much to putz around with unreliable equipment to save my customers a few bucks on hardware . this is the third linksys router in a month ( the other two were g mode ) that have been unstable or doa . then why did i buy this one ? it was on sale and i wanted to give linksys one more chance before they lost my business for good . they 've now lost it for good . i exchanged the router for a netgear and it worked right out of the box into a network running both b and g mode wireless network cards . plus it was a lot less money . has cisco ruined linksys ? got me . did all the good engineers cash out ? i would n't be surprised . are they rushing unfinished bug-filled product to market to meet quarterly profit numbers for wall street ? you bet ! i 'll stick with netgear and belkin from now on .
0	i did not like the fact that this microphone needs a hard to find battery which is not included in the box it was sold
1	what can i say , i got a code at chrismas time through the amazon promotion and got this tv for $ 200 . it 's perfect for a master bedroom set and the picture is great . why spend so much more than the regular amazon price for a more expensive brand when you can get this tv ? no problems and it works wonderfully ! great deal , with free shipping even ! time and again , amazon is great
1	this watch is not only the best watch i have ever owned , it is the only day time watch that i ever use . i love the 1,3,5,10,20 , 30 minute timer found only on this watch . i love it so much that i buy several and change out the band to match different outfits ! i do wish that this watch came in a more dressy version . i also hope that casio continues to make this watch for people who need a timer and a dependable alarm
1	so i received my go-510 and expected it to work right out of the box . it powered up , great windshield adapter , no problems with the connections , bluetooth works perfectly , ipod controls - no problem . just one thing , no satellite fix ! ! it would not lock on - even after one hour in the open sky . i thought , here goes ... .bad tech support ... .ship it back ... but no . i called tech support , got through to a human ( very knowledgable ) in only 20 seconds . problem was fixed by upgrading firmware and the unit works perfectly . i read on many sites of the problems plaguing these units . apparently , they have all the bugs out because every aspect , every feature is cool and workable . the tomtom go-510 is highly recommended in my book and mad props to the tech support crew - way to roll
0	the description gives the impression that the material is made of hard rubber and that it can protect you ipod in `` rugged '' conditions . in reality it is made from very thin flimsy rubber . i suppose will protect you nano from scratches and other cosmetic damage , but it will not porvide any protection from drops or other rough handling
0	the overall construction of the pedal is pretty sturdy aside from the fact that most of it is made of plastic . the sound it produces ranges from a hard overdrive to the hariest shreding distortion . the pedal deminishes tone quite a bit and does n't have a very good range ( very high notes are not processed correctly and deliver poor results ) . not bad for the money but not an investment in the least bit . i just got this because i had a gift certificate that i wanted to get rid of , otherwise i would not have purchased the item
1	this item is br1500 , which also called rs model vs. the bx1500 called xs models . external battery br24bp can be used for both br1500 and bx1500 . the capability to connect external battery is great , since that can help reduce the downtime when california experiencing `` rolling black '' in the summer . there are basically 2 differences between the back-ups rs ( br1500 ) and the back-ups xs ( bx1500 ) models besides their names . 1 . the back-ups rs models have both 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem data-line protection and 10/100base-t ethernet protection , where as the back-ups xs models only has 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem protection . 2 . the back-ups rs models have both boost* and trim** as features of automatic voltage regulation ( avr ) , where as the back-ups xs only has boost . when the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a back-ups xs model it will only go to battery . *avr boost : the ups is compensating for a low utility voltage . while the ups can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the ups , the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently low . **avr trim : the ups is compensating for a high utility voltage . while the ups can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the ups , the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently high . bx1500 does not have the avr trim feature , when ac line voltage is higher than spec , it will switch over the battery power till the line voltage drops into the spec range . please note this is called `` backup ups '' , not the `` smart ups '' line . backup ups does not produce pure sine wave . when power lost , it will take some milli-seconds to switch over to battery power . `` smart-ups '' produces sine wave and the output ac was from dc source all the time . when ac input lost , the ac output will not have any interrupt . for most computers , the `` backup-ups '' is good enough , since the power supply inside pc always have capacitors that can hold for about 100ms or longer . when `` backup-ups '' switched over in about 20ms , the computer will continue operates without much impact . but for a/v equipment , this may be an issue , especially the output is not pure sine wave . i would not recommend use this ups for a/v equipment
0	i set up everthing according to the quick install . all setting is correct but i still could not print . i call technical support , on hold for 20 minuts then told me he was not the right support agent . back in the loop i go . wait for 30 more minutes 2nd agent told me the same thing . do n't waste your time calling thier support . if it work out of the box great if not return it do n't waste ur life like i did
0	looking at the photo of this item , i noticed the plug at the end of this car lighter charger is not the screw on contraption needed for my explorist 400 , so i was hesitant to purchase it until i did further research and found out why the plug is different . you still need the usb cable that came with the explorist and have to bring it in the car too ! the big ac plug detaches from the usb cable , and aha ! now you have a jack that this car charger can plug into ! then you screw that cable onto your gps unit as when you charge it via ac . in other words ... this charger does not plug into your gps , it plugs into your gps charger cable which attaches to your gps . but i do n't want to take that cable in the car with me , because if it gets damaged or lost , then i can never charge the unit at all , not even at home with ac . so i was forced to find and purchase another usb cable assembly seperately , to keep in the car with this car lighter charger . magellan should have just put the screw on connector at the end of this car charger instead of the way they did it . the car lighter charger has a nice coiled cord , but what good is it ? you still have to have the long usb cable attached to it anyway ! but hopefully this will help everyone , that like me , was puzzled by the photo of the item and the connector that is n't going to fit anywhere in the explorist 400
1	i 've been struggling with heat issues for quite some time with my gaming pc and have gone through numerous fans and combinations trying to find a way to keep it cool . i had just about resigned myself to just running with the case open all the time until i bought this . after shuffling my pci cards around so as to allow a space between this and my 6800 ultra i fired the machine up ( and closed the case ! ; - ) and did some gaming , all the while keeping an eye on the temperature of the card . this fan easily dropped the temperature on the card 5-7 degrees celsius when the graphics are running full bore.. once the chaos on the screen starts to subside , the cooling is even better . as an added bonus , this will cool the card down quick once you exit your game . i thought for sure that i would have to trade off cooling for a lot more noise and i was surprised to find that i had to listen for it in order to hear it . about the only complaint i have on this is that the fan speed is manual with a slider on the back ( which i knew when i bought it ) so it is not temperature sensitive . still deserves 5 stars though
0	i went online to amazaon , a site i trusted , to locate an hd radio for my desk at work . this was listed as an hd radio ; only after i received it , opened it , and plugged it in did i discover it is not an hd radio . both the 3rd party vendor and amazon claim i have no right to a refund . the fcc calls this fraud , and my case is added to a couple of hundred across that nation
1	not as easy to use as a larger panasonic i used to own but otherwise fine . good sound . using cd player and radio . buying via amazon as usual is super
0	i am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it . this is a horrible controller . i mean it works well for maybe like a week or two , in that time you love it ... but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with . the triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment . i swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity . i 'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger is n't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade . it can spoil a good game of halo in an instant . occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver . which takes about 10 dear seconds . after the contoller started breaking down , i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air . this controller is [ ... ] and do n't bother picking it up .
1	these fit over everything very well , and they stayed put without stretching out , which is why my original pads fell off . i guess it 's one of those products that you ca n't do much better than $ 10 for , but maybe they could give you double the number of pads or something..
1	i just purchased a mogo mouse , and i 'm *amazed* at how usable it is . i was extremely skeptical ( and probably would n't have bought one ) until i was able to try a colleague 's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is . the one thing - and it 's a pretty big thing - is the lack of `` scroll-wheel '' technology . that 's a sorely missed feature in this mouse . that said , there are always trade-offs , but in this case that 's the only one . battery life seems great , usability is great , convenience is great ... just add the touch pad and it 'll be the mouse for notebook computer users !
1	i bought these for my dvd player . they work wonderfully ! the old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but [ did n't measure up } . these monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies , especially the dialogue . the old cables that i had made my movies sound a bit muffled . but the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever . for those of us who can not afford 5 speaker digital surround sound , i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or cds
0	this router has to be one of the worst made products on the market , and has the poor customer service . this router was defective out of the box , took 3 weeks of communication with linksys 's customer service before i finally just returned it and build my own router with the same functions
1	this is another terrific assortment of sharpie permanent pens , for a very good price . try them . i 'm never without sharpies , and this deal is good
1	this product has worked great with my 2wire gateway modem from at yahoo . the real plus has been the usb connection so its not necessary to take off the desktop 's back panel . the connection has been good , and i set it up in minutes . i tend to think that people who are having connection problems have a problem with their router , and not this device . i can see 50 % + networks from all over my neighborhood
1	the quality of this bag is just great the problem could be the very tiny front bag . it also has a small bag for the ac power cable and transformer but once you use it there is no place to put it comfortably considering a 15 '' laptop
1	amazing sound comes from these tiny inexpensive headphones . the different size buds are very comfortable and help produce the deep bass sound once you find the pair the fit your ear . when i first got them i put the smallest buds on first and thought i had just bought the worst headphones . so i tried the largest buds and found they fit very comfortably and because of the seal they created in my ears they acted as an air tight bass box improving the sound ten fold . and just let you know i ussualy cant wear earbud headphones because they hurt my ear holes or they just do n't fit righ
1	the amd ahtlon 64 venice processor is great . installed into my new gigabyte mb without a hitch and runs very cool . that will give up some room for future overclocking . overall i would highly recommend the processor . by applying for their credit card , i received a really low price from amazon which was very surprising . about $ 170.00 with free shipping and no tax . everyone else was $ 200- $ 230 for the same processor . it is a great cpu at a good price from amazon
1	i bought this to record interviews done primarily on the phone and it 's worked beautifully . clear and easy to use . once downloaded onto my computer i used the olympus transcription package to transcribe the interviews . this allowed me to listen on headphones , control the progression ( and backtracking ) of the interview with a foot pedal and keep both hands on the keyboard to type quickly . this voice recorder plus the transcription package dramatically cut the amount of time i had to take trascribing the interviews . well worth the price . i 'd recommend this combo highly , especially to other journalists .
1	not quite as powerful as i was hoping for , but the sound is alright and in a small room it 'll do fine . careful , there is no plug-in at the back , so you can only connect mp3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack . otherwise it 's easy to use and pretty cool-looking ... ideal for quiet listening , lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff
1	i 'm a college kid , recreational audiophile and bass fanatic , studying engineering . i started off building a custom sub encloser with dual kicker compvr 12 '' subs driven by a 1200w sony amp . i have n't stopped searching for great sound since . i 'm running a pair of these off an h/k avr240 , combined with a jbl ec35 center , a jbl s120pii 400w sub , and two sets of e30 surrounds . i 'm big on trying anything before i buy it . i was able to listen to these and the e80s ( the dual 6 '' floorstandings ) at a local audio store before they were discontinued . i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics . with the jbls at a fraction of the price here on amazon , it was no question . the only issue was what model to get ... i heard very little difference in qualtiy between the e60s and e80s . the dual 6 '' put out a bit lower frequencies , but the difference was so small that i would n't be able to notice without the speakers side by side . living in a small college apartment the e90s and e100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what i needed . i deceided on these over the e60s with the hopes that a single 8 '' would draw less from my amp than the dual 6 '' for a bit less money . beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass . they are a bit top heavy , as any tower will be . and i love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub . movies sound great : saving private ryan , fifth element , 40 year old virgin , anchorman , etc ... etc ... music is also fantastic ( with different amp settings tuned for genre ) : ambient , electronica , hip-hop , rap , jazz , 80s , classical , rock . ulrich schnauss , bonobo , dj shadow , busta , snoop , e40 , louis armstrong , michael jackson , bach , korn , metallica , hoobastank , 311 . if you 're looking for a quality tower speaker ... this is it . bass fanatics , look at the s120pii . you wo n't regret it . ~shakas~
1	i was very surprised at how well this sub articulates the low frequencies . hearing is believing . it gives a certain amount of accuracy and tangibility to base tones that i simply was not able to obtain with a higher priced sub i had purchased . for movies , it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy . it really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market . i am not certain it can go as low as 27hz since i have not measured , but i am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls . i just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system i could . i was able to do so with the addition of this sub . i am glad i found and tried it before paying much more for another sub i was considering . yet i hate the fact that it is advertised as being a 250-watt sub . its peak dynamic power is 250 watts . but the amplifier it contains is a 150 watt amplifier . therefore , it is a 150-watt sub
0	not worth one star ! lasted about 1 week , and then started emitting a high pitched whine loud enough to wake people in the next town . it is now officially dead and useless . even the short while it `` worked '' it was almost useless . switching speed and mouse response was frankly terrible , the keyboard lagged several characters behind my typing and fitting the cables into it was simply not possible . do not buy this . do n't even think about it .
1	i 've had these earphones for about two month and i 've discovered the following . i like the look and they seem to be well made . the only grip i have is that they are not very loud .
0	this is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons . 1 . this hub will not work with any usb powered devices . so forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub . 2 . extremely slow usb 1.1 . this device is not usb 2.0 compliant 3 . it is clunky 4 . does not comke with a power adapte
1	i bought this cute little speaker from walmart ( 14 $ ) and it is so compact and very useful . it also matches with my other speakers of sony dream system . this has 4 usb ports ( so good when they stay on your desktop rather than on your pc sitiing down the table. ) . they are lighted , so that you can plug them in even night . speaker is good quality and it has one usb connection and one dc connection . quality of sound is good if not excellent . overall it is a great buy for the price .
1	this is a great card for a laptop , however they need to correct their problems with the installer for xp . also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge , took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line . once you do get to them they fix the problem right away , seems they know it will not install correctly . then it works great
1	we bought this to use with our ws-300m to record a class . we thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording . in the end , we set the recorder to mono ( hq ) because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other ! good quality but distracting . save your money and buy the mono mic . the quality is excellent in either setting . buy the way , in case you miss it , this mic does come with a cable to connect it to the recorder
1	i wanted a simple printer so i could print a few prints from time to time to hand out . on sale for $ 50 , this seemed like the right one . i already had the included zoombrowser and photo stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a canon a95 camera , so i just needed to install the driver . note this requires a usb cable ( not included ) to the printer . as is human nature , i tried to print without reading the zoombrowser instructions , and got a lovely plain sky-blue print with the words `` my album '' on it - but no photo : - ) then , out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines - this was from a residual click from my first attempt . ok , ok , so i looked at the pdf printing guide for about 15 seconds , and followed the instructions . got a beautiful first print of the queen mary ship . got a gorgeous second print of flags ( red/white/blue , and green ) againt a clear blue sky , and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near mt lassen ( ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints ... ) so , i 've blown through the provided `` trial '' 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge , and have 3 very nice prints ( with postcard address lines , stamp area and canon logo on the back - the paper comes that way . ) the ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1/2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing . i ca n't compare the printing software to any other brand , but setting up a plain photo-only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices . if you want to add backgounds , titles/text , etc , that is available as well . ( got another pack of paper/film , and put humorous captions on kind of funny-bad office christmas pix ... ) printing directly from my a95 takes about the same time as from the computer - about 1 min 45 sec . the actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times ( 3 color passes and a protective layer ) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed , particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot . the finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front . the unit looks and feels substantial for its small size , comes well packed ( survived ny to ca shipping ) , has decent documentation , and a 1-year warranty .
1	this product is really what i expected it to be . it has a very clear display with a high resolution for a 4 inch screen . the stereo sound is really good . and it has a long lasting battery . buttons are easy to use . i tried recording from the television , and it is also satisfying . i had no problem about any divx or xvid video type . i really enjoy watching films with cowon a2 .
0	i had no problems burning to these discs , its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore . after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them , my discs started dying after a few months . in addition , in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become . this is true for all the discs ( about 150 of them ) . i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	basically , this backpack is all that i need in a back pack . very well padded , very roomy , fits an hp pavillion dv8000 17 '' laptop . its very attractive and after a month on use shows no signs of ware and tear . definately worth the $ . unlike my previous packpacks the straps adjust so quickly and easily that i adjust them every time i put the pack on or take it off . great product ! ! !
0	i was ( wrongly ) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo . be sure your computer is supported , because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing , so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer . so amazon , as usual , graciously took it back . love amazon . i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work
0	i had no problems burning to these discs , its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore . after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them , my discs started dying after a few months . in addition , in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become . this is true for all the discs ( about 150 of them ) . i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	we love the card scanner , it 's the best . everyone who is a recruiter should have one it saves time and space
0	i just recently bought this and when i installed it norton caught 2 viruses on the install cd .
0	i bought this router hoping that some of the quality in cisco 's excellent enterprise-market routers would have worn off on adopted child linksys . unfortunately , my experience has me convinced that linksys is a red-headed stepchild ( my apologies to all you red-heads ) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent . that being said , the router does work out of the box , and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home-network routers . my perusals of the dsl reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub- $ 300 routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies , and this one is certainly no exception . pros : this router is configured to work right out of the box . you can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on , and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen . the html-based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use . you do n't have to learn one single command line to configure this router . default configuration was stealth mode -- meaning the router did not respond to _any_ unsolicited connection requests , forming a protective `` black hole '' on my ip for most uninvited packets . cons : not all of the features worked out of the box . several of the links in the html command pages simply did not link to anything . strange that linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that do n't point to anything . turning on the poorly documented `` firewall '' feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests . sometimes the router responds `` port closed '' to all requests . sometimes it responds `` port closed '' to some and `` port open '' to others ( the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next ) . never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration ( with `` firewall '' inactive ) . i 'm not sure how the `` firewall '' in this router is configured to behave , but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature . the router 's dhcp functionality works great -- when it works . it mysteriously disengages at random intervals , requiring a reboot ( and sometimes a flash to factory defaults ) to remedy . flashing a new bios image is risky ; router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer - or file13 , if the warranty is out . for what it 's worth , i am still using this router . it serves its basic purpose , and while its functionality issues are annoying , there are workarounds for all of them . i probably will not buy another linksys , but the problems with this one are n't annoying enough to warrant a return . -sean hennin
1	all of the pc to stereo cbales i could find in the stores were only 6ft long . due to the furniture arrangement in my living room , i needed a longer cable to make the connection . i was also worried about loss of sound quality over long distances . the 20 ft monster cable took care of both those issues for me . the connections are solid and the sound quality is great . it was well worth the money
1	i have just started with an apple ipod nano product and was not impressed with the factory included ear buds at all . they did n't sound real good and did n't come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears . what 's the deal with that ? next came the old sony mdr 027 head phones from the closet . the sony 's have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now . they worked o.k. , i guess , but in comparison these jbuds sound much better than either of the previous ones . i 'm now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine . i 'm hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models . crisper highs , great mid range , and responsive lows . set up was fast too , just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running . the jbuds actually stay in your ear . wow what a concept . they are also very comfortable due to the fact i forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing . the cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket . if you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie . better too much than not enough . so back to the closet with the sony . i guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks . i could n't have made a better choice for the money and quality . you should do the same . another quick note . the shipping went great . not too long at all and with standard usps . thanks amazon
0	the seam came apart and the gel leaked out in the first 6 months . the non-skid , underside surface has a peculiar and distinctly unpleasant smell
1	this phone is clear and easy to use ... have had a couple and have not been disapointe
0	i bought this for my 12 year old who so far has n't been able to get it to play . ( i have n't either ) before giving up on it , we have to retrieve the directions from his grandmother 's house and read them thoroughly . i 'm disapointed since coby 's have a good reputation
0	we had troubles fromt he start , they correct a type would not work . took to a brothers repair shop and they could not fix , need some parts.. plus when you tried to type letters you would get numbers ... it was the present my daughter wanted the most for christmas and she could not use ... very sad . so i will by another brand at a local store in town .
0	ok , so this is probably not the best protection for your ipod , but what do you want for 6 bucks ? i 'm cheap . if you 're not , buy something more expensive perhaps ... pros : - it does protect the screen and click wheel nicely . - the flip-up top magnetically shuts and holds securely , which i guess helps if you happen to drop it . cons : - the belt clip is ridiculous . it 's not a stationary clip . instead it spins around , which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater . this product is not for the joggers . - the leather strap that comes with it is too short , which makes it difficult to operate the ipod when it 's around your neck . - it seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under pros above . but , as long as you never take your ipod out of the case , no worries . - this is made for the 30 gb ipod video , but it 's actually a little big for it . it leaves room for the ipod to slide up and down in the case . it makes accessing the hold switch difficult sometimes when the flip-up top is down . it 's easier to just open the top . if you do n't care about the cons and you are cheap like me , go ahead and buy it
1	this is perfect ( so far ) and exactly what i needed . i have been looking for a new keyboard to work with my desktop , which sits right next to mu polycom conference phone . i have been looking for something that was silent and took up less desktop space . i work out of a home office when i am not on the road so i need something that works . i spend a lot of time on the phone , so i want to be able to type without everyone on the call knowing it . perfect . setup took about 15 minutes with absolutely no hitches and no issues - the first time that has happened for me with a logitech prouct . i had read these reviews and was prepared for a grueling install , but instead it happened so quickly i was right back to work fully functional . i use my hp media center as the base pc for my office and printers - the workhouse of my office , but i have a thinkpad x60 tablet in a docking station . i connect from the media center to the thinkpad using remote computing and it works like a champ new keyboard , mouse , keypad and all . this is a great keyboard , mouse , and numeric keypad combination . we will see how long the batteries last , but so far so good . a+
0	the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case ; i ca n't believe the case did n't come this way -- and that 's just the start of the problems . the dials are fussy and it 's not easy to carry this radio , even in the case , without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you have n't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station . in minneapolis-st. paul , wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown . but that station has howitzer power . forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city . granted , i did n't buy this to listen to fm or shortwave . it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball . with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco , that wo n't happen , as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins ' new am radio home , or any othe am signal in the area . that 's really difficult to imagine , being other radios i own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area . if this is an example of grundig 's work , i 'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products .
1	after 8 months of thinking , `` these ( foam inserts that came with my e3c 's ) will last forever '' i broke down and ordered these replacements as the originals were getting quite dirty . whoa ! the new ones made me realize how much my originals had hardened . my great sound and comfort was back - and the decay was so gradual i did n't even realize what i was missing ! so , 5 stars for performance , but 3 stars for what amounts to some pretty expensive foam ear plugs . avg=4stars
0	i bought two lexar thumbdrives , over other brands , partially based on their rebate offers . despite my methodical record keeping and submission , i simply got post cards saying that i did not `` meet '' the rebate requirements ( in place of the rebate checks ) . the first time it happened , i thought it was , oh well , my fault , but the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission . this is simply frank fraud by lexar , on a smaller scale , therefore not worth customers ' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further . i hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again
1	does the job nicely . i am not an audiophile so i dont get into the nit picking when it comes to speaker wire . just tell me what gauge to use and i do it . seemed high quality to me
1	we got this phone about 3 years ago . in the past month , the buttons have begun to be an issue . you can press and press a button and maybe on the 3rd try , it works . finally go another phone . as with all things today , it is n't made to last . however , the price makes it less painful to have to buy another so soon
0	comes preconfigured with a private ip address . upon changing the units ' address to match my home network it locked up and became unuseable . i sent it back . poor product . i might add that i make my living configuring networks . this is a poor product , period
1	the carry case does the job of holding my walkman and therefore i say it is worth the money . however i have found for my smaller arm it is hard to get it wrapped around in a steady position , but with some effort it does . overall i am happy with the purchase
0	i bought this product and was very disappointed by it . not only did it damage my head to my c.d . writter , it also destroyed my hard drive in the process . eri
1	plugged right in and worked like a charm . no software to configure . great buy . great product
0	but the touch wheel is harder to use . i bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it . since that point time i had a harder time turning it off/pausing , adjusting the volume , using the back and forth touch points , and setting a stop point in a audiobook . this is the result of the mini being recessed into the case . i took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again . the case will protect your mini without a doubt - but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for . also , make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since i nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip . i 'll only use when absolutely necessary now .
0	this stuff is great . my wife and i use it to label things we do n't use often so we can tell at a glance what is in a box or what a bottle contains . it goes into the labeler without a fuss and works the first time every time . the glue on the back ( once the backing is peeled ) requires the the surface be dirt and oil free or it will eventually come off . the printing will `` wear off '' if you are using it in a high friction environment such as on a book in a backpack . however , it lasts long enough that whatever it is on becomes habit and the label is no longer necessary . btw , if i did not have fingernails , i could not peel the backing off without using a large paperclip . there ought to be suggestions from brother about the best way to get the backing started off the label
0	after one successful printing it did n't work at all . my printer is hp deskjet 712c . this cable seemed to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected

0	i have purchased the card for my 3 years old toshiba laptop , which has a wireless card ( b ) so i thought it is time to go faster . i have connected to various access points with it , but for the first week i could not get it to connect to internet , so it would see the networks but it would not connect at all . after installing the latest driver i connected to internet , however even it shows a stronger signal than my laptop 's card it is very very slow.plus , it did not see some of the networks , which i could see with my laptop 's card . the tech . guys have been very kind , but their advice did not help . i am very disappointed .
1	this is just great for a single vpu video card , the cooling system works great , moving all the hot air outside the cpu . the software overclock is good too , u can change values any time u want and u can select if u want those applied for 3d games only . it works with any game , i 've tested it with oblivion at 1280x1024 , hdr enabled and every option at maximum . it works great with f.e.a.r at 1280x1024 with aax8 and ffa x 4 the price is good for a very high end video cards
0	this junk absolutley ruined an otherwise mildy scratched cd . avoid at all costs unless you want to completely destroy a cd . what was in that bottle , toilet cleaner
0	the buttons on the remote , although many , are not useful . the only button we use ( to advance or back up slides in a presentation ) was difficult to use , poorly located , unreliable . not a good selectio
1	i wish i searched , found , purchased one earlier . i 'm a road warrior with laptop . i work from home at times have a desktop . this device is awesome to plug in go . i love it . better than a clunky port replicator for my laptop saves precious desk space . i 'd highly recommend
1	great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your ipo
0	having had very good luck with two belkin g routers , i thought that the g+ would be a no-brainer . not . first of all , the router would not install at all from windows 2000 . i called customer support , and after interminable waits and two tech support people ( who were very polite ) , we finally decided to install from another computer with windows xp . all seemed to be going along fine -- the router installed -- but did not allow me to set a security password for the wireless in the regular set-up process like their g-router setups did . only when i logged on wirelessly , it let me set a password -- -- meaning had any of my bandwidth-thieving neighbors tried to log on before me , it would have been them setting my password ( which would have effectively locked me out of the wireless ! ) . it also came without a user 's guide ( though that is listed on the box contents ) and the cd-rom also was supposed to have a user 's manual , but when i clicked on the `` user manual '' tab , nothing came up ! after all was said and done , i did manage to get my xp system connected , but the windows 2000 would not connect even with a cable ( it was working fine on a linksys direct cable before ) . overall -- a very painfully long installation that was not windows 2000-compatible ( or perhaps a firewall problem ) , items left out of the package , and a big step down in ease of installation from their g router . and if that is n't bad enough -- the signal strength was no improvement over the linksys g router i was replacing . belkin , sorry -- this product was below your previous standard . this one 's going back to best buy
1	this card was easy to install and works well . i have very little experience even opening a compter box . making a spot for the connection to come out of the computer case turned out to be the most difficult part .
1	in my opinion , sony 's strength lies in its tvs . this line of lcd sets are expensive , but you 'll definitely get what you pay for . the picture quality is incredible ! the beauty of this set is also material - it is a work of art . while the internal speakers are decent , i would have been just as happy not to have them . but thanks to the beautiful design of the bezel , you do n't even know the speakers are there . some reviewers have mentioned `` lcd clouding '' , and for a product of this price it would serve you well to do the appropriate google search . but sony stands by its products , and if you receive a set that is not up to standards , they will rectify the situation . also , many reviewers are mentioning a lower-quality picture . it is important to understand what kind of signal you are feeding the tv , and what signal will give you the optimal image . not all hd signals are the same , and will provide you with varying degrees of quality . be prepared to upgrade other equipment to explore the maximum potential of this device . but , i have yet to see a signal that was n't enhanced by being viewed on this set over my previous panasonic tube set . the interchangable bezels is a nice idea , but only for those with deep ( er ) pockets . the silver set alone is beautiful , and if i had only one complaint , it would be that it 's harder to get matching sony peripherals in silver than you might think . all in all , it 's the best lcd you can buy
1	i used lexar media multi card reader in my p2120 fujitsu laptop via a usb 2 pc-card adapter . it 's truly plug-and-play without any need of drivers in windows xp
1	i received this product from an amazon.com seller for 1/2 the price of what best buy was selling it for . it was new and in an unopened box . upon opening the box i was able to tell right away that it was built very good . the hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere . i had spent over $ 300 for a runco antenna for my runco projector for local hd ( directv does not have local hd in my area ) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80 % reception with it . this antenna with a similar design the the runco model is built better and i get between 94-98 % reception depending on the channel ( directional antenna so reception varies slightly ) . i was also amazed with the fact that i not only get local channels for youngstown ohio , but i also get locals with over 60 % reception from cleveland ( direction antenna is facing ) but also pittsburgh ( which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing ) . great product and no issues with it so far . the included booster works better than the one built into my directv receiver , so i advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector ( if it has a built in hd tuner ) or tv for best results
0	i 've had this phone for approx . 9 months now , maybe longer ... and i truly do n't know how i 've stood using this dual phone system for so long . however , tonight i 've taken a giant step `` upward '' towards better quality and design with the panasonic kx-tg 5432m dual system . this dual handset is the worst i 've ever experienced in a cordless system . from the moment i set it up , the static has been atrocious . step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear . i ca n't even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person . even within six feet of the base i receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting , not only to me , but to the other person on the other end ... for they hear it too . i will never purchase another uniden product , if this is the non-quality of product they put out . i had a 2.4 mhz system that would outshine this system ... and i wish i 'd never gotten rid of it . as the title says ... if you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone , this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear . the melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep , but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head . uniden should be ashamed of this product . stepping down from the soapbox now..
1	i recently bought one of these for our 18-month-old son . the piano arrived in fine shape . the piano and bench are sturdy and well made when you put them together properly . the sound is just like i remember a toy piano should sound . notes are not perfectly in tune like a fine instrument , but tuned within reason to the notes of the scale , including sharps and flats . most importantly , our little boy just loves playing this piano . hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other toy , including the electronic toys , we have purchased for him . i also liked that he was n't able to pull off the keys try as he may . they just kind of become locked when he trys to do that and can be put back in place by minor adjstment .
0	about three years ago , maybe four , i bought two lexar cfii cards . one never worked , the other worked , but lost all data . i wrote to lexar , that i had two bad cards , they sent me one new card of the same size . i gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she did n't care about losing . i still have my card , in a ziplock . none of the file removal programs will get the images off , i 've used all of them , had their ( file removal ) tech help give up . in this day age of `` just make the item '' i am upset . but you take your chances . do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a lexar ? i would n't , i use an actual sandisk card , myself . if they ever ( lexar ) made it right , i may have written a better review , but they have n't . so that tells me that they do n't care . how important are your pictures to you ? frederic
1	i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder , because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs . i bought this lens cleaner and -- voila ! -- the recorder is working again . super easy to use ( it 's simply a dvd that you insert into your machine , and the menus tell you what to do ) . highly recommended
0	i think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine , is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder , and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax ! i especially got this machine because i thought it was a quality machine , and would n't do that , but i was wrong . sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating . i would stay away . it prints nicely , but it does n't help if it ruins your faxes . i see other reviewers have the same problem
0	i bought 2 of these drives to set up a raid1 array ( mirror ) and one of them continuously has errors , causing the array to be degraded . i called tech support and they said these drives do not support raid . big let down , i have to go for the server version which will end up costing much more
0	i was very disappointed in the lexmark p450 printer . the colors were very dull and the picture quality were definitely not up to the lexmark standards that i am used to . ( i have several lexmark products ) i returned the printer
1	what an amazing product for such a small price . it works right out of the box , but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers . the option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday pc work as well using the pen for graphics . i use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures . it really makes a difference . the unit seems well made and i like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice . i opted for the smallest in the range for value , and was not disappointed , but i am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better , but at cost . the software bundle is ok too if you do n't already have photoshop tools . the one quibble is that at home when i installed the drivers it continued to crash my pc with my wireless keyboard installed . not ideal , but as i dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me , but be careful , i am sure there will be a fix somewher
0	everything works fine except for two flaws in excel : on the numpad , the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key . this is unacceptable , i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games . logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products , but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings . i will never buy logitech again
1	my dad and i installed it in just an hour ! it was very . you ca n't beat this price . i found the same mount at best buy for over $ 200 ! ! !

0	i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer . i wasnt impressed . i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up . i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three `` processes '' without successful results . it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs . i dont think this is a good `` repairer '' of any disc thats more than mildly scratched . my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon ! ! many of my cds i have replaced for $ 7-10 bucks on here . i wish i wouldve kept my $ 25
1	mouse is comfortable to use , and i have n't had any problems with it so far . i did have some difficulty hooking it up to my computer , but once i figured out the problem it was all smooth sailing from there . it is my first wireless mouse , so i have nothing else to compare it to , but i definitely like it a lot better than my old mouse .
1	this is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl 's room ! the picture is great and hello kitty pops on screen for certain commands ( volume , channel change.. ) . my daughter age 4 loves it . i would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks ... the remote control is has so many buttons and they are very tiny , very close together . i can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also very tiny . this is annoying when in my daughter 's darkened room and i have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button ... the other thing i have to point out that bugs me is that you ca n't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode . in other words when i go to put in a dvd , i ca n't just push `` open '' . nothing will happen . you have to find the right button , choose `` dvd '' from a choice of 3-4 things , and only then will the tray slide open . all in all , these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again ... although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize ... one great thing i want to point out -- there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards ( something not all dvd players offer ) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads ... .you can ff right to the beginning of the movie ! ! !

0	hello , i purchased the avic-d2 , xm and the ipod kit from amazon . i then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup . after 3.5 hours they failed . i decided that i 'd return the items because i needed to get an alternative gift before christmas and i did n't have time to find another way to get it installed . i was able to return the d2 , but the gex-p10xmt and the ib100ii are not returnable . it turns out that amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies . had i realized that amazon would sell me something that i ca n't return i would have purchased elsewhere . at this point i will never purchase anything else from amazon ever again

1	bag is attractive and very sturdy . the computer fits securely and is well padded . i recently used it on a trip and was able to place other carry on items in it and it traveled well
0	the pros : -you can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it 's adhesive . -it allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well . -does n't prohibit any functions of the ipod ( i.e . sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on ) the cons : -bubbles , bubbles , bubbles . i 've carefully applied and re-applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways , and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime , especially on the screen . -if the screen is not lit up , all you can see is bubbles on the screen . -it does n't do the ipod justice , because it looks so cheap when applied . -after 2 days with this product i 'm already looking to replace it .
1	the best sound i 've ever heard in a radio . i also own a cambridge soundworks 730 and a bose wave cd/radio . despite the fact that this is a mono radio , its sound is incredible accurate , warm and powerful . the bass is astounding and the highs crystal clear . i agree with a report i 've read in cnet that states this is probably the best sounding radio ever made .
1	i purchased this item on march 15 from amazon . we 've been using it for almost a month now . my wife and i have built our ht system in our master bedroom ( 16x14x10 ) also have 40 '' samsung lcd 4095 ( 1080p ) and polk audio speakers ( in ceiling ) lc60i for front and middle speakers and rc60i for the surround speakers . i 'm awaiting for toshiba hd-xa2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity subwoofer with a hsu stf-2 sub . originally my first choice was a pioneer vsx-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and hdmi video pass-thru only . i did n't think it fit our needs . however , onkyo tx-sr604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations , ease of use ( very easy setup ) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound . i did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to hdmi issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and i did n't mind running extra component cable to my tv knowing it does n't up-convert component to hdmi . the only thing that i have n't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature . i 'm planning to install my extra pair rc60i in wall speakers to our master bathroom hopefully soon so ca n't comment on that part yet . overall we 're very pleased with our purchased thanks amazon !
0	nothing that uses fw400 responds to being plugged into this device , whether is it bus powered or not . bloody useles
0	i found this paper on amazon as an accessory to the olympus camedia p-400 printer . this paper does not fit the p-400 because this paper is too wide . thus , with the p-400 , this paper is useless
1	after installing the card , i booted up my windows xp and it locked up . after rebooting again , however , the card worked fine and has continued to work fine . i 've only had the card for two days , and so far i am very happy with it . here 's my setup : windows xp home edition , direct tv set-top box , and a standard cable from the set-top box into the card . since the set-top box is in the other room , i 'm just using the set-top box remote to set it on the right channel . a little tedious , but it 's fine for recording a few shows . i have n't tried the remote that came with the card ( i assume it does n't work through walls ) . the wintv 2000 software is not very user friendly , but i have n't found any bugs in it yet . i chose not to install the software and drivers from the cd . instead , i downloaded all of the latest versions directly from the manufacturer 's web site
0	i would never buy this tv again or a samsung product for that matter . i obviously purchased a lemon , have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck . samsung initially told me i would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when i called back i was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period . how 's that for sound logic . i really like it when it works , but , unfortunately , an important aspect of a tv is that you can expect to turn on when you press the power button .
0	i 've been using this remote since it was released . better than any others i 've run into , but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too , be prepared to give up a couple of hours . when it 's working , it 's a 5 star device , however ... read on as to why i give it a 2 . as i type this , my hold time is up to 45 minutes on the phone to 2nd level support . 3rd call today . i simply got a new pvr . programmed ok , but it is n't the default device when i watch tv . also , it took two calls to find out my directv pvr is not a pvr , it 's a `` satellite '' . as a `` pvr '' , it could n't be added to activities because `` you do n't have a device that will change channels '' . news to me . never known a pvr that could n't change channels . literally , 4 friggin ' hours so far and it still not right . at some point , the tv suddenly stopped turning on . 2-3 hours on that issue and it 's still not right . tv does not go on until i hit the `` help '' button on the remote . to add insult to injury , i ca n't access the website . enter my email as an id and am told it 's already in the database . i ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized . i hate that the software does n't have a simple `` home '' button . you have to go through several menus to get back to it . hold time now up to 52 minutes . i have to hang up for an appt. , so the hold has to be repeated ... .again . oh yeah ... i also dislike the size of the buttons , especially the numbers . cell phone sized . no doubt designed for a dainty child . i could go on , but if another comes out with a product like this one , i 'll be looking hard at it
0	i live in san francisco and have generally good radio reception . this unit could not receive normal fm stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up ... and i used the fancy `` dipole '' antenna on the boston accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna . the hd part of the radio is total junk . sometimes the audio `` skips '' and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired ( meaning 3 or 4 second drop-outs . ) all in all , there 's nothing good about this radio . do n't buy it .
1	i love this arm band . i have had it for about 6 months now . you dont have to take your ipod out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer . i also only use my ipod for the gym , so its nice that this arm band provides great protection ( better than ipod 's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on ) as well as not coming off while working out .
1	excellent value -- these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price . if you use a lot of aa 's , this is the way to go -- made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the $ 18 range
1	title : intuos3 tablet publisher : wacom publish date : unknown isbn/model # : ptz631w reviewer : robert saucier rating : 5 stars in 1997 , after buying a new top-of-the-line 450mhz pentium ii system , i splurged on a wacom artz ii tablet . oh , my ! pressure-sensitive , tilt-sensing , pointer control , assignable function pads ; it was heaven . after a couple of years , every time i tried to use it with my primary graphics application , my computer would spontaneously reboot -- a bit counter-productive . i watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but , as technology marched on , my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats . sadly , i disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away . lately , i 've been feeling the pull once more , that urge to use a pen to do photo touch-ups instead of my mouse . miraculously , a wacom intuos3 6-inch by 11-inch tablet dropped , almost literally , into my lap . sleek , gun-metal gray , sexy -- with a comfort-grip pen ( much like my coveted pilot g2 pens ) and a mouse ! even better , the intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities : adobe elements 4.0 , corel painter essentials 3 , and nik color efex 2.0 le . heaven just got better ! the intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution , over twice that of the wacom graphire product line , and , with its usb 2 connection , there 's more than enough communication bandwidth , meaning better tablet to application response . one hesitation i have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system ; will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else . the intuos3 driver has been rock-solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me . i 've used all of my `` usual '' programs and have had no problems at all . the tablet has also been peacefully co-existing with two external drives , a wireless desktop receiver , a card reader , a scanner , and a printer , all riding the same usb bus . the intuos3 has 8 `` chordable '' buttons , 4 at each side of the tablet , to which keys , macros , or other actions may be assigned . the default for each group are the usual alt , ctrl/command , and shift , along with `` space '' . the placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet , holding one or more of the buttons , while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand . being chordable , you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like alt-ctrl-s or to the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well . the default setting is to scroll or depending on the context . the ends of the strip , in keystroke mode , can be set to playback macros . the pen , with its 1024-level pressure-sensitive stylus and `` eraser , '' also has a duoswitch . the duoswitch 's two positions may also be programmed . the pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib -- there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback . with the ergonomic grip , the pen is extremely comfortable to hold . the 5-button mouse , designed to be used by either `` righties '' or `` lefties , '' is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility , this is more than acceptable . as with every other clickable/pressable feature associated with the intuos3 , the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options , although i 've yet to find the `` fix photo , '' `` illustrate article , '' or even the `` design website '' settings . i can see only two very minor changes that i would make to this fantastic product . i would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen . it is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already , this feature would be the feather on the cap to me . the other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the graphire ( and was on the artz ii ) . sometimes , having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time . for the casual home user , i would recommend the graphire product line -- this intuos3 model 's srp of $ 369 may be a bit high where a $ 99 entry point on the graphire is more affordable . for the pro-consumer or professional , however , whether doing photo editing ( my primary use ) or illustration , the intuos3 line is well worth the investment . it 's great to be in heaven again ...
1	this is a surprisingly good radio at this price . it is small , compact and yet very robust and quite heavy . it is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store . here are three things i really liked about this product : 1 ) the am/fm reception is outstanding . i am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear . listening to fm on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure . 2 ) the buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function . this is something sangean seems to get very well . 3 ) the multi-level display lighting can be turned off , or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright . a few things i did n't like . the pilot light for `` on '' is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night . i had to put black electrical tape over it . the aux input is a mini-jack instead of rca connector . minor inconvenience here . and finally , the cabinet is nice wood , but the finish is not as good as i think it could be . this radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than i expected for this price . it 's a keeper
0	i 've purchased and attempted to install three of these adapters . one of them was on an older dell laptop , installed without any problems at all and connected seamlessly to a linksys wrt54g router with wap encryption . the problems really started showing when i tried to install the second and third adapters , both on desktop computers running windows xp sp2 . the software installation was a breeze , but when i plugged in the adapter - nothing happened . connect to network ... which network ? scan..who ? what ? it looks like this adapter has a very , very short range and does n't work very well a wall or two in between the routers . it would see the router and connect - to drop the connection and not find one . but then it would find it again , and on and off . never really worked as expected on the desktops , so i 've given up . i 've had to disconnect them and reconnect them multiple times . downloaded the updated software from belkin 's site , and still have connection issues with the desktops . the laptop works fine as long as i do n't take it one room away from the router . avoid at all costs please . i 've used other wireless devices with the same router that i 'm trying to connect and they work fine - a few rooms away and all . spend a few more dollars and get something worth the money spent . spend less time troubleshooting and more time surfing . good luck
0	this was my second netgear product i bought ( previously a wireless modem which i was only okay with not impressed ) the idea of a network storage appeals to me . but this drive just is not good . in reading the previous reviews i found that it was a finicky thing , and be careful on the drives you buy for it . well i searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday . tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well , but that is where everything started to go down hill . midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages ( which turn out to be things like this is untested on xp and might not work kind of errors ) and suddenly my computer reboots . figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well , and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot . tried again , same thing happens . started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the sc101 , you need to look in to your own computer . to quote netgears web site , `` scsi disk drivers from the promise company conflict with the sc101 device drivers . promise drivers are typically used for raid 1 or for sata drives . many newer computers use promise sata drivers . '' my computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers . back in the box the sc101 goes , and i try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me . tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests , and none work . this is where i get really frustrated , netgear support . i waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone , who ultimately told me it was my own fault and i 'd have to pay to have that `` cr*p '' , yes he said it , from my system . i needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill . i have to pay to get this junk off my computer . way to support your products netgear . the tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand , and went through huge mood swings during the call , from happy , to argumentative , to depressed , to happy again . i was freaked that this person knew my home address ! all in all , this is a great concept . after reading up on it and now experiencing it , i think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market . maybe by a company with better customer service . it really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
1	the only thing i will say about the bdp-s1 is that it is top quality . picture and sound quality are top-notch , but everything really depends on the software . now , if you are undecided about which camp to follow ( blu-ray or hd dvd ) , i 'm here to tell you that blu-ray will win . you see , i have both blu-ray and hd dvd . i have about 20 hd dvd movies and about 20 blu-ray movies . in terms of picture and sound quality , they are the same , but it is completely dependant on the software . but here is where the similarities end . 1 ) blu-ray is more durable . the bd movie discs have scratch-resistant coating . they do n't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them . on the other hand , the hddvd movies scratch like heck . i put all of my movies in a cd case . i recently noticed that all the hddvd movies are scratched , but none of the blu-ray movies are scratched . these are stored in the same cd case by me . i am extremely careful . none of my movies even have a fingerprint on them . so when i see scratches on 100 % of my hddvd movies , that really upsets me ! ! ! ! ! 2 ) blu-ray costs less to buy . what ? superman returns bd is $ 24 , superman hddvd is $ 28 . the departed bd is $ 24 , the departed hddvd is $ 28 . now the hddvd dual format has both a standard dvd and hddvd movie , but who in their right mind would want to buy an hddvd to watch a 480p picture ? right now you can get a $ 500 ps3 or $ 400 toshiba hddvd player . later this year , sony will come out with a $ 300 blu-ray disc player . hddvd will most likely drop their prices . so the hardware will cost the same in both formats . 3 ) blu-ray has more capacity . for less money , you can get a 50gb blu-ray movie versus a 30gb hddvd movie . and what if in 5 years they develope super high-definition 1920p picture and super hi-def 8.1 dts-hd sound ? what if this requires 75gb or 100gb ? hddvd can go up to 51gb . peace .
1	we have the original itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in . the originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station . after reading the instructions i plugged the new itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals . not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away . that is better than i expected after reading all the feedback . i 'm not sure what everyones problem is . it 's not a radio tower , it 's a transmitter the size of your finger . i get the feeling that some people think it should power the city block .
0	at first i loved the compact iaudio player , but after the first week , the earphone input ( hole in the player ) , did n't hold the input jack securely , resulting in no sound . i could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second , but could not get it to work continuously . unfortunately , i threw away my receipt and box , or i would return it
1	the klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long . i researched dockable ipod / mp3 players for a few months before i decided on this one for my wife 's office . i 'm fussy when it comes to quality audio equipment , the i-grove does not disappoint . it provides room filling sound with no distorion . i listened to it extensively before wrapping it up for xmas to make sure it had the quality i insist on . it delivered . another bonus with the klipsch is it 's ability to accomodate other mp3 players and / or personal compact disc players . i 'm completely satisfied with my purchase of the klipsch i-groove .
0	purchased a total of 20 of these . i previously sold the american international brand sirius antenna but there was a temporary shortage in the market . four of the twenty terk brand units were dead on installation . sadly , i thought terk was a quality brand . my mistake !
0	i bought this to record tivo dvr stuff to dvd . worst frame rate capture and audio capture of .avi 's of the four different devices i have tried . completely unusable . the software is a trial version . instead , buy the ads dvdxpress dx2 for a bit more . ulead 's software is stable , and it 's not a trial version . it is also the only analog capture device i have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture . pinnacle 's dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space , but the software is way too buggy
0	no kidding ! ! the shipping charge on these batteries was over $ 6.00 . amazon does n't itemize the shipping charges on your order , so if you order multiple items , you wo n't know that you 're being raped by crutchfield until it is too late !
1	i agree that these are not top of the line . but they are n't bad at all . i get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media . i always burn at half the speed the media is designed for - 2x in this case . it takes longer , but i get good results . i am rarely in a hurry to burn a dvd . i would buy these again . ** updated on 7/3/2005 ** i have bought a new computer recently and i have been burning these dvds with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what-so-ever . very happy with this product
1	compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special cf 's with extended bases . other than that , it ca n't be beat for the price and quality . adorama rocks
0	the use of this ac power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless . on battery the radio works very well , just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost . invest in batteries rather than this product .
1	i love this product . the earbuds were even better than i had expected . i wanted something small that would n't hurt my ears and i wanted a long cord and that is just what i got . i am very happy with the product and the service . thank yo
0	i was looking for a small cheap mp3 player and i did n't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me . i saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so i decided to buy it . when i got the creative nano i was really happy with its preformance until i tried to put my subscription music onto it . thats when i learned that it would n't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money . after that i started realising all of its imperfections . you ca n't use the fm radio in the car without hearing mostly static . you ca n't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to . do n't get me wrong , there are some good sides to this mp3 player but i still would definately not recommend it
0	if they were n't free , i 'd give them 1 star . media code : mcc 01rg20 . 2 of 10 were coasters at 4x with my dvdrw ide1008
1	these phones are great . sound quality is very good , including the speaker phone option . phones have many handy features , and all features are intuitive to use . no problem with the range . very easy to set up . battery life has proven to be no concern so far . the phones feel comfortable in the hand . i could n't be happier
1	sent quickly and nicely packaged . these will do the job for those desiring a shorter recording program
1	everything about the sonos worked as advertised . it was a snap to set up and it is slicker than i anticipated . the interface is commonsense and well thought out . it is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously . you can also play different music , all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio . it is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises
1	totally agree with the other reviewers ' comments . originally , i was going to buy canon 's adapter for my powershot a640 not realizing it was plastic ! ! plus , even with shipping , this is still cheaper ( by 5 bucks ) and its metal ! fyi -- if you do n't have any filters ( like i did n't ) get tiffens 3 filter set 52mm ( circular polarizer , uv protector , and 812-warming len ) a good buy for the price -- i bought it because of the reviewers ' comments and do n't regret it
1	product performs per specifications and is easy to use . would like to see fuse easier to replace
0	sony advertised this as a 18x burner for dvd+r media . i used the recommended brand ( verbatim ) and taiko-yuden which are very high end media . i was only backing up home movies from my panasonic camcorder . the movies are in .mpeg format , i was only writing data and it should be no problem for any writter . unfortunately , i got only 12x write speed with the provided software , in a mac as well as in a pc . ( just slower than advertised , no clusters ) . it is a noisy drive too . i spoke with sony costumer service and i could not get any satisfactory answers . i had to wait a long time to be helped . they said that the drive was probably damaged . i returned it and i do not think the drive quality or the customer support represents the price of this drive .
0	i suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive . even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room . the sound is so-so and it has no battery backup , lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing . it is also very big , taking up 1/2 my nightstand . the final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where i live . this morning i finally gave in , accepted reality and tossed it in the trash . i wo n't miss it at all
1	i enjoy this mouse . usually , i do n't like using the touch pad on laptops but after deciding to buy a mouse , i had to look for a specific mouse that would fit into my lifestyle as a student . i have small hands and i hate carrying out heavy objects in my bookbag . since i have to lug my laptop around , i needed a mouse that did n't take a lot of space , is good enough to withstand constant shifting in my laptop , and that worked well with my needs . pros : small size , optical , scrolling tab , and portability cons : sometimes the mouse jumps around a bit on its own . but this happens only a few times every few weeks - so it 's not often enough to cause a problem for me . enjoy
1	buy it and you will not live home without it . if i would rate this product , i will rated a 6 stars .
1	works well , especially for anyone who still has their old console systems in use . i have my nes and snes , both of which have huge ac adapters , plugged into this . it saves tons of space on my power strip . the design is a little clumsy though , so it 's only getting 4/5
0	these xtreme cd cases stinks , literally ! i do n't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic , but the smell is absolutely nauseous . i kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away . nope . finally i threw it away . other than the smell , quality-wise it is ok .
0	this media did not work on my brand new asus burner , even after updating the firmware
1	this is an awesome little device . let me start with the pros : 1 ) easy : incredibly easy setup ( literally press one button - never believed it , but it 's true . plug in the usb transmitter , press the blue button voila . ) 2 ) good sound : for a small set of speakers , these things sound great . they are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system , but sound very good and comparable to a $ 45 two-speaker set of monitor-side speakers . there 's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well . 3 ) wireless range : with 4 aa batteries , you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house . reception is great . i am used to bluetooth headsets that do n't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - i had doubts about bluetooth speakers , but i am amazed with reception these guys have . 4 ) controls : the forward , reverse pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both media player or yahoo music engine running on the laptop ( the only two i tried ) . again , i was surprised , but they worked flawlessly . 5 ) cool : as far as cool factor , this little guy is definitely that . cons : 1 ) no remote : it would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound , ff , rw , pause , play controls . 2 ) no control from pc : you ca n't control the sound ( or mute ) from the laptop - only from the speakers . 3 ) sound : above i said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system . however , these are small speakers and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too . it 's good , but it 's not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system . there is base but not a great deal - you definitely wo n't feel the music with these speakers . 4 ) volume : volume is limited - it 's enough to fill a mid-sized room , but not much more . for $ 100 , this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with no wires . carry it to your kid 's room . to the garage . to the basement . no wires , nothing . if convenience is and portability is important to you , and if medium sound quality is ok , then i would highly recommend this speaker system . it 's great . personally , i 'm not sure if i 'm going to keep them because i would really like fuller sound ( this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room ) and more base - but they 're so cool and convenient , that i doubt i 'll be able to give them up ! for other bluetooth ideas and wi-fi network options , see my post at the hydrogen audio forum : [ ... ]
1	it costs 30 % - 40 % less than the canon la-dc58f conversion lens adapter and it 's metal , not plastic ... need to say more
1	i use the memory card in my samsung d807 phone . works perfecty
0	this is a piece of junk holy cow is it cruddy do n't even call it a guitar because its not its a bad thing to call it a guitar holy crud `` where 's the tylenol !
0	there 's a reason this thing is only 6 bucks . it 's absolute junk . i put it into the cassette player in my car , and the sounds were completely distorted . the voice constantly skips , and the casette sometimes clicks . the quality of sound in my car is usually amazing , and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device . i 've tried both sides , but still no avail . i plan on returning it if shipping does n't cost more than the product itself
0	i 'm sure this product is fine . but do n't order it through amazon , through ritz camera . they just cancelled my order without warning , having listed that the bag was available . freaking idiots
1	what i ordered - on time delivery - good price
0	we bought this machine for a christmas present for the inlaws , knowing i 'd wind up installing it . the first disk played fine , but while i was eating lunch my father-in-law tried moving to a different cd . it would n't play . it 'd go back to the first disk and play it fine . so , i shut it down , restarted on disk 2 and now it played fine , but would n't go back and play disk 1 ! i moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an old-fashioned vinyl record with a scratch . both cds worked fine in another player . in the meantime , mother-in-law is busy putting her collection of cds into groups for me to program . not this holiday season . this sucker 's going back to the big box store from wence it came !
1	this arm-band is surprisingly good . i initially got it for my boyfriend for his iriver , but i was afraid it would n't fit his arms since he 's very muscular . surprisingly - it stretched enough and was n't tight ! he loves it . i thought there might be too much motion on mine when i run or use the eliptical , but no , it 's fine
1	outstanding cleaner for your cd or cdrw , mp3 player . takes you through many diagnostic tests . even has a dolby test . well worth the money and you will be more than pleased with it . i used it on both my pc cd and cdrw drives as well as my stereo cd player . fantastic product ! !
0	i was impressed with this controller at first , and found it to feel comfortable , and work well . it was played with once and a while for about a month ( total 10 hours max ) . some time after that , the next time i went to use it , it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick . i could not get it to center ( or even stay still ) , it would just keep either steering the car ( like burnout3 ) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what . i tried it several times , and it has never worked since . i fire it up once and a while to see if it 's still doing it , and it does . i am very dissapointed in this , and i was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the logitech controller . i think i paid about $ 45 locally for it , and i just bought a pelican extreme edge from radio shack on clearance for $ 19.99 that works and feels as good , but is less than half the cost . i do n't really feel like going thru a warranty claim , if it 's even covered , but it still annoys me every time i look at it in my xbox 'drawer ' of extra stuff . i was going to go totally wireless ( 4 units ) and luckily did n't run out and buy 3 more of these logitech controllers . i instead bought some extra microsoft s controllers , as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there . if the pelican holds up , ( model pl-2050 version 2.0 ) i might go get some more if i can find them locally .
0	these are $ 10 headphones . there 's nothing amazing about them in my opinion . i bought them to use with my ipod when i 'm out , or at work . right out of the box , i was disappointed with the fit , and i know everyone is going to be different , but for me they just are n't comfortable . the sound quality is clear , but very thin and lacking bass . even when i 'm pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit , the bass just is n't good . eq settings to boost the bass do n't help either , and often reduce sound quality even more . the ear clips do n't really seem to do that much either . they kind of keep them on your ears but do n't really hold them in your ears at all . the ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well . in summary , i would n't recommend these for music , but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word , they might be good-if you can tolerate them in your ears for that long
1	i agree with the prior review of these jbl e10s , however i 'd go to the e20s for a small room main stereo set -- better bass worth the slight price increase . bought for rear channel ( rc ) use , i find the e10s quite `` airy '' , with what seems like a better high frequency response than the main e30s i just bought from a'.com ( see my 5 star review ) , giving extremely open and detailed `` surround '' rc performance . note : the specs listed on a'.com for the e10s state `` bi-wireable : yes '' but ... unless jbl has just changed the terminals to do this that 's wrong -- mine have just a single terminal set , and do n't bother with the pricey speaker mounts offered as accessories ( unless you plan ceiling installs ) as they come with two `` slide down '' screw slots attached to the back for wall installation . surfing for the best price , i bought mine refurbished from [ ... ] for a low $ 53.00 bid plus $ 18.00 s+h directly from jbl and you may find the e30s/e20s from jbl as refurbs there as well . as rc speakers -- especially at the price i got them -- i recommend them highly , well deserving the 5 star rating given
1	i am extrememly happy with this one . for the price , it delivers well . the voice recorder works well . my key need was to record lectures and listening to them . worked out very well
0	300-500 yards under the best conditions . given its heft , a waste of mone
0	this is not an xd to compactflash card adapter . if you order this item number , you will receive a pc card adapter that accepts xd picture cards and smartmedia cards and fits your pcmia 2.1 slot on a pc or mac . it is not for a camera or substitute for a compactflash card . there is nothing compact flash about it . the product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon 's website
1	this is exactly what i was looking for : not too expensive , not much hassle with the cables - they are integrated with the unit , and no need to reach for the button to switch computers - simply press `` scroll lock '' twice to go from one computer to the other . cables are pretty long , which is good : longer that i need at the moment , but i may appreciate the extra length in the future .
1	just remember to use the proper cable , cat 5e or cat 6
0	i agree with the other review , sony brand vhs tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years . as a almost life long user of sony premium grade tapes , i have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality i get when i record , even off my dish . the picture is never up to snuff with what i see when i watch the show as it is being recorded . for the past two years , i have been able to notice the differences when i am watching something on a sony tape , the flaws have become to big to ignore . i will be buying tdk from now on , and i suggest you do the same . sony used to make a great vhs tape , but i guess they are concentrating now on making more playstations
0	consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions . cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing . ( as a non-techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are , but alas , i bought a samsung dlp ) expect these to fail within 1-2 years . expect to pay approx $ 400 to replace the color wheel and $ 200 to replace the colling fan . that is , if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere . these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates . you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized . many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years , and some more often than that . the lamp costs approx $ 150- $ 250 depending on your model , but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty . this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan . please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring , and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years . while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp , my color wheel failed very early . i called tech support to report a grinding noise , and was told to `` turn it off '' , wait 15 minutes , and turn it back on like this would fix the problem . after doing this for a while , the color wheel finally failed , actually shattered ! now i am out of warranty , and samsung wants nothing to do with me . i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors , and they are both backordered indefinitely ! it has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available . samsung can not even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand . i have had my tv for 18 months , and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time ! i have a 42 '' samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26 '' crt . both are wonderful products , but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them . dlp is a great bargain up front , but a maintenance nightmare ! you will pay in the long run , and by the long run i mean every 2 years . if you still want to purchase a dlp television , please buy the extended warranty ! it will save you a ton , but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months ! i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector , and focus on their beautiful plasma line . expect dlp prices to drop even further , but please ... look before you leap
0	i bought these head phones because i read all the reviews that gave it 4 's and 5 's , so i expected a lot out of them . the truth is you really should n't ... they do n't sound particularly awesome and i was rather disappointed that i actually spent close to $ 30.00 after shipping and stuff . the mid-highs and highs sound fine , but i had issues with bass and mid-low response , especially when i plugged it into my computer . plus they are not super comfortable either ; the hinges nip at your neck when you do n't have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses . all in all , i wished i had spent my money on something else . but they do look pretty cool .
1	this card works exactly as stated by startech . i bought two - one for a pc and one for a mac , popped 'em in and plugged in ipods , external hardrives , a scanner , and digital cameras and the cards worked perfectly . the pc needed a quick setup and the mac worked instantly ! and all at a great price ! ca n't figger out why you guys are having trouble
0	the product does not work in my view . i have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95 % of the cases . it is not much different than entering the information manually . the character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective . does not even recognize that `` wireless '' is the mobile phone number . one would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years . the only good thing is once you scan the cards , you can throw them away , but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand .
1	i do n't understand the 1 star reviews , unless there is some product variability . price was $ 60 at target . talk time is ok , although the longest i have been on the phone is maybe 10 or 15 minutes . range is fine . phone works all over the house , and audio quality if fine
0	we wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom . the reason i give two stars is because of beach camera 's return policy . they grudgingly allowed me to return it , as a one-time courtesy with a restocking fee . i wish amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company
1	the pro and cons described by other reviews are valid . i was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette , mp3 , cd and radio capability . so did n't have much of an option but to get this one . i am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality . overall i think its a good buy .
1	we used this remote to program a sony av-rm3000 remote , but we need more flexibility for our htpc . in hindsight , we should have bought a stand-alone ir unit and something like the girder software . or , maybe just an ir wireless keyboard . this is not a remote for those seeking flexibility , or those who like to customize their media experience . this is an excellent remote for those who want out-of-the-box usability , and do n't want to bother with customization . it 's well-built , and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for . pros : comfortable shape , sensible layout , high-quality feel , reasonably compatible with many programs cons : does n't do absolutely everything in every compatible application , only four somewhat-programmable keys with limited option
0	they totally misrepresent this product . it does not work with macs . i feel cheated and lied to by memorex , shame on you
0	i have the luxury of writing this review a little bit further out in the technology cycle than most of the others , so i can say : just get yourself a better wireless router . based on the reviews here , several online fora , and my own personal experience , i can confirm to you that you have about a 30 % chance of actually getting this to work , and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another . but why bother ? at this point , there are higher-power routers , high-gain directional antennae , and there are even products sporting 802.11n , which inherently has a better range that -a , -b , or -g. if you 've gotten into a situation where your router is inadequate for your needs , research and get yourself a top-notch router with good broadcast power -- i would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate router by trying to add this product to your network . i understand that my suggestion may be more expensive , but i am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth . definitely hours ( if , by some miracle , everything works on the 12th or 13th try ) , and probably a couple of days ( assuming that after 24 or 25 tries you send back the first one and try again with a new one )
0	i just got it and am fighting my way through getting it to work in vista ultimate . it claims to have a qam tuner , but i 'll be damned if it can find any digital/hd channels on my cable . my qam tv gets many . very disappointed , documentation is at best lacking . look elsewhere .
0	tilting the foot rest back and forth is not the easiest thing in the world . it 's just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot . mine broke in 2 different spots within a month..
0	got it in december ; cd player stopped working in april and now the radio reception is so bad i 'm tossing it . ca n't provide paperwork for refund as it was a gift
1	the lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease . product is easy to use and understand . for the money a great purchase .
0	i connected all the cables as instructed , but it does n't work , the light is not on . so i return it to amazon
1	i just recently bought a sub-woofer and i spent a good deal of time searching for an interconnect . the interconnects i looked at ranged from ridiculously over-priced to questionably cheap . i knew i wanted it to be thx certified and of a length that would allow me some freedom of sub-woofer placement . this interconnect provided both at a very reasonable price . i must say after installing my subwoofer that this cable was a perfect choice . some might say that the cost reflects a cables ability to provide good sound . wrong . this is just as good as those 70 dollar interconnects . i do buy monster cable for most of my home theatre needs , but i do not buy into some of the hype surrounding monster cable and their more expensive cables . why only 4 and not 5 stars . i did not like the way the cable was packaged . the cable was folded down the middle and now the center of the cable has a crook in it . i would have perfered it to be wound around a plastic spool to avoid folding of the cable . getting past that , its a good interconnect that produces great sound .
1	i 've owned and use the sony 256mb memory stick pro pictured ( in black ) , and currently also use a 1gb sony memory stick pro . i 've not had any problems with them , formatting or otherwise , over long periods of heavy use . ok , a little pricier than , say , sd cards , but a good quality product for sony digital cameras .
0	i 've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row . i 've spent hours with this product on several machines and i can now say the hardware sucks .
1	things that i like : ( 1 ) the option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable . i was a skeptic about it before i purchased it , but really do like it . also , this is the first keyboard that i have used that allows for so many typing angles . ( 2 ) the included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard . even if you do n't have windows vista , you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs . ( 3 ) the keyboard has no lag for me , whatsoever . ( 4 ) i 'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys , etc . ( 5 ) this is a small change , but i 'm using this setup on dell inspiron 6000 laptop . the software replaced the large volume notifications ( onscreen display showing volume level , mute , etc . ) with a smaller more attractive style notification . me gusta . ( 6 ) the curved keyboard is also comfortable . it requires no time nor effort getting used to it . ( 7 ) i have n't had any problems with the keyboard being `` out of range . '' ( 8 ) for the mouse , i 'm switching from the wireless intellimouse explorer 3.0 , which is also made by microsoft , to the laser 6000 mouse included . this new mouse is more comfortable . ( not a huge difference , but noticeable . ) it is also lighter , and slides around with little effort . what i do n't like : ( 1 ) the lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'start ' then 'log off windows . ' i would have liked the option to change the key to the shut down / hibernate dialog instead . i have n't found that option available , so far . ( 2 ) the keyboard is a little bit wider than others , but i do n't find it to be a problem . it 's just different . having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width . five stars
1	below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks . pros : -- -- - 1 . amazing sound especially when watching dvd movies 2 . very good progessive scan dvd picture quality 3 . simple , compact and all-in-one design 4 . remote control can work with various tv 's , cable boxes and vcr 's 5 . can play both ntsc and pal dvd 's cons : -- -- - 1 . expensive 2 . no hdmi output 3 . non-intuative remote control 4 . no headphone jack overall , i love and chose the bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design . i got this system because i wanted a compact all-in-one media center and i was not interested in getting a htib with 5 speakers . i looked at denon ( 2 products ) , sony and samsung . i use this on my 23 '' samsung lcd tv using monster component video cables and while i would have preferred to take advatange of its hdmi capabilties , the reality is that i am very happy with this image quality . movies such as lord of the rings , the matrix and hero look and sound fantastic . prior to this i was looking at the sony dav-x1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich . however the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me . for example , my pal dvds can not be played on the sony whereas on the bose it was no problem . i am of the opinion that sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products . to be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their truespace 2.1 surround sound feature . my couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me . according to bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the tv . sometimes truespace works and sometimes i ca n't hear it . i believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other . if surround sound is really that important to you , then you should get a 5.1 system . this product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3d sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room . the audio quality from music cd 's is very good and while i wish this had an ipod port as found on the denon , i am very content using the aux port
1	i bought this memory card for my camera sd500 . at first , i was very dispointed when i only see 1gb on my laptop . after googled around , i realized i need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb . i 'm able to see full 2gb after driver update . just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first
0	you 'll end up looking for something better . sound fidelity is pretty bad .
0	not very happy with this product . the software on the pc side does n't work well at all . wo n't list all my files and i ca n't get it to update changes or new folders . this bugger has way to big of a foot print . the remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies . hey i have a xbox with xbmc on it . get a clue , and copy some of it 's functionality . it continues to blow away any of the media players i have purchased
1	the wireless lavalier microphone system is perfect for informational interviewing and personal media management . it provides a portable option to amplified audient properties and gives the user a greater degree of movement during presentations . it can be used as a binary system , ( two separate microphone systems and a small amplifier are needed ) to interview your favorite personality , take testimonials or to exchange opinions with local leaders . the wireless lavalier makes the idea addition to any media kit
0	after purchasing the item in december 2006 it didnt take even a week before the troubles started , it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data . at one point , ( after two weeks ) i lost all my data . despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing . since then i am struggling with creative technical support team as there is advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website ( which both is not been of much help ) this player hasnt been much of use to me yet and i deeply regret having paid 360 usd . i gave it 2 stars because i was able to watch 2 movies while waiting at the airport and travelling , this was quite a pleasure
1	this tv/monitor rocks ! ! i 've been looking for a combo computer monitor and tv that i could use in my office . this lcd does both very well . i 'm writing this review with the lns4696d installed and everything on the screen is very large ( what i wanted ) even at 1600x1200 and the resolution is far better than i expected ! ! ( hint : sharpen the image and set high energy saving mode )
1	like the name suggests , the m-audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles . i have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money . the audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion . i connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my harman kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear . the one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first . however , when quality is essential go with the audiophile 2496 .
0	i 'm not the most gadget inclined person , and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use . but i have to say i 've had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out - it 's either off or on , but there 's not much gradation between the two . in fact i get almost no gain at all until i reach almost the `` 3:00 '' position on the dial . and then it 's a lot , and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation . it basically keeps me locked into soft , close singing , and a girl ca n't do that all the time ! other than that i have n't had any problems , but that one almost renders it useless . i do n't know if there 's something more reliable ( and sane ) out there , but if there is , go for that instead . even if it costs more . why spend money on something that does n't work
0	please do n't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised ! to date , i 've been denied twice . the second time they said the u p c number was invalid . only , it 's the original u p c barcode ! i was meticulous filing the paperwork , yet they state , `` all required products were not submitted . '' meanwhile , i have phoned amaz0n to lodge a formal complaint . the product itself is average . i 've used better and worse . that said , it 's definitely not worth the full asking price
0	when it works it does extend the range . however , every time you turn off a wirelessly connected pc and turn it on again , the pc is not assigned an ip number . unplug this extender , and the pc is assigned an ip number by the router without any problem . a brief power blackout will cut ip numbers to your wirelessly-connected pcs . i purchased this particular d-link range extender because i wanted to ensure that it works well with my di-624 router . i wasted my money buying this device . it 's useless , and it 's too light to even serve as a door stop..
0	issue solved ! i returned the harmony for a full refund . all thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team . after screwing up everything on christmas day ( it was a christmas present ) ) , your support staff said `` level 2 '' would contact me within 24 hours . after waiting 72 hours , i called `` support '' again yesterday . after waiting 30 minutes , i finally got to speak with a real-live agent who `` could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor 's approval . '' this was after providing the incident number . that took another 15 minutes . i then waited another 30 minutes ( total now 1:15 ) before i had to leave . i tried again several hours later . after being told `` level 2 was not available . '' i hung up and immediately returned my harmony to ... . thanks , logitech . -keit
1	i purchased this as a gift for my 56-year-old mother who simply ca n't get enough scrabble with her friends . while i did not get the opportunity to use the product myself , she seems quite enthusiastic about its abilities . just make sure your opponents approve and dont think you are trying to cheat .

0	wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the iogear gic251u 5-port usb card on a dell optiplex gx-1 running 98se . ( this computer already has 2 usb 1.1 ports . ) the main problem is that the add hardware wizard does not find a *.inf file in the iogear-supplied cd folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the cd folder . user has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program . this results in installation of drivers that show up in the device manager . however , the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going . installed card seemed to work ok for a d-link wireless adapter , but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-iogear 1.1 ports . the following actions did not help . ( 1 ) swapping the card to another pci slot , ( 2 ) downloading and installing more recent driver file from iogear website , ( 3 ) three calls to customer support , where i found sympathy but so solution
1	this cartridge is very light , easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality , durable black ink on the page . it is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that 's great ! ( it even comes with an expiration date ! ) hp also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit . one thing that i did n't like , however , is that the ink can go quickly . if you print a lot , you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so . my needs are about 20 pages per week and i have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks . that 's not good ; although to be fair to this hp ink cartridge i am printing graphics . four stars ( well , maybe three and one half stars ) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge . it loses points for not lasting longer .
0	i purchased a sony 5-disk cd changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks . this model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time . what were they thinking ? the ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs. a single disk cd/dvd player . this baby is going back
1	first off ... i like this unit . it 's easy to use , and it does a fine job of taking your old lps and making cds out of them . all you need to do is place a blank audio cd into the deck ( it does n't work with regular data cds ) , hit the phono/aux button , followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the lp ... take it out of pause . it starts recording instantly . between each song , hit a button and it break the recording into tracks . pretty cool ! it 's got great potential , but there are still a few shortcomings . for example , i was surprised to see that it does n't let you record off of the radio . just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner was n't digital . it 's a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations . you turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago . i would n't mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets . this also makes the remote control somewhat useless too . oddly , the remote does have an am/fm button . they should just label it the `` radio '' button , because when you think of it , switching from am to fm or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re-tune the station too , using the dial . another key point is that the unit does n't have any outputs at all . so you ca n't pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers . i would rate this as 3.5 stars , but since we ca n't use half stars , i 'll give it 4 for one big reason ... . for all it 's shortcomings , it works , and there are very few alternatives . speaking of alternatives , here are a few other options . 1 . a standalone cd-recorder . i have one of these too . the advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck . in my case , my stand alone unit has two drives , so not only can i record from any source in my system , but i can dub from one drive to the other . also , my deck can make mp3 cds from regular cds ( it 's easier than using a pc , however the song titles are just numbers ) . in my case , i opted not to use this for my lp projects , because i no longer have a turntable . i decided that as long as i needed a new turntable , i might as well pay a bit more for this unit . 2 . crosley makes a simuilar unit , but it costs a bit more and the reviews i read seemed to point out that although it looks better , the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot . 3 . a portable digital recorder like the ikey plus . i found one of these a few weeks ago and i love it . you plug your turntable or other external source into it ... plug a usb storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality ( .wav vs several mp3 sampling rates ) ... viola ! it records directly to your flash drive , ipod or external hard drive . if you do go that route , make sure you get the `` plus '' model . the older model is outdated and does n't work as well . 4 . use a pc . even though it will give you the best possible sound and options , it 's out of the question for me because i do not want to move my pc near my stereo every time i want to make a recording , nor do i want to move my stereo next to my pc ... or bog it down while i 'm trying to use it for that matter . keep in mind that if you record your cds using one of the stand alone decks , you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the cds you made into a pc afterwards , then filtering the files with your favorite audio software , then re-burn the files to cd or mp3 .
0	i have not been able to get this to work again . it was great for the first week , then it made my computer crash and now i can not get it installed again . i am not sure i like that
0	i bought this product to help cleaning the lense of my auto cd player . i tried it for at least 10 times , but no luck . wet clean the lense manually is the best way , but that will include getting the player out from the dash board
0	do not by this product . it has several issues . go to the forums on the linksys website and see for yourself . most people , myself included , have problems with the cable modem crashing and requiring a reset on a regular basis . this device also has firewall issues that cause problems with the wii and xbox360 . it 's spi firewall component is at fault and can not be disabled without turning off the entire firewall . even in the face of the number of users having problems linksys has never released a firmware update and it does n't appear that they will
0	i bought this last christmas for my three year old and five year old . thesound of the piano is a little off , but all in all the piano is nice for the price . the leg of the stool breaks very easily . do n't buy unless you can fix
0	it was a great product when it worked . sleek design , super user friendly , sharp image and easily unlock to all region . never had any problem loading or playing until last week . went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie . swallowed the dvd with it . it would 've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least
1	i purchased the lj3390 to replace an existing lj3320 . the $ 350 rebate available until the end of oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase . my main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer . duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the lj3390 over the lj3052 . i now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully . all run xp sp2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection . software installation went flawlessly . while i ca n't comment about hp versus other vendor software , i can say that the lj3390 software is a major improvement over that of my lj3320 . scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2x , quite likely more like 3-4x . printing of complex pages is also much faster , exactly what i would expect from a newer generation print engine and an hp laserjet printer . all in all i am very pleased that i upgraded . it has met all my upgrade goals . printing is faster , scanning is much faster . the network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on . i have n't played with the fax side yet , but am hoping this finally let 's me retire my trusty standalone fax machine .
0	you do n't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals . keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them . did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel ? there 's no gold inside ! so there 's no need for oxygen-free , gold tipped , multi sheilded , super mega supreme cables . if you do n't believe me , buy this cable and a no-name cheapie . compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference . with analog signals , a good quality cable may make a difference ( although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope ) .
0	it says it 's an a/v dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv . i 'm really pissed about this product.what a waste ! a/v cables that sell for 20 $ are incredible . they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the a/v inputs of my tv
0	amazon fail to deliver item within a reasonable time . the item fail to arrive and therefore we never received the good
1	not quite as bright a conventional flashlight , but certainly bright enough . no battery feature ca n't be beat . manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind . i 've never left mine on that long , but i 've only needed to wind it once in over a year . this is an excellent flashlight . i 've bought several
1	i love the sling media slingbox tuner ! the install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews . the quality of picture is just as good as on my cable tv . i have a great processor with the highest internet speed i could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color i get with it and may also be the reason i have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time . plue my shipment from amazon was in 2 days ! you rock amazon !
0	do not buy this if you own the c340 -- it does n't fit and amazon should n't market this as if it will . it 's a nightmare to have to get it returned and get a refund . this is also true for the cigarette lighter adapter -- i hope there will be clarity as to which accessories go with each model otherwise , you 'll be in for a lot of wasted time and money . the garmin is great , but the fact that most of their accessories are not compatible within the product family is a huge problem .
0	this product is great the only problem i have is that upon downloading the drivers for this item i get a warning from my server stating that this devise does not have an id certificate and it advises me not to use this item for it may damage my computer . i want to use this item but i am afraid to please verify you certificate so i can complete my downloa
0	i bought this hd because my lacie ( which had lasted over 5 years ) crashed on me finally . so i figured i would try a different company . out of the box this product looked great , although it was very large and heavy . i immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up - however that was the one and only time that it booted . i tried several more times and it would n't boot up . very very scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data and it wo n't boot up out of the box . i do n't know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked - but i am not taking any chance on a defective hd and my data . going back to lacie
1	got 3 of them a few months ago , and buying another one now . excellent product , fits many different plug types . no flaws .
1	the product works fine . it seems kind of strange that i had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that i needed . the linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so i ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the linksys units to make sure they did n't pop off
1	this xd memory card works perfectly with my camera fujifilm finepix f650 . good buy for the price
1	if your a serious gamer and want the best quality money can buy , like me , i would highly suggest this product . sounds are crystal clear , and fiber optics is the next step up in technology . my first question for you would be , `` how much do you invest in your gaming ? '' . once again , if your like me the answer is a lot . my next question would be `` how important is your audio experience ? '' you dont know what your missing out on until you actually experience the difference . very happy with this product
1	just a note to those who 've been having trouble opening these cases , without breaking them . if you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together , you 'll be able to open and close it ok. do n't sand too much , and just do the top knob , or it wo n't hold together . i like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive , so i wanted to make them work . hope it works for you
0	7 out of the 25 disks would not write . i didnt much care for the product considering this factor .
1	if you want a budget home theater system for under $ 200 there is probably not many systems better then the sony ht-ddw700 . this system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room . considering the price , sound quality is actually better then expected for me . the tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity . they may look like cheap computer speakers but they are n't and are a bit heavier then they look . the center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low . the surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though . if set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well . some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin . they are fixed and ca n't be replaced . also , if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you . the 8 '' subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system . it is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under $ 200 . it is n't powered , is very light ( only 9 lbs ) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass . the volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls . the receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs . it should be enough in most cases . an extra digtal input or two would n't hurt but again the system is under $ 200 . setup could n't be easier . you just hook up the included microphone , place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote . the system will automatically sets up the speaker distance , delay and volume levels . the receiver comes with the basic pro logic ii music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources . it also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they do n't really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all . basically , if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under $ 200 then there is n't much better then the sony ht-ddw70
1	i travel overseas a lot for my job . this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your `` normal '' plugs for operating four devices . most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money ( wires , cables , etc . ) but this gizmo rocks
0	i own one of these , it came packaged in my dell xps renegade . sound in a windows environment is good , as indicated by other reviews . but in a gaming environment for example world of warcraft , and not just this game , i and other user 's have experienced the squeal of death , wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal , and may hard lock your computer . either way this can only be corrected by rebooting . check out the forums before buying any creative labs products . buyer beware !
0	received my camera today ( 05/22 ) and all items are not in the box . i am missing hand strap , ni-mh batteries , battery charger and cradle adapter . worse part is i did receive a usb cable but it is not the right size and does n't fit . this is very frustrating . how do i get the missing items
0	works fine on windows xp , but does not work well with linux . i 've been using linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time , and still had issues getting this card to run under linux . my built in 10/100 nic was much faster than this card would go . ended up getting an intel gigabit card that , of course , works with no issues . save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a linux box .
0	this product does not hold the smaller ipods well at all , only should be bought by people with the bigger model ipods .
0	soon parted ... . very disapointed , bad design , not for the gym which is what i bought them for.. sound is ok , not wonderful ... wish i would have read these reviews before i spent the $ 100 .
1	this is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot . it is also silent and convenient . it is more flexible with the fat 32 format it comes in but i preferred the ntfs file format whice is safer and more stable . it was no problem to reformat to ntfs
0	what a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service ! i got a shuffle and something happened the second time i tried to load music to make it not even play . i took it to the apple store in mall of america ( minneapolis , mn ) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it . i go back home ( ok ) and it still does not work . apple said for $ 113 they 'll fix . gee thanks ! i 'll be looking at another brand ! apple stinks
0	our company bought two of this model in 2005 for our new branch office . after we set them up , it works just fine . we did n't use any of the advanced features at that time . after reading the user 's guide and online forum at the linksys web site , we found out that there are a battery inside the router that is not user replaceable . you need to send it in for replacement . sure enough , we now have two routers that ca n't retain any configuration settings . they all reset to factary default all of a sudden , one after 1 year , the other after 1 and half year . also note , we updated one of the router to newest firmware , which prevents any kind of connection from the internet . needless to say , my boss is really crossed with me because i was the one recommend the model
0	does not work with non-apple base stations ! i had a powermac g5 . i was told by apple retail store clerks it will work any wireless g access points . but no ! at my house my pc can see no less than 6 wireless ap 's ( some from neighbors , one mine ) . but this airport card can only see one ( which is an apple airport station ) ! tried everything ( googled , set encryption modes , slow downed my linksys wap tranfering bitrate to 2mbps etc ... ) and no luck . returning it tomorrow
0	i recently bought my second of these . the first had a digital tuner . you had to get used to the feel . after about a year of use , one earphone went out . the one i just bought has an analogue tuner , and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high-powered pop ( and around here , country ) stations . the tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial . i ca n't believe sony is charging $ 40.00 for this cheap piece of junk
1	this product work perfectly in the epson printer ! the quality of printing is great !
0	this device is much bulkier than it needs to be . but an even worse offence is that the device can not control the ipod . the ipod plugs in to the back , and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod . it is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit ; then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too
0	my first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my hp deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing . i replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all . while repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested , the etch tore . when examing the inside of the printer , i found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage . the next new cartridge would not work either . $ $ wasted . tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure ( after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out ) . printer repair would cost me more a new one
0	i bought one of these when i bought my macbook to keep it in pristine condition , just a few months ago . i just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my macbook . they should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the macbook of a softer material , or created a design where it wo n't rub against the laptop . really stupid design . it may have protected against some very minor scratches , but likely i 'm worse off for using this cover ( scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity ) . i do n't think in the long run it was worth $ 40 , and i feel very misled by the marketing for this cover . given the choice again i would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money
1	great product that works exactly as described . i have not used this as a stand-alone label maker ; i 've only used it with my computer . the software is fairly easy to use , and it will pull data from an excel spreadsheet , which is a definite plus . i had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which i needed to make labels , and linking to the excel doc made the process very quick and convenient . the only complaint i have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey . i spent $ 40 on the label maker , and so far i 've spent $ 60 on tape
0	there is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger . it works fine . however the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me . 1 -- the connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for zune so you have to take it out of the case . 2 -- the signal is very weak and did not work for me in either of my cars . i ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100 % better sound quality
1	i bought this mouse about three months ago , and i love it . it works on every surface , and the scroller works well too . the only complaint i have is that the cord is rather short ( about 2.5 feet long ) , and it plugs into the left-hand side of my laptop , which means that i only have about a foot to work with . although , i think that complaint can be shared equally with the dell people for putting the usb port on the left ( good deal for the left-handed population , i guess ) . some people have complained about the wind-up function for the cord getting tangled , but i have n't had any problems with that
0	the epson r2400 is a purely photo printer . be sure to understand this before you buy . so if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it . . . think again . the k3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted . it took three calls to epson and replacing the icc profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the k3 ink compatibility with the plain paper . all the magazines raved about the black and white printing quality . not . at least not on premium quality photo paper . perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers . i saw very little improvement over my epson r320 . now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer . the biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as staples . the in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore . this is hint # 1 . hint # 2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for monday you are sol . the only option you have is to order the ink online . trust amazon as they can find and deliver . however if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges . cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $ 12- $ 15 each with eight of them your burning $ 100- $ 125 a set . bulk ink tanks are coming out but i doubt the k3 inks will be imitated . if you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you . however at $ 850 i fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper . i have n't been happy with this printer and i plan to replace it soon . amazon 's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here .
0	despite what the belkin folk told me over the phone , this does not work on a mac
1	this product worked very well , and was easy to hook up . for my use i had 3 video game systems using component video optical audio , and the switching was very quick . i replaced separate manual switchers for toslink component , and am happy with this product
0	i bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system . i based my decision on information as stated on the pioneer web site , and the attractive price compared to some of the other options i considered . this receiver does have a number of good features , but has one serious flaw . it will not display on screen status messages for daily operations , like volume and sound mode , unless you have a pioneer display , and run another special cable from the receiver to the tv ( as a side note , pioneer needs to understand we want to run less cables to our display ) . that means you only get to see the simple set-up screen on your non-pioneer tv , which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver , and very infrequently after that . ( the set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs , and audio calibtraion . ) sounds like a small deal , but in many home theaters , including mine , the electronics are not in the line of site ( mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything . ) this not uncommon , many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors , and it means i have no idea what the volume is , what sound mode i am using , or anything beyond the set-up menu unless i go into the closet . bad , bad , bad ! this seems to be a marketing ploy by pioneer to get you to buy pioneer tv 's and projectors , and it is beyond stupid . if this was not the case i would rate this receiver much higher , but it is a serious flaw . it makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult . this limitation also means , if you have mulitple displays , i have a plasma tv and projector in my theater , you need to run thier special cable to both displays , and both have to be pioneer . again , i have to say bad , bad , bad ! the other features are as stated on the pioneer website , but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display , and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems , unless they have a pioneer display with sr+ . ( oh yeah , your pioneer display has to be also be equipped with sr+ , thier way of linking the two units . if your pioneer display is not equipped with sr+ , you are again out of luck . did i mention this is bad ? ! ) 25 feb 2007 - addition to reveiw : i called onecall and they will take unit back , but at 15 % restocking fee , plus paying for shipping both ways . while onecall really did nothing wrong ( pioneer is lying about the osd ! ) , it is one of thier vendors and not the customer 's fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud . buyer beware from onecall , thier customer service on this one was not good
0	i purchased this cable and the pins were weak and clumsy . i could not even plug it in and one of the pins broke . i threw it away . it is a piece of junk
0	i know that everyone else seems to love this , so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general . my ipod mini ( pink ) is a lemon . the battery has never worked properly . it takes longer to charge than to discharge , and my current playing time per charge ( no changing settings , not backlighting , nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies ) is about 2 hours . apple will gladly sell me a new ( $ 70 ) battery , but other than that tough . it is apparently my fault thet they 're selling shoddy products . i 'm not saying do n't buy it . there are n't realistically any better choices out there than the ipod , but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you . as for me , i think i 'm going to dig out my old discman
0	the buttons do n't have that clicky button feel , so you press and you 're like `` did it go ? '' ... the labels are hard to read , icons take a little figuring out . honestly i use it for turning on/off , and if i want to do anything else i go up to the ihome to adjust it .
1	i have bought this for about 8pp in my office for their black and white desktop printer . so far not one problem . the toner is long-lasting and affordable . great quality- small desktop footprint . does a great job with envelopes , labels and even light cardstock . i would highly reccommend to anyone
1	i just purchased this item two days ago ( thurs . ) today ( sat . ) i removed my 160gb seagate hhd from my kingwin enclosure and installed it in this one . installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan . fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet . i used the firewire connection instead of usb and the drive access is much faster than it was with the usb connection on the other enclosure . the price is a little steep compared to others but i got a generous rebate offer with my purchase . although the case is plastic ( my other one was aluminum and plastic ) i wo n't be moving mine around so that wo n't be an issue
1	i , like many other people that have written reviews here , researched the purchase of an mp3 player in great detail . other members of my family own ipods , and that is the direction that i was heading until i did a massive amount of research . if you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on cd , this is the unit that you want . ipod will not let you download your own songs , i did not know that until after i purchased this player ( thankfully ) . this unit was the highest rated unit by far that i was able to scour the internet for . if this is your first purchase of an mp3 player ( like mine ) buy this one , no questions asked . do not worry about trying to buy $ 80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal . crisp , clear , awsome base and i have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40 . i can not hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing . i received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when i got home from work and by 6:35 i have transfered the 114 artists folders ( about 4,000+ songs ) that i had ripped on my computer last week ( about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player ) . i would recomend buying the cradle , it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo , which i plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool . absolutley buy this unit . i have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and i have a high performance expectation and it has met it
1	within about 12 seconds of opening the box i was listening to my ipod on my home stereo . wires are well made . there may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever
1	this is about the only mouse i buy , have gone through a couple of them in the past few years . i just ca n't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out . this model is one that i find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using . if you want a good , reliable , comfortable mouse , this logitech is a good choice
0	i was expecting at least a degree worth of difference , it did not help at all ! absolute waste of 50 dollars
1	speakers give good sound quality and are small and unnoticeable at a good price all the things i was looking for in speake
0	easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working . horrible customer service ! will never buy from this company again !
1	i ordered this for my teenage daughter for christmas and she loves it . the sound is great and the amplifier works well . for the price it plays like a much more expensive instrument . i recommend this to any new player wanting to learn the guitar
1	i gave this 5 stars only because it serves its purpose well . it 's just a basic mouse pad , but the price is excellent ! !
0	i have had a canon g2 since 2002 . i used to use viking 128 mb cf cards and had no problem . in october 2004 , i bought one viking cf512m 512mb cf card from amazon . i did not use it until this summer . after i had taken 20 more photos and reviewed , i immediately found a few images corrupted . no matter how i tried , e.g . format the cf before use , there were alway corrupted images . i wonder if i can return the defect cf card and get a replacement from amazon or from manufacturer ? sherwood l.a. count
0	this home theater package , despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality , is ultimately very disappointing . i 'm new to hdtv and hdmi so i did n't know as much as i needed in order to make a fully informed decision . i have a sony bravia xbr3 , oppo upconverting dvd player , scientific atlanta hd box and nintendo wii game console . this unit only offers pass-through video , so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the tv for each type of input ( hdmi , component , etc. ) . for the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection , you 'll pay in extra cabling costs . the hdmi on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your dvd or cable to the receiver , and then from the receiver to your tv . again , major inconvenience and lots of additional connections . the manual for this unit is beyond terrible . i 'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one . for example , there was a hum when watching tv that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some are n't . nothing in the manual about this . there are probably just enough hdmi and component connections for the basic user like myself . plus side is that there is no dvd player with this , so i can use my own . given a chance to do this again , i would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output
1	good price . just not sure it is needed
1	i read some of the reviews about installation issues and they concerned me initially . but , when it came time to get the printer up and running on my wireless network , there really were n't any issues . just following the directions ( and avoiding the easysecure option ) worked fine . i would highly recommend this printer-the quality of the printing is excellent , the feature/function set is quite high for a moderate price , and it 's a great home/office printer that has lots to offer .
1	you really ca n't go wrong with this one . not great response but what do you expect for less than $ 300 ? on the other hand , the possibilities for this surround system are endless . want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen ? how about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system , ( this is how my daughter has it configured ) . it 's our second one . first one died as a result of recent electrical storm , ( yes the circuit was 'protected ' , but so what ) . could n't be happier for the investment
1	i looked at all the different cases for my new ipod with video , and the reviews kept pointing me back to this case . so i bought it . it exceeds my expectations . it 's fantastic . my ipod is now completely contained and scratchproof . this helps when down the road i might want to sell it . the screen cover is perfectly clear and seems very durable . i like the fact that it 's held off of the ipod 's screen so it wo n't scratch . the clickwheel is easily usable , actually more so because of the circle around it . i bought the case on amazon from sonicswap and am astounded at how fast i got it . 2 days ! amazing . this case is for the 60gb ipod with video . it clearly says that in the title ; not sure how that one reviewer got confused about that . do n't hesitate . this is the case
0	very poor design..would never recommend this product . the connection is so flaky , you will end up wasting lot of time
1	i bought a zen 30g mp3 player and could not stand the earbuds they came with . they hurt so much that i used head phones until these v-moda earbuds came in . they are awesome . the fit is so comfortable and the sound it wonderful . i got them on sale for less than they are running right now on amazon , so i feel pretty good about the purchase . =
0	syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser . i got my daughter one as a gift , gave it to her bran new , in the factory sealed box and syntax refuses to honor the warranty , ( and yes i calld everywere and tried everything ) .
1	this is my first experience with hdtv and wide screen . this 46 '' sony tv is excellent with hd programs ; with regular broadcasts , it is a bit muddy , but that is the fault of the signal , not the tv . i am very pleased with the overall quality of the set . i had the set professionally installed and set up , and i am sure glad i did : install and set up are not for amateurs like me ; if anything ever happens , i will be hard pressed to reset things . sony 's instruction manuals are not that great
0	i purchased the md781 + md71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the md681 . i really like the md681 but i could never locate one of its expansion handsets ( everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock ) . overall i 'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use i am already looking for another phone . handheld phones : i like them more than any other phone i 've tried . unlike most phones these days they 're big and have a very solid feel to them ... it 's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation . the buttons are a nice size and easy to use . the hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well . with one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good , but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it 's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation . the shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better . it 's a few clicks and slow to access ... almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand ... or copy the number to the local units phonebook ... which defeats the purpose . as for the answer machine : once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of how many messages , if any , are in the system ( is it just me or is that poor design ) , so if you listen to messages when you partner is n't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages . the quality of voice messages is a bit grainy . i also like how the handset docked in the older m681 ; it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base ... the md781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk .
1	i installed this antenna in my pawn shop where we keep most of our electronics running all day . i could never get good reception with standard antennas and now this single antenna does the job better than any i have ever seen . keep in mind that i have a full surveillance systen , alarm syster , phone system , 20 home stereos , a dozen or more computers and on and on . the terk fm-50 has exceeded my expectations . thanks , joel dba pawn-plus
0	pros : cheap cons : bad video quality . moving diagonal lines are clearly visible
0	i loved this phone , but after only a few weeks the button is stuck and the phone ca n't pick up . i want it fixed but do n't know how
0	i bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my ipod . i used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound . sending these ones back . i must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well ( much to my mom 's dismay , she could n't fuss at me : -p ) . oh well .
0	terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features . pulls multiple papers through , so you must start again . is a g3 , which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-g3 fax machines - wrong - so you ca n't fax to 75 % of the community that has a non g3 unit ! i thought i was buying quality from canon when i paid $ 250 for this hunk of junk ! the cheap brother and hp 's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use , and much less expensive . save your money and save the headaches ! sorry canon , this product was a disaster
1	i am very pleased with the brother p-tough ql-500 . the printing lables are a good price for the quantity you get .
0	i 've had my micro for over a year now , and when it worked , i loved it ! however , i 'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue ; the sound is output in layers , and i am constantly trying to `` reposition '' my headphones to get full sound . my husband called creative labs for assistance , and he was told that it would cost him [ ... ] per month for a `` customer service subscription . '' after reading these reviews , it seems we 'd be paying creative labs [ ... ] so that they could tell us there 's nothing they can ( or will ) do . next brand , please ...
1	the only thing i do n't like about it , is the scanning area is upside down where most scanners you open the lid and put your photo or document close to you this scanner you have to put it all the way to the back of the scanner so you have to open the lid all the way . also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use . i did like the way xp found this scanner right away with no disks or software . i have a cannon scanner i just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with xp with out cannons software , the cannon was so bad that i purchased this one all in all i like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers
1	this card , using via 's superb envy24 ht chipset , is a huge improvement over my realtek and via envy24ht-s based cards . everything sounds better . my old audigy 2 platinum ( which i think i shall melt ) did better in 3d games , but only slightly . since this card does n't snap , crackle , and pop like the creative cards do , i 'll venture to say that it actually does make games better , since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game . pros : * very high audio sampling rates , allowing for incredibly good audio production ; warm , rich , warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs . * no crackling , popping , or hissing ! a real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why creative labs cards keep doing this . * well-maintained , solid drivers . * supports eax 2.0 * excellent asio support . cons : * no hardware support for directsound ; however , if your machine is faster than about 1ghz , you probably wo n't notice the difference . benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you 'll find that no hardware directsound acceleration amounts to *less* than a 1 % difference in speed . * only supports up to eax 2.0 , due to creative labs refusing to license the technology . sound difference is minimal , though
0	i 'm usually a big linksys supporter . this is an exception . this device is a joke . not a very funny one . the first thing i was told when i called for support was it most likely would n't work with my printer ( canon mp950 ) . i spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support . do n't waste your time
1	radio reception in my apartment is terrible . i have purchased a few indoor antennas , even a different terk model , but none of them helped very much . i had to move the antenna around to different areas for different stations , and my digital fm radio only received one digital channel . this unit , however , works great . i get every station i want , and the digital fm works great . the only thing i would mention is that the antenna casing is bulky , so if you 're concerned about asthetics you 'll have to figure out where you can conceal it . also , i did n't get any additional benefit from the amplifier , but the antenna worked so well that i did n't need it
