Very interesting spoof of the original game. I found the first one boring after a few plays, but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays. It's a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth it 
After I saw the advertisement for Clue DVD I immediately went out to buy it. I've always been a fan of Clue and this updated version provides players with some new twists and excellent graphics. While you are playing the game, the Butler and an Inspector often appear to provide you with Clues about the case. Another addition to the game is added locations and having to figure the time of the crime. Any Clue fan will appreciate this version 
I always thought Clue looked like a complicated game I'd never touch! That is until I played it at my friends house! Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions! This game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time! I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older 
This is an extremely fun and addictive game. You shuffle the cards, and place three (room, weapon, person) in the secret envelope. In every room you go into, you can make accusations. If someone has the card you accused (like the room), then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad. The game changes constantly, so it never gets boring. The character pieces have teeny details, like Mr. Green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. I gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really THINK. Oh, and good problem-solving skills too. And coordination (you have to add all the clues up to see who did it). All in all, a terrific game. Great for rainy days or playdates. And did I mention the weapons? Very realistic. And cute 
This was a little difficult to figure out in the beginning - Actually had to read the instructions - but it was very fun and very disney. Fam loves it 
My son received this game for Christmas and it is by far his favorite game. He enjoys pretending to be a detective and the game is easy enough for him to play and understand. I just have to figure out how to get more of the scoring sheets 
I bought this game long time ago but unfortunately all my friends were busy until X'mas. There were 5 of us and once we started playing, we were all addicted! I have heard from some other friends commented Clue was a boring game, but we all found it fun and challenging! Apart from strict logic thinking, the keys to win were to ask the right question and make a good, well organised notes! Last time we played we had 5 players, so some of us got 4 cards in hand and some got only 3 in hands. That was a bit unfair because the players with 4 cards had more clues in the beginning and so their chances of winning were higher. So we tried in one game to open 3 cards on the table, the game was finished a lot more quickly. But we all found that it was less challenging. Overall, great game!! Train you brain in logic thinking as much as Sudoku and Mastermind 
I purchased the creamy crayons for the grandkids, they really enjoyed drawing and coloring with them. Their mothers had tons of fun with them also. Something different from the markers and same old crayons. Maybe I'll get some for myself yet! 
Our daughter is the youngest and has 2 older brothers. Finally she is playing with a "girl toy". She loves to put all the stuff in, makes calls, and use her "credit card". She is only 2, but enjoys the purse very much and the boys aren't allowed to touch it 
This is my second purchase, the first was a christmas gift for my 2 yr old niece who lives in the UK. She absolutely adores it, and of the virtual "Toys R Us" environment she lives in, this is one of her favorite toys. It's so popular that this second purchase is a birthday gift for one of her playmates 
This is a great purse for my 15 month old girl who loves playing with my wallet and lipstick while riding in the shopping cart. All the pieces are the right size for her little hands and she loves walking around with the cellphone and keys and "putting on" the lipstick. Some of the pieces were lost easily as most of her things get misplaced but overall I'm very happy with this! Oh, and my daughter loves it,too 
I gave this purse to my niece for her second birthday, and she never put it down. The keys and the cell phone were her favorite. She put it on her arm, and was ready to go! I would recommend this to anyone who has a gift to give a little girl. They feel just like Mommy 
My daughter got this purse for her second birthday, she loves the lipstick and the keys. great toy great pric 
This purse is very sturdy and works well for a girl age 2-3, if you don't mind the overtly girly aspect of it (e.g., lipstick and compact). My daughter drags it around outside and in, and it holds up well 
Our 19 month old enjoys playing with this purse. She enjoys the purse itself, the cell phone, and the lipstick the most. The mirror, keys, wallet, and credit card aren't played with much. The only complaint I have is that she is unable to open the wallet on her own. Trying to open the wallet frustrates her to no end--it's hard for a young toddler to have the dexterity to open such a thing 
This is a must have for your little sweetheart! My daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes. It's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next ;)The accessories are cute, but she'd rather use stuff from Mommy's purse. ;) The purse is oh so cute too, and durable. My daughter is 21 months old, she received this on Christmas and has been a favorite since. 
Our almost 2-year old daughter got this for Christmas, and she still plays with it several months later. Highly recommend. The only thing missing is some dress-up shoes to go along with it :- 
We have had this toy with both our daughters. My 3yr old still enjoys playing with it, but because it is so low to the ground my baby (almost a year) is the one that really loves it. My first daughter loved it just as much when she was about that age also. We like the shapes and the basic pots and open and closing of the doors and such. It is difficult to put things in the fridge and have them stay, but that isn't such a big deal because they play in all the other compartments. By the time my oldest was two she was ready for a bigger kitchen, but it is great entertainment for the younger! 
My daughter LOVED this kitchen from about 9 mos. till about 13 mos., then she lost interest. She used to dance to the sounds that it makes (which to me are fun and not irritating, like other toys). It did sometimes go off on its own...usually if a door slammed or even thunder. We would just turn it off at night. This toy was by far my baby's favorite and it held her interest much longer than any other toy. Its a great size for a busy crawler/new walker and it has enough things to open/press/drop for the 7-12 mos. set. Though the 2 and 3 year-olds who come over have fun with it too! I recommend this for babies younger than one year, though he/she may have fun with it longer than that 
My daughter loves to open and close the microwave, refridgerator door, and oven door. She also likes the sounds this makes. My older daughter had a different model about 5 years ago which she just adored. Both seem really good, although the prior one was a bit better...the door was sturdier and it came with shapes that were "ice cubes" - they would put them in the shape sorter door, then push a button and they would come out. This one, you just place the food shapes in the slots and they fall out. Also, there was a slot for the phone...this model it just comes with the phone, with no real "place" for it. ANYWAYS, all in all, this one is good and she enjoys it (just turned 1). Definitely good buy for 9mos+ 
I don't know why some reviewers are complaining about the size of this-just read the description. We bought this for my 8 month old and she loves it. It is the first toy she goes to every morning. It is the perfect size for her and she loves opening and closing all the doors. I think it makes an ideal first kitchen 
My little girl loves this toy! It's perfect for a 1-year old. It makes sounds, has a shape sorter, and has doors to open and close. I also recommend the set of accessories that go with it 
My 17 month old enjoys playing with this kitchen, mimicking Mommy. However, in the past few months she has REALLY shown an interest in kitchen playsets for 2+ that are for the child to stand at while using. She doesn't go to this kitchen as often as she used to. For her, this toy seemed to be at it's prime for about 3 months (12-15 months of age) and now she has moved on to the next level of play. It is a cute toy that introduces toddlers to kitchen "ideas", but it either needs more intrigue or a younger age to start. I think that when she was 9 months old or even just sitting up she would have had fun playing with parts of it-opening the refrigerator/microwave/or oven, hitting the stove to make the music play or turning the "water" in the sink to make the music play. She may have had more trouble with the shape sorter then, but I think toys are good to grow into. I do not recommend this as a 12-month toy. Wait a few months and buy one for 2+ 
I agree with the other reviewer that this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen. My daughter loved it when she was 1. Now she's turned 2 and she's lost interest in it, like many other "baby toys". I had to get her a larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can "cook" with it 
The Sudoku board game allows players to compete in a multiplayer Sudoku game. Each player/team gets assigned a game board (mild, hot, or spicy) and races to see who can complete the puzzle first. The game includes two boards, two number sets, and one set of game cards. This game is very enjoyable and entertaining. Another neat feature is one player can use this game alone. Since the boards do not require a game card to work, the number of games is un-limited and can come from many different sources (books, magazines, website, etc), which requires you to place the given numbers yourself. This has provided us a great way to play Sudoku without the pencil and will continue to provide another way to enjoy Sudoku 
No more quick-swingers sitting on pitches, and frustrating even the most creative movement pitchers. Now, with a quick twist of the red centerpiece, Wiffle Ball has added a new pitch - a real fastball (without the wiffled movement) - to keep those batters in check. This ball does amazing things with that little changeable ring. I just wish the quality were a little better so the red ring wouldn't fly off as easily after a well-hit pitch, which also sometimes causes the ball to start cracking around the center. But with that said, a Junk Ball easily lasts at least one 7-inning, two-out game. And, oh, the trickery 
If you are interested in this kitchen because you would like to expose your children to new languages, I would keep looking. My goal was to expose my daughter to French, but the quality of the voice is so poor that I can barely understand what is being said in English! The quality of the construction is fine but, frankly, you're paying for the added bonus of the languages and it simply isn't worth it. I would recommend looking for a regular kitchen, whose design you like, and finding another way to introduce language 
This kitchen is reasonably priced with lots of kitchen accessories. My 2 1/2 year old daughter has fun playing with it when she's in the mood to play kitchen. It has most of the "kitchen" things you'd think of: sink, dishes, pots, pans, oven, mixer, etc. The food has RFID chips built in so when you put them in the pan/pot on the stove, it speaks and says things like, "mmm, eggs... and... bacon, you're a great cook! (frying sound)". This mostly amazes adults. The biggest gripes are the oven is unnecessarily small (like they were trying the RFID in the oven as well and it didn't work) and the refrigerator door has HORRIBLE fit and won't close. Overall, for the price this kitchen satisfied and has lots of accessories. If you can live with the bad fit and finish, this is one of the more bargain kitchen toys available 
My daughter got his for her second birthday and loves it. The toy is very durable and so much fun. The voices are also entertaining and educational. Our oven door also works very well. My daughter is kind of rough and this toy lasts throughout the torment, so that's very good. I didn't like that the voice can be kind of hard to hear and the oven is so small, but my daughter enjoys it regardless and that's all that matters 
we bought this kitchen set for our daughter for christmas. thinking since it was little tike it would be the best buy and would stand up for a young child. i have bought little tike before. but I'm not sure I will again. the refrigerator door doesn't even come close to fitting. the oven door is warped one side doesn't close. it repeats the same phrases over and over. the tape from shipping left ink on the doors. we were very disappointed with the whole kitchen set 
I bought this cook set for my 2 yr old little boy for Christmas, he was so excited. He couldn't wait for it to be put together so we sat down and went to work and didn't get very far. There was no stickers or screws at all. Talk about a very disappointed little boy on Christmas morning. As you can imagine I was too. So we never got to see how any of it worked. I would not recommened anyone to buy this toy. 
I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas, and she loves it. The product I feel is designed well, and is small enough to fit in her room. A previous review stated they had difficulty building it, but if you follow the directions (step one shows to leave the screws loose), it goes together easily. My husband and I were able to put this together in less than 1/2 hour including trying to stop our daughter from playing with it while it was under construction. Another reviewer had voiced disappointment over the door to the fridge not closing completely. Ours doesn't close all the way, but it stays closed. No Little Tikes toy I have ever purchases has latches to close the doors. The sound level is great in the high position, and she enjoys the comments it makes. I haven't had any trouble with understanding what the voice is saying as others have commented. We're planning on buying some of the additional food sets for more play. Overall I think this was a great buy, and I feel it will be keeping my daughter (and I!) busy for many many hours ahead 
I purchased this for my 2 boys, 5 and 3, in February. Got it on clearance at Walmart for $19, but would not have wanted to spend much more on it. I debated whether to get this or another kitchen that made cooking sounds but didn't speak in 3 languages, and since we're trying to raise our children bilingual (at least!) we thought having a talking kitchen would be preferable. Unfortunately, the voices are hard to understand - not that they're soft, but there seems to be a lot of mumbling and static, so if you don't know exactly what the voice is saying already, you wouldn't be able to learn that, for example, the spanish word for bacon is "tocino" - it sounds more like "poseena". Beyond that, however, both boys have enjoyed it. It's a little small for the 5-yr old now but they both still play with it. They occasionally get frustrated that only the cookie sheet will fit into the oven (you can't put in a pot or nearly any other cooking vessel from our other playsets). The reason for this is obvious- the sensor for the talking feature is at the top of the oven, thus in order to be close enough to the food for the sensor to respond to whatever is there, the floor of the oven had to be raised rather high. If I had to do it again, I would probably look for a kitchen set that only had cooking sounds and not the talking feature, as it's just not used that often in this house. 
I'm very happy with this purchase for my developing artist who is 2 1/2 yrs old. Living in the caribbean, the sleeves are a bit long but it's exactly what you need for experimenting artists...so I just crank up the air conditioner to not let my artist sweat too much 
I couldn't think up a better way to protect kids clothes than with this apron! The long sleeves are a great feature. It also seems to fit a wide range of toddlers and young children. I love the little pockets for supplies and whatnot. Also, it wipes clean quite easily! This apron is a winner in my book 
Inexpensive and much better protection than dad's old shirt. Heavy clear/printed vinyl. Concerns about fit listed in ratings did not hold true. Purchased for use in pre-k class and apron has lots of growing room could be likely be used for several more years. Nice velcro closures make apron easy for child and teacher. 
So many art smocks are too little for elementary students, but these were big enough to both fit and cover school uniforms! Hooray for no more paint on white shirts 
Harder to get into than I first thought. The kids are anxious to get to "work" and fidget getting into this, the arms are a bit too tight. It seems bulky as well. Better off going old school - daddy's old shirt on backwards 
My son loves the episode II clone troopers (especially the ones from the animated 'Clone Wars' I II series. When he saw this, there was no question that he had to have it! Along with the "Hunt for Grievous" clone trooper 5-pack, this is his favorite amongst all of the Star Wars action figures and vehicles. The only draw back is the rear turret which bends when you set it on a flat surface and the repelling hooks on the back, which have long strings that seem an afterthought in the design 
This is by far the best paint job on a republic gunship! The republic gunship has been the rarest vehicle in the prequel trilogy since 2002. It has been repainted 4 times now, and this is the most unique. It is painted to look like the gunship used in volume 2 of the clone wars, when the ARC's are going to save the jedi from general grievous. It goes along great with the hunt for grievous battle pack. You can recreate one of the best parts of the clone wars with this vehicle 
The luckiest outcome of the prequel trilogy was the Clone Wars cartoon. All of the toys from this series are fantastic. My daughter literally gasped when I showed her the display I'd made. The Tiger Shark Gunship is another good addition to the line 
This is a fun family game. It is educational and a good way for kids to learn the value of a dollar. It does, however, have a million pieces that you could easily lose - which is a nightmare for mom and dad! However, this remains one of my kids favorite games even for my 12 year old 
I bought this game for my new family for Christmas. This is not at all the Game of Life that I remember playing for countless hours as a child. First of all, my old game had all of the mountains, houses, and spinner permenantly attached to the game board. With the new version, all of these things have to be attached with each setup, which takes about 10-15 minutes and they are easily knocked off the board. Also, the spinner is hard to spin and frequently comes off of its pivot. The cars are less sturdy and the people pegs do not stay in the car so you are constantly having to put the people back in the car. Finally, the rules of the game have gotten more complicated and yet the meaning of the game has become more trivial. I think I will put this in the top of a closet or in a yard sale and go find my old version of the game to play in the future 
Growing up, my family always loved playing games, so now that I am starting a family of my own, I've been collecting old favorites for my own "game library." The Game of Life was one of the first games I purchased, but I could not have been more disappointed in the quality of the "new and improved" game. The game I grew up with had the buildings, bridges, houses, etc. permanently embedded into the game board. With the new game, these 3D decorations come off and and have to be placed on the board each time you play. This is my main complaint with the new game. Every time you accidently knock the board or brush one of the buildings with your sleeve, they fall off. Add to this the age-old problems of people not staying in the cars and the spinner not working properly (it's worse in the new game, by the way) and The Game of Life becomes a game of frustration. After one game with the new game board, our family decided we would not play the game again. I am now looking on auction sites trying to find one of the "old fashioned" game boards. They really took a step backwards with this one 
I bought this for my 8 11 year old girls as an extre inexpensive Christmas gift, and I was pleasently surprised how much they enjoy it 
I got this message from the recipient's mother: He loves it, really! well-made drawer - shelf design. It's heartwarming when he settles down industriously using his art supplies 
over all a good gift for children but I feel that maybe you could have added few peices of paper. Thank 
Our son received this as a gift, and we sent it back. The box is made of inferior wood, and very poorly constructed. Not really "constructed" at all - rather just glued together, and not well, at that. Two of the corners were coming apart. Also, the lid opens in two parts. The drawback: when you open or close either side, the plastic trays on the inside that hold the crayons and pastels, fall out, as there is nothing securing them to the box. So, you have to try to hold the tray in place while closing either side. We can't comment on the supplies themselves, as we did not allow our son to try them, or else he would not have been able to return the item. 
I loved Electronic Talking Battleship as a kid in the 1980's and have been anxious recently to play this game again. I was always excited looking through the back of the play booklet when picking out a board. I was also always nervous when the opposing player would hit the red button, firing their missile. You hope they'll miss but you'll get a bit nervous once they manage to hit one of your ships. You also hope they won't sink all your ships before you can figure out where their ships are. On the other hand, when you're the one pressing the red button, you're eager to hear that crashing sound - hitting one of your opponent's ships. A good feature of this game is that you can play someone or you can play against the computer. When someone plays against the computer, one usually loses. But I recall as a kid beating the computer a few times so that's not the case here. In all, Electronic Talking Battleship is worth the money and will bring many hours of entertainment. A great investment! - Donna Di Giacom 
I bought this for my 8 year old. Although it took an adult to read, understand and then teach the rules of play, once we got the basic (classic) game figured out, it was easy. There is an advance game too, but it is too complicated for us. We enjoyed it a lot, and it makes you plan and do some thinking, as to where to put your ships. My son always wants MORE MORE MORE when it comes to Battleship. The game talks, and it closes up with a carrying handle. That makes it more money than the other versions, but it is well-made and worth the price 
This was a Christmas purchase in our house this year and we have found the game to be incredibly fun from the familiar classic level to the very strategious advanced level. The one drawback that we have found is the annoying fact that the pegs do not fit well in the vertical grid board and are always falling out, or in the case of the planes are sometimes impossible to get out without the pliers that we keep handy when we play. There are four holes on the grid that are part of the support pegs and these holes will not hold a peg for anything. This really detracts from an otherwise superb game 
Among the classic board games that has become a part of American culture. A child is not a child unless he or she has played battleship. A training in search patterns and comprehension of results that are returned to you. Can you create a more effective and efficient search pattern then your peer. Can you create a ship target pattern that is harder to detect based on the strategy your peer uses. A great game 
Most would say that battleships is a game of luck, yet someone known to me proved that there are some very sneaky tactics (without cheating) that you can employ to see that you win. Kind of ruins the fun, but a classic game nonetheles 
My 9 year old son just started to understand this game, we bought it when he was 7. He would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships. He would say where his ships were. This game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are. It depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game. 
If you enjoyed the traditional Battleship game, you'll really love this game. My only complaint is that the voice announcements can be a bit garbled at times. There is a repeat option to hear them again, and we have used that one! Overall, a lot of fun 
Even my 4-year-old can play this game with ease (albeit with someone older reading the cards until he got familiar with the rules). The skills required to play the game are skills that transfer easily to everyday life...decision-making, strategizing, taking setbacks in stride...plus it's tons of fun! I highly recommend this game to both kids and adults 
Sorry is a now-classic game that is derivative of Pachisi, one of the oldest known board games. Players are simply trying to get all of their pieces from their starting place to the end. It's not that simple, though, other players can kick you back to your start (Sorry!) in their own maneuvering to get to their end. This game has clearly withstood the test of time and will be a favorite in your house for many years to come 
Sorry has been an excellent game in working with my first and second grade boys as well as my sixth grade girls. The boys can practice counting and reading while everyone has lessons in sportsmanship. Excellent choice 
Parker Brothers' classic game, Sorry!, is one of those board games that should be in every household. An updated form of the Indian game Parcheesi, Sorry! is a competitive game of revenge where players race to be the first to get all four of their pawns into their "Home" square on the board. Game play is simple: On a player's turn, he or she draws a card from the middle of the board. The cards are numbered 1-12, and there are also several special "Sorry!" cards. Most of the numbered cards indicate how many spaces forward the player can move one of his pawns, although some cards have special instructions. If a player draws a card numbered 1 or 2, they can move a pawn from Start onto the game board. (A 2 card also allows the players to draw again.) A 4 card indicates that the player must move a pawn backwards four spaces. If a player draws a 7, he has the option of splitting the move between two pawns. An 11 gives the player a chance to switch places with an opponent's pawn. And a Sorry! Card lets the player take a pawn from Start and place it on the same square as an opponent's pawn, bumping the opponent back to Start. Game play can get very fierce and intense as players race around the board, trying to be the first to get all four pawns Home. If one player's pawn bumps into another player's pawn on the game board, the bumped pawn has to go back to Start-which can make the players really competitive and vengeful. Sorry! is just one of those games that everyone should have in their closet. It's easy enough for kids to play, but it's fun for grown-ups, too. 
I've played this game since I was a teeny kid and it's still a ton of fun. As with most games, there are small pieces involved that very well may end up someplace where they're not supposed to, plus you can't really afford to lose any of the pieces. Plastic bag 'em 
It's the game of *sweet revenge*. Who wouldn't like this came, a game that as been played for decades and decades. I remember sitting in our sunny sunroom with my brother playing when we were both children, I am now a mother and a Family Daycare provider and my son (6 yrs) and the children I care for enjoy playing. After school my son and the older children run and get a game to play instead of turning on the tv and 7 times out of 10 they pick Sorry. This game can be played by children as young as 3 or 4 yrs and children that are as young as 101.This is a game everyone should own!!! I think I am going to go now, get my son and have a game of Sorry 
Some people hate monopoly, others love it. Me, I like it. I've been playing it for nearly 20 years, ever since I can remember. You really should pick up this fantastic board game and play it with your family and children. If you don't, you will be missing out on one amazingly popular game 
The concept is more or less the same as the standard monopoly. The product is good and is worth the price. Its nice to have the family members sit toghther and Njoy 
I remember reading LotR and I loved the series and the Peter Jackson version. Once I heard of the Monopoly edition of LotR, I was excited. I soon won the LotR Monopoly edition. I came home, invited some relatives and soon had a great time! As you know, Monopoly is a game inwhich you have to be the ultimate monopoly. You buy and sell property, and if you own Mt. Doom and Bara-dur (Boardwalk and Park Place in the original Monopoly) then you get a monopoly. You can build strongholds (houses) and fortresses (hotels) and everytime a rival lands on your property, then he has to give you power (money). If you can't pay the rent then you'll become bankrupt and you are out. You also have to avoid jail. There is some new tokens that resemble characters from LotR. If you had a look at the screenshots of this Monopoly game then you'll notice a lot of changes. But there is a new optional rule you can play with in this version; everytime you roll an "Eye of Sauron" (also counts as one) the golden ring will move to one territory per eye, where you can add strongholds. If you land on a territory with the ring, you may get it for FREE! If you land on an owned territory with the ring on it, you have to pay double the rent. So, if you are a 100% die-hard LotR that only enjoy the books, then you can miss. But if you are looking for a Monopoly board or for LotR stuff, I recommend this game then Note: If Tolkien lived to see this, he would have died immediatly. Infact, I think he's rolling in his grave as I am typing this review. 
Monopoly is a game where you buy properties that have been mortgaged by the owners, and you must buy them for a ****load of money. It is absolutely the best board game series ever made. There are tons of special editions for monopoly, for example: Spongebob Simpsons Family Guy This product is a must buy. BUY IT NOW 
What makes this monopoly version special is the Large Tokens and the difeerent styles of houses and hotels. I love how they made the tokens bigger and heavier. The are also about four different styles of houses and hotels for a little variety in housing. The money holder has felt on it to make it a little more fancy then standard plastic and of course the case is metal instead of the standard cardboard box. Other than that it is the same game. The only complaint I had is that I thought looking at the tin on the shelf that it was a silver and gld colored tin, but it is only siver. The gold is only on the plastic around the tin. 
The Deluxe Edition is quite nice in that it has holders for the different cards and money 
I check every year for an updated version of this, hoping they will add an earphone jack. In my opinion, they just don't care. I bought this for my daughter to use. But the lack of earphone jack, a standard feature, in all but the most prehistoric electronic equipment, is a huge disappointment 
My five year-old daugther wanted this Barbie computer Christmas after receiving the younger Barbie computer for her 3rd birthday. She did not get it because it seemed expsensive but bought it herself with her Christmas money. She loved it from the start. She likes the games and the Spanish on it, too. She loved the mouse at first but then realized that it doesn't travel as well as the ones without a mouse (needs a solid surface versus using it in the car, airplane, drs office). The screen could be larger of course. She finds some games a challenge to figure out the rules and how-tos but overall loves her computer. She is very pleased with her purchase and I think she will be playing it for a couple years. The games are good for the ages 5-8 range 
My 6-year old daughter AND her friend got one of these for Christmas. THEY LOVE IT!!! It has tons of learning games and 5 levels on each game. I can't tell you how much this has helped her reading and writing skills. Once you complete a level, you get a "prize picture". I've been looking all over for the expansion cards because she noticed that they have a slot for them. I have had no luck. I would HIGHLY recommend this product 
I got this for my daughter who is 5 1/2 and she loves it. I think it maybe a little advanced for her but she has been doing the simple math and just loves the idea of using a computer that is only hers. I think she will grow into it. I have two other daughters too who are younger and have handled the laptop and it seems to be holding up just great 
Unless this product has undergone some major renovations, I would think twice about buying it. Here's what I think of last year's model... We got two Barbie B-Books for our daughters for Christmas last year and they have been quite disappointing. After thirty minutes of failed attempts on Christmas morning, our girls put them away and have hardly played with them since. The toy is rated in the 5-8 age range, but both my daughters (ages 5 and 7) have had trouble with them. I didn't expect the world for $50, but it certainly should have been better than this! The display screen is tiny and the dark gray text on light gray background is very hard to see, you have to get the angle exactly right. The graphics are choppy and look like they came from a program designed in the early 80's - all blocky and angular. The sound system is low grade and fuzzy, making it extremely difficult to understand Barbie's instructions. It's impossible to tell the difference when she says "X" and "S" or "V" and "T". Since the screens are so small, the text scrolls across rather than being displayed all at once. Even my seven-year-old (who is a great reader) had trouble keeping up with the scrolling text, and as for my Kindergartner, forget about it! The games are poorly explained and are too difficult for this age range. Even the basic spelling games are ridiculous because the level of difficulty jumps all over the place. In level one, I was asked to spell car, map, tar, and then suddenly cruise and caravan! Nonsense programming like this has caused my daughters much frustration and worse, has made them doubt their own intelligence. We don't even turn the B-Books on anymore. My girls have been able to get a little use out of them when they play office, pretending they're laptop computers. In all, these were an expensive disappointment and not worth the money 
My oldest daughter got the older version of this product for her 5th birthday. She could only play a couple of the games at the time, but she loved it. For three years now it has been her all-time favorite car toy. It has been dropped, banged, kicked, stepped on, fought over, and everything else two kids could do to it in 3 years, and still works great! Drawbacks: Pixter Leapster caught on that kids might actually want to play their toys past 5pm in the car put LCD lighting in, but this company hasn't caught on yet. Also, no headphones jack--some of the games make incredibly annoying noises! One more thing--the ages are not appropriately labeled. Closer to first grade and up 
I know alot about the impressionist already. So getting this game was just to add to my collection. I actually was impressed I learned something new. The writing and explanations are pretty simple, because it's geared towards children, but I still enjoyed it. 
I bought this set for my son who loves to draw and paint. He absolutely loved this set. The colors are wonderful and the different types of pens, paints and crayons make drawing alot more fun for him. The case is sturdy and great so he doesn't lose anything. The price can't be better for everything you get. 
I bought this set for my niece and nephew and they absolutely love it. The colors are great and the case makes it a cinch to store away. This set provides them with hours of fun. I recommend this to everyone 
I bought this for my 5 year old son who loves to draw. The crayons are cheap, compared to Crayola. We tested the 10 different reds searching for the correct "spiderman" red, but they all looked too pink, and pretty much the same color. Also really waxy. The oil crayons are terrible, totally waxy - no oil at all. Markers are OK (so far), but why provide two of each color with the same thin tip? They could have given a broad and thin tip marker in each color instead. The case does seem pretty sturdy, so worst case I'll replace the contents with better quality art supplies. I'm going to look around for something better... if I find it, this is going back to Toys R Us. Any ideas? 
I was not very pleased with this art kit. The caps to the markers do not stay on at all. The markers seemed dry almost from the beginning. The crayons and oil crayons are ok. And the wood case is very nice, but half the set is the markers and they look like they will dry out shortly. I was disappointed 
I love Step 2 products as they area well-made, easy to assemble (though the kitchen didn't require any), and well thought out. This has a great telephone that rings, the look is cute, and it fit's nicely in the corner of my son's room. Now he can be a Top Chef all day long. 
My twin daughters got one of these kitchens for Christmas! They love this kitchen. It is not as tall as some of the others on the market which is a feature that I love!! My girls play with this all of the time and it is small enough that I have it set up in the kitchen so that they can pretend that they are cooking while I make dinner. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a kitchen for a toddler. IT is well built and stays clean 
My daughter received this for Christmas when she was 20 months. She loves it!!!!!! It is the perfect size for her and she is now a tall 2 year old. It is conveniently one piece and very durable. Easy to clean.You will need to buy some food and pots and pans as it does not come with any. Highly recommend for any little tot 
I got this toy 3 years ago when my oldest was [...] now she is almost [...] and still plays with it all the time but now she shares it with her [...] sister who also loves it as well. no fancy gadgets or lots of lights but it lets the imagination run wild 
I purchased this item for my 2 year old toddler. She loves playing in the kitchen while I prepare meals. She's able to manipulate and open all the compartments with ease. This was a great buy 
I bought this gift for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She really loves this kitchen. Abby Reese spends hours and hours cooking up a storm with this fridge. She is so imaginitive - I love how it teaches her pretend play. This kitchen is very compact - fits almost anywhere. I'd recommend this kitchen to anyone 
My daughter got this kitchen for her second B'day. She loves it, I have watched her imagination grow as she pretends to cook. She even uses the different compartments to hide treasures. It is very sturdy and well made. Loved that it came completely assembled. I highly reccomend this kitchen. Only wished it had come with some pots or food 
We gave this toy to our son for Christmas when he was 7 months old and he just loved it and still does at almost a 1 year old. It was fun watching his motor skills improve while using this toy. At first he mostly banged the noise making nails and did really grasp the ball dropping, storage compartment, crank or spinning ball. Little by little he added what he could do with this toy. Soon he was able to get the balls out of the compartment and drop them in the bottom hole, then soon in the top hole. He now wails with the little plastic hammer on the nails and just loves it. We haven't had to replace the batteries yet. I highly recommend this toy for developing motor skills 
My one year olds twins received this for Christmas along with the Discover Sounds Kitchen. My daughter sticks her hand down the ball drop hole to pick up a ball instead of getting a ball from the side pocket. Once she has the ball in her hand, she cannot get her hand back out and hasn't figured out to drop the ball. This has happened three different times. Once, she walked off dragging the workshop behind her until I caught up with her. She was not injured, but was very upset. I sit right next to her when she is playing with the workshop, or put it up. My twins use the Discover Sounds Kitchen more often and we have not had any problems with it. 
My 11 month old son received this for Christmas. He loves it, and goes to it more than all the other toys he got for christmas. Easy for little fingers, entertaining, and great for practicing fine motor-- pounding, pushing, turning. Little Tykes really hit the mark on this one! Much better than the kitchen that my daughter had 
Just wanted to write a quick review. We have the older version - we purchased it for our daughter when she was 9months and that was in 2001!! And at 4 she was STILL playing with it! It has always been a favorite of hers. Sometimes we have put it away because I thought she wasn't interested in it anymore, but when she discovers it or it comes back out, she won't stop playing with it. 
My son received this workshop at about 8 months still plays with it all the time at 19 months. He mostly enjoys dropping the balls through the chute cramming things into the overhead compartment. We also bought the Discover Sounds hammer that is sold as an accessory, but it was really too heavy for him to use at first. He still doesn't pay that much attention to it. The light-weight hammer that comes with the workshop is just fine. The workshop is durable also. My daughter sits on the nails, so far it has held up well 
We have the Discover Sounds Kitchen (which is great) so I decided to try this toy. It is not nearly as interesting as the kitchen but the girls do enjoy the ball drop and the nails. I think it's a decent toy for the price, but I wish it had more interesting parts to it. 
This was the first real toy we bought my son (other than real baby toys), he was 6 months at the time. From the moment we brought it home, he LOVED it! It comes with three balls that you drop in a slot and they come rolling out - he never got into that part even to this day but he loved and loves hitting the different parts of the workbench with the hammer and hearing the sounds and seeing the lights flash. It also has a winding crank and some other great little features that kids love. Now he is 20 months and although it's no longer one of the main toys he plays with I do see him go over and give it a whirl here and there and I still see the same excitment in his eyes just like the first time. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get rid of this toy not because my son is so attached but because I am attached to the memories of his very first toy and would hate to see it go 
My son received this toy for Christmas last year when he was 9 months old. He is now 18 months old and still doesn't play with it. It just doesn't hold his interest. ON the other hand, he could play all; day with the plain old Little Tikes workbench. This is definitely not worth the money - there are more entertaining work bench toys out there 
My kids (6,5 and 3) all love this puzzle. We all enjoy the art work on the letters being different than the normal examples ( Y has yarn, N has nuts). My daughter just leaves this puzzle out on her shelf because she likes to look at it. My 6 year old still likes it because it is not as babyish as most alphabet puzzles. We have had this puzzle for 5 years and have had no problems with wear and tear issues 
In shopping for puzzles over the last few years I've noticed that the manufacture's age recommendations seem to be a bit off. When puzzles are too advanced, the simple solution is to put it up for a later date; however, when they are too simple, they're a waste of money. Unfortunately, the Alphabet Art Puzzle was one of those disappointments. The puzzle encourages thinking, and matching, but I'm not sure it helped to teach the alphabet. In addition, some of the images are too goofy for this age group. For instance, a piece of Rope is shaped into the letter "R," but a 3-year old don't associate with such a thing. Another example of this, is the letter "Y" for Yarn. Wouldn't a Yo Yo be a better solution? The raised pieces do offer a new motor challenge from plastic knobs, but they are too shallow for the board. I can't seem to move this puzzle without dropping several pieces on the floor. My son found this frustrating as well. What's more, I think the age recommendation needs to be adjusted. I purchased the Alphabet Art Puzzle when my son was 2-years and 4-months old. It's recommended for children 3-years and up, so I thought it would make a good choice. It didn't challenge him at all. The second time he worked it, he completed it in less than 4-minutes by himself. That said, my son has benefited from the puzzle. He likes working it, and continues to ask questions about the pictures. I recommend it for children 18-months and up, as they will find it more challenging than a 3-year old. 
This puzzle is one of my favorite gifts to give all the youngsters in my life. I've given it as a shower gift, a birthday present, and a Christmas present, and the kids have all loved it. It has held up very well, even with a few pretty destructive types. It's very visually engaging, and most kids can figure out what most of the pictures represent. Only a few are tricky. Overall, I highly recommend this puzzle 
My now 2 year old began playing with this puzzle (which was handed down from his old brother) when he was about 12 months old. By the time he was 15 months old, he knew all his letters! 
This puzzle is one of the best we have found for age 18m - 3.5 yrs. It is now being used by our second child and is in great condition, very sturdy wooden pieces. It is fabulous for learning all sorts of things - the alphabet, hand coordination, new words, and you can use it to play I Spy as well. It's visually appealing as well 
I am so glad I bought this puzzle for my 3 year old! The pieces have the most beautiful pictures on them and the larger sized pieces are just right for toddler hands. This is one of those toys that you'll want to keep forever 
I must admit I am biased toward Lights, Camera, Interaction toys. My daughter has several of this line's toys and for the greater part we have been very pleased with the durability and educational factor of their products. The same goes for this alphabet puzzle. Even though the raised letters do not have pegs they are easily removed from the board. I like that the examples for the letters are not your general toddler "cat" and "balloon" icons, which broaden their understanding of the letters. I sing the "ABC" song to my daughter while I point to the letters and then practice pronouncing the words to the pictures and alphabet. A great hands-on way for little ones to learn the alphabet besides from the TV 
This is the game that comes out first at family holiday gatherings. It is easily modified for the younger age group gets them thinking in ways other than the usual children's game. My 4 6 year old grandchildren love it I recently purchased it for my daughter-in-law as a birthday gift. However, the timer is not well constructed it broke very soon after purchase on both my game others I have purchased for friends. It is a hard game to find but Amazon has come through on more than one occassion 
The play of the game itself is great -- similar to Scattergories in that you'll be coming up with words that fit a certain category and are looking for them to start with certain letters of the alphabet, but with several twists that make it even more entertaining. The one beef I really had with this game is that the deck of available categories is too small -- in just two or three games you'll begin to repeat categories. So, you may wish to augment the deck with categories of your own 
Three of us sat down and decided to try this game and we ended up playing for 4 hours. It is very easy to learn and yet challenging to play. Oh, it's also a lot of fun 
This is one game that the kids - and the adults - ask to play agian and again. It's a must on our family vacations -- one of the few things everyone can agree on. Easy and very fun to play. Highly recommende 
I purchased this game 5 years ago and have been searching for more because all my family and friends wanted their own copies! We were familiar with Fundex toys (Phase 10) and wanted a family game that ages 6-86 could play together and THIS IS THAT GAME! The rules are easy, the game is never the same, everyone has fun 
It is really expensive for what it is. I have to say my children love it, esspecially since we can put it in the middle of the table and everyone can take what they need from it. I love that when we are done you can put everything back and stick it on a shelf. However, for the supplies you get it IS expensive. The tote itself is nice but not worth more than $5, add the supplies to it, maybe I could see spending $10. However, if you catch it on sale I would pick up a few, they make great gifts 
My 3 year old daughter loves art. She found this in a toy store and I did not want to buy it because it was a little pricey for art supplies. But she has really enjoyed this. It has a little bit of everything in it. She has used up almost everything in it. But she still uses it to organize her other arts and crafts stuff 
I purchased this book when we took the kids (10, 8 and 8) to visit the Louvre this summer so they would have some idea why we were wandering around that vast building. Little did I know that it would spark an interest in my 8 year old son that borders on the obsessive. He has read the book two dozen times, spouts off all kinds of interesting facts about the artists and the times, and studies the paintings intently (this from a kid who has no artistic talent at all and whose favorite pasttime is sparring with his brother). The stories behind the paintings, the odd facts about the artists and the practices of the Renaissance period, are all presented in a compelling way with beautiful illustrations to boot. I recommend this highly readable and entertaining book 
Wow! My kids(8yo and 5yo)love to play this game~ They really enjoy this version of Go Fish~ We have all been enjoying the thrill of recognition when we see these artist's works in other places~ Well worth the money 
My daughter LOVED the color pencils and sketch pad that comes with this set. The crayons, however, did not survive the shipping, and those that did broke shortly afterwards with first use by my seven-year-old. Overall, a lovely kit, but crayons are not as well crafted as rest of the kit. 
All our children love temporary tattoos. This one is special because you can color them yourself. We purchased this for my son's 7th birthday and it was a great birthday activity for all. Needless to say, I the rest of our guests were covered in art when the day was through. The tattoos stay fairly well if you don't get scrubbing them too hard are easy to put on, they don't stick and peel like some we've tried. They offer varied styles of tattoos, everything from dragons to sports. All in all this is great fun! 
I do wish there were a few more tatoos in this kit, but you can continue to use the markers and draw free hand tattos when they are gone. They were easy to apply and fun to color in for the kids. I was a little skeptical after reading a few of the reviews, but I am glad I decided to purchase this anyway. 
Tattoos are really nice, but the ink part (markers) wash off easily. The black tattoo outline seems to last several days 
Grandchild loved this gift. Her and her friends made tattoos for everyone. There were so many styles to choose from and they really lasted. Would buy again in a minute. 
My mom bought this set for my four year old son last week. At first I thought it might be a little advanced for him, but he got the hang of it in no time. Now he is tattooing the whole family. They are pretty easy to rub off, but that's probably a good thing, since he covered my daughter's face with flowers right after she got out of the bath! For the price, this is a great toy 
I did A LOT of research on the Internet regarding play food before I bought this set. This set offers the largest variety of foods, covering all of the food groups, with minimal amount of desserts (I want a healthy eater). This play food set has eggplant, cauliflower, asparagus, chicken, steak, ham, hot dogs, hamburger, bacon, pineapple, lemon, honeydew and musk melons, any many more items - an incredible selection of foods. I received exactly what was shown in the picture on the Internet. The food is very high quality and just the right size for a play kitchen to fit on the play plates. My daughter, husband and I have a great time with this food. She loves making us breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. She also likes to put it in her shopping cart that we had purchased separately and ring the food up with a pretend cash register. As for comments on the packaging...packaging costs money which is built into the cost of the food. That is why this food doesn't cost a lot, because Step 2 saves money on packaging. Plus most people toss packaging anyways after opening an item. The packaging is clear plastic so you can see all of the items. This set has a larger variety of food than Little Tikes, Fisher Price, and Just Like Home (I never saw anything about Kid Connection play food during my research). The person who received 8 hot dogs, 12 french fries, etc. should contact Step 2 and ask for a reship. There must have been a mistake made when packaging was done (probably a rush for holidays orders). You should get exactly what is shown on the Internet. I hope this review helps everyone. Have fun with this food! It is a GREAT buy!! 
I agree with a previous review that you get what you pay for. But in the future I would highly recommend paying more once instead of having to replace this food in a few months or so. We received this as a gift and from the outside it looked like an great choice! I was very happy. But we have had this package of food for about one week and I am already taping boxes with packaging tape to keep them together. Little hands can pull apart the milk, juice and snack boxes in no time. The cans of food are so small that they topple over easily in the play kitchen. The pies, pizza, and such food are all actually hollow underneath. There is no base to them. They tell you 101 pieces but in our kit it counted 8 hotdogs (without buns), 12 individual french fries and the same on potato chips. Not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets in a french fry container and you get a hot dog in a bun separately. Why would my child want four jalepenos too. So much of this food is not they type of thing a small child would be familiar with. Anyway, in my opinion spend the money on a smaller quantity of higher quality food or go online and find the "vintage" Fisher Price or Little Tikes food. Now those are made to last and of good size for small hands. 
I love step2 products, my daughter is only 2 yrs old but we already have MANY of their items. We decided to get her the lifestyle deluxe kitchen for the holidays this year needed to get her some playfood to go along with it, I really wanted wooden sets but after spending over $200 on the kitchen I decided I'd go with the step2 plastic... big mistake! As another reviewer mentioned there is no retail packaging, they come in plastic bags. The plastic pieces are tiny, very thin, and sized strangely (ie a banana is smaller then an egg etc), the "boxes" are a joke, they are smaller and weaker then your typical snack size raisin box... I didn't even dare give them to my toddler as they'd have been ruined in 2 seconds. The "jars" are also very small and instead of interesting as one reviewer said they are just odd, disgusting sounding food items and very boring design. Having nothing else on hand I did give these to my daughter, she seems to like them well enough but I will be buying her some wooden playfoods soon and tossing these up on ebay or a garage sale. Not recommended 
If you are looking for play food that is like little tikes or fisher price, this is not it!! There is a reason you get 101 pieces for 19.99!! These pieces are much smaller and made from a thinner cheaper plastic. Not at all what i expected from a quality company like step 2. To top it off, this set does NOT come in a retail box but is cheaply packaged in plastic bags. I am sure my daughter doesn't mind these are cheaply made or small but i sure as heck do. I could have bought a Kidconnection set from walmart for less money and maybe even of better quality 
My daughter was 2 1/2 when I gave this to her. I use it to teach her food groups and to encourage her to taste the real version. Pretend "invisible" food is fun, but for a little one who has a lot to learn about different foods, to touch and to see is worth 1000 words! 
My daughter recieved this kitchen today, and she absolutely loves it! The bins on the left side really need a back on them so that things don't fall out. I would recommend putting this toy together with a ratchet equipped with a screwdriver bit adapter otherwise you will have a sore wrist because it takes a while to get the screws through the thick plastic parts. This toy is definately designed to be durable. I am sure it can withstand whatever my daughter could do to it. Overall I think it is a good investment and a very cute toy 
I bought this for my 2 year old. I was happy that it wasn't huge--fits right in the corner. She loved it when she first got it for Christmas. HOWEVER, My complaints are...everything is just SO small and inefficient! The "microwave" is so high that she can't even reach it with a small stool I bought for her to use just for the kitchen! The back of the little bins are open, and you can't store ANYTHING in there. So, I don't know where they came up with the lots of storage line! I just expected a little bit more of a kitchen--would have changed some of the features. OVERALL it has proven to be a fun toy, but hard to use unless you are really tall 
I bought this kitchen for my daughter on her 2nd birthday. She didn't seem very interested at first and I just figured it would take time for her to like it. I showed her how to play with it and how the sounds work but she was still very uninterested. I think she needs to be a little bit older to fully enjoy it. She plays with it as long as someone is in there playing with her. She can't reach the top shelf yet and gets upset everytime something is placed up there. To tell you the truth my 4 year old sone LOVES it. He loves to pretend to cook things and clean the dishes. This kitchen has withstood my daughter climbing all over it, my husband falling on it and my son standing on it. It is a tough toy! I love that it is so small... it doesn't take up a whole room like most other kitchens and I love that it can be moved easily. I would recommend this toy for anyone who is shopping for a 3 year old or older. I am sure my daughter will enjoy it more once she is a little bit older 
My daughter is 1 and she loves it would be nice to come with a little more food but overall it's great and my 8 year old son thinks so to a great starter kitchen.......... 
I bought this for my 19 month old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She seems a little young and I was skeptical but she has older siblings who enjoy it with her. She is just a tad too short to open the microwave easily but it won't take long until that is a non issue. The stove button is easy to work and she loves the cooking noises, which are not annoying like so many other toy noises. I know I can trust it to last since it is Little Tyke. It is great for those of us who don't have much extra space as it takes up almost none yet has plenty of things to play with. It is also great that it comes with a few items to start out with 
I purchased this kitchen for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived and I started to assemble it only to find a few minor manufacturer defects on one of the pieces that compramised the way it assembled and the way it would "wear" over time. I called Little Tikes' customer service phone number and after explaining the problem they said they would send me a new part immediately. I haven't received it just yet but they said they would try to get it here before Christmas. I was dissappointed when I found the defect and was certain, that with one week remaining before Christmas, that I would have difficulty getting someone to respond to my request for help. I spoke to the nicest man at Little Tikes and was SO impressed at how the company stood behind it's product and sent the needed part with absolutely NO HASSLE! They didn't require me to prove that the part was defective or even return it to them.....they simply took my word for it. I am impressed, more than ever, that the Little Tikes company appreciates their customers......even it they aren't making "large" purchases. This is not one of their most expensive kitchens and yet they still stood behind the quality of their product!! I'll try to update this review once I've recieved the new part and the entire transaction is complete. 
I only have one complaint and that is that the back of the "cubby" holes is completely open and there is now way to place things inside without them falling out behind it. Other than that this was great for my daughter's 2nd birthday. We don't have a lot of room and this is the perfect size. She just loves to turn the knob on the stove and hear the sounds. 
My son's 4th birthday is tomorrow, Sept. 17, and he said he really wanted a kitchen. I wanted to get him a more expensive Step 2 one but he insisted he liked this one the best. (I think he loved the idea of the real towel) I just finished putting it together which was very easy but getting the oven and fridge doors on was a little annoying and they don't close completely u have to push a little to get them closed so I don't know if that will frustrate my son.....we'll see. In the directions it tells u to dab a little dish detergent on the the oven knob to make pushing it in easier, well I saved this part for last and had to use all my might to get the knob on! I don't understand why they can't just attatch the little knob when they making these but oh well. My son will be using this tomorrow and I'll get back with an update! I would also recommend u putting it together before your child knows u got it for them 
We have had 2 of these toys - they both had the same problem as others - only says "red pan in/out" If you slam it hard on the floor it occasionally will sing, but this is also random. The fisher-price rep. did not seem surprised when I called to report this - told me to keep the toy I had sent me a voucher for a new toy. 
I bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old. She has played with it absolutely everyday since then (she is now a year). At six months she didn't really play with it the way it's meant to be played but she enjoyed banging the pans around and listening to the music. Now she works on stacking them and using the shape sorter. Great toy to grow with 
Parents find the songs really annoying!! :) My baby thinks this is the greatest toy ever! He is 10 months old and had these for about two months so far. He loves taking the pots out and putting them back and getting them to play music, over and over and over and over.... We do have to put it away every once in a while so it doesn't drive us crazy, but for baby, it's great! 
My seven month old thinks the pots and pans are the best thing ever, and I'd definitely rather he bang on the plastic ones than real ones. But I have to say that the songs are a little irritating and I find them running through my head when I'm trying to sleep 
This toy taught my son how to stack in a day. It is such a cute toy, and my son loves to beat everything with it. It has cute, silly songs, and as far as our toy goes it plays very easy. The only thing I don't like is the spoon, because it doesn't have a place. If you put it in the pot then you aren't able the sort the blocks. Overall, it's a good toy! 
My son loved the learning table so I really thought the pots and pans would be a big hit when I purchased them when my son was 8 mo old. I could not get the product to say anything but, "Red pan in, Red pan out". I called the hotline at Fisher Price and they told me to change the battery which I had already done. While I was on the phone, my son dropped the pot and it began to sing the alphabet song. The cust. service rep. told me that the pots said and sang things at random and that it reponds when manipulated like a child would. I was disapointed because the toy responds VERY randomly and usually only sings if it is shaken very hard or dropped. I really feel I wasted my money on this one 
I bought this because she is at that age of stacking things. I thought this would be perfect for her. However it is not enough. There is only two things to stack and the spoon doesn't really have a place for it. Also the numbers on it doesn't have any interaction with it, meaning it is just printed on the toy and that is it. The sorting of the shapes are a great idea however and it is very durable. She will bang on it with the spoon as well. I guess for the price I was disappointed. But she does have fun with it 
From reading all reviews on different toys it will still come down to the individual child.. my little man got it for christmas at 8.5mths.. he does like it.. he takes them apart. and shakes the pot with the balls in it.. he also loves just pressing the button..that makes it talk.. overall not bad for the price.. 
My son had a great time playing with this toy. I liked the durability ( it made it through Christmas ) 
I've got this thing for my twins for NE=ew Year, and they've been enjoying it for one day so far. We have two sets, and it's much more fun than just one - going one shooter against two robots is indeed a deathwish. I don't know how durable it will prove - the robots suffered some tumbles without ill effects, but it's only been one day. One drawback I found is the toy's inability to go shooter on shooter - for some reasons pistols, when set on team A and team B, refuse to shoot one another. But it's a fun toy nevertheless. The only educational value I can discern in this set is a little bit of understanding of just how stupid the computers are, and may be the realization that the light "bullet" gets reflected off white surfaces, so the robot canshoot you even when its back is turned toward you. Otherwise, not eductaional at all. Thankfully :) 
We got this for my daughter's 3rd birthday and it is such a hit! We have had NO issues with the chalkboard thankfully. It was really simple to assemble and is very sturdy. She will be able to use this item for many years to come! 
I bought this easel as part of the classroom I set up for my preschooler. I love the adjustable size, durability and ease of use. My only complaint was the chalkboard. Though I followed the priming instructions diligently, I found that even the good chalk scratched the board and did not write well. Melissa and Doug did reply immediately to my concern and were willing to do whatever necessary to correct the problem. On a whim, I decided to try some chalkboard paint instead. It now writes beautifully, and I love the black chalkboard, rather than the green it came as. It is perfect 
I bought this item for my 3 year old daughter and had the same problem with the chalkboard (not working so well). I call the 800 number on the back of the box and the people in customer service sent me a new chalkboard. I was amazed at how helpful they were and the desire they had to make me happy. I will buy Melissa and Doug toys for years to come. 
After priming the board as the instructions indicated...it is still useless. The chalk actually cuts into the chalkboard so now, my daughter who loved chalk and drawing can't use that side of the easel. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone if they are looking for a product that does what it is supposed to do. I wonder if the makers even tried to use it...why would someone make a product that doesn't work and then expect people to buy it...very disappointing 
My daughter received this for her third birthday. She loves it. I would have to agree with another insert that the chalkboard does not work so well. The dry erase, however is wonderful! I cannot wait to get the paper so that she can start painting next! I would recommend this to three and above. There are some small pieces and the height could pose an issue for smaller children. But overall, GREAT Product! Only downfall, is the they do not provide even a few sheets of paper to get you started and chalk/eraser etc. 
We bought this for our five year old, and it has made art projects much more enjoyable for him. Melissa Doug make a variety of very traditional children's products and their easel is perfect. It wasn't too hard to put it together (30 minutes), it is sturdy and has nice features. The ability to use a paper roll (paper not included) and to easily tear off pictures is very nice. The one complaint we have is that Amazon charges over twenty dollars for standard shipping. If you take a few minutes to look around on line, you can find the same easel and have it shipped for about a third the cost. In summary, the easel is worth every penney, but you should try to avoid over paying on the shipping 
Amazon just raised the price on this within the last few days. Go to your local bookstore where it lists for $19.99. Awesome product, kids love it 
We bought this for our 10 year old grandson last Christmas and he LOVED it. He is interested in animals and he wrote a book about 'dangerous' animals. He had a great time doing it. The finished product is great. His parents had another copy of the book printed by the seller and sent it to us as a gift. We will always cherish it 
My 7 year old received this as a Christmas present. She was so excited to write her own book, we added the about the Author page and she wrote and illustrated the story. We bought one book for our family and the second book we dedicated to her school teachers and gave it to the school on Teacher Appreciation Day with a note that we wanted the book to be placed in the library. Now all of my daughters friends and others can check the book out of the library and they love it! I highly recommend this as a gift to anyone 
I bought this kit for my 6 year old daughter. She couldn't wait to start drawing. She dictated the story for each page and drew extra "love notes" on the remaining pages, and even deticated it to her Nan Nan. We opted to add the "About the auther" with a photo! My daughter did get impatient waiting for the book to come back,.. but since Katrina the mail has been very unreliable. Finally, her package arrived and she LOVED it! We rushed it right over to her Nan Nan. It is a perfect little book, that will be cherished forever. I've already bought 2 more! 
Great idea! The bound book is sweet, not cheesy at all, nice quality. Makes a great gift for grandparents. My teenagers even enjoyed making them. 
This is a nice idea, though basically they take the same paper that you draw on and bind it. We wanted more pages, and better quality paper than the thin paper they provide, but that cost us an additonal fee to upgrade when we sent the pages in. It did come out very nicely, and my 7 year old is very proud of her work. Overall we were happy, and unlike many other presents, this one was fun and left us with something she can show her friends and look back at later in life 
I would have rated this lower, but the idea is so great. My 7yo loves his book. Be careful w/ the pages you submit. We ordered two books and the first book contains the original submitted pages w/ artwork (except the cover which was scanned and reprinted on "glossy" paper). The 2nd book was, of course, all photocopied pages of the first. They simply take your submitted artwork pages and someone (or possibly an OCR), prints your submitted text just under your drawings; then binds the pages into the book, with the title page , dedication page, etc. Not as sturdy a book as I thought it should be, but as I said, my kid loves it, so that's what matters most. &lt;grin 
My Granddaughter age 9 had so much fun making up her own story, she is still working on the art and then we will have it printed 
This is a fun toy to have around, especially for boys and men who think they're boys! Better get yours from Amazon. I have a hunch Toys R Us will sell out quickly. Here's to the little kid in all of us 
My three year old grips these perfectly. And the array of colors make them such an enticing reason to try to learn to write. A great set of markers. Really really great 
This made our 6 year old so happy! Great colors, great markers 
This set is perfect for a younger child! Having 100 markers to work with is great. I know when I was younger, I loved having little carrying cases for eveything to keep organized...I wish I had had this cute little case when I was 5 
My almost 6-year-old son loves drawing and coloring, and this special set is perfect for him. In addition to having *100 different colors* (!) the markers are small with a thin tip. They fit his hands well and he loves having so many colors to choose from. We have had this set for several months and none have dried out or given him any problems. The case is perfect. It is sturdy plastic, snaps shut and has a handle. These are more "grown up" than the Crayola markers and have a much finer tip than even their skinny ones, so they are great for words and small details. We love this set 
We bought this set over a year ago and my daughter is still carrying it with her everywhere. Most marker sets you find in stores only have 24 or 36 colors. Here you have 100 colors to choose from. They come in a zippered case that opens into a full circle of markers arrayed in a beautiful rainbow. Each marker pops into the case so they all have a place and you can instantly see if one is missing. The markers have withstood endless pictures but are now getting a bit dry so we are replacing them. For $15 it seriously may be the #1 value of all the toys we have ever purchased for our children over the years. 
Very interesting spoof of the original game. I found the first one boring after a few plays, but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays. It's a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth it 
After I saw the advertisement for Clue DVD I immediately went out to buy it. I've always been a fan of Clue and this updated version provides players with some new twists and excellent graphics. While you are playing the game, the Butler and an Inspector often appear to provide you with Clues about the case. Another addition to the game is added locations and having to figure the time of the crime. Any Clue fan will appreciate this version 
I always thought Clue looked like a complicated game I'd never touch! That is until I played it at my friends house! Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions! This game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time! I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older 
This is an extremely fun and addictive game. You shuffle the cards, and place three (room, weapon, person) in the secret envelope. In every room you go into, you can make accusations. If someone has the card you accused (like the room), then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad. The game changes constantly, so it never gets boring. The character pieces have teeny details, like Mr. Green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. I gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really THINK. Oh, and good problem-solving skills too. And coordination (you have to add all the clues up to see who did it). All in all, a terrific game. Great for rainy days or playdates. And did I mention the weapons? Very realistic. And cute 
This was a little difficult to figure out in the beginning - Actually had to read the instructions - but it was very fun and very disney. Fam loves it 
My son received this game for Christmas and it is by far his favorite game. He enjoys pretending to be a detective and the game is easy enough for him to play and understand. I just have to figure out how to get more of the scoring sheets 
I bought this game long time ago but unfortunately all my friends were busy until X'mas. There were 5 of us and once we started playing, we were all addicted! I have heard from some other friends commented Clue was a boring game, but we all found it fun and challenging! Apart from strict logic thinking, the keys to win were to ask the right question and make a good, well organised notes! Last time we played we had 5 players, so some of us got 4 cards in hand and some got only 3 in hands. That was a bit unfair because the players with 4 cards had more clues in the beginning and so their chances of winning were higher. So we tried in one game to open 3 cards on the table, the game was finished a lot more quickly. But we all found that it was less challenging. Overall, great game!! Train you brain in logic thinking as much as Sudoku and Mastermind 
I purchased this set for my daughter as a christmas gift because she saw it while I was browsing online and told me how much she wanted the "puppies". She will love this! The set is much larger than I expected it to be and looks sturdy enough for my 5 year old to play with 
My daughter got this for a birthday gift and has really likes playing with it. She loves palying with animals and this was a perfect fit to the doll house she recieved for Christmas. She is still playing with it several months later 
These dogs are adorable and are a cute addition to the dollhouse set. My daughter sends the other pets outside to play with this set. Plays with them as much as the people. Great addition 
My daughter received the loving doll house for Christmas and LOVED it, however our family consist of Mommy, Daddy, girl, boy and a golden retriever. When I spotted this item I was so happy to see I could duplicat my daughters real life family. She absolutly loved it. She actually played with just the dogs and accessories for 3 days. It was hard to find in stores so I just ordered it from amazon/toysrus. It was out of stock so she did not get it until after Christmas, but that was ok she said "more presents" when it came in the mail 
Great accessory to the dollhouse for the price. It has lots of parts to teach your child about pet care, feeding, and bathing 
Every child I know loves animals and this is no exception. My three-year-old granddaughter loves to have the puppies get nurtured by the mother dog in her dollhouse. She loves to brush the mother dog's "fur" too. I sometimes play with her and we talk about how to treat animals gently and with kindness. I see her using these traits in her role play with this set. Everything about this set is durable. There is even a sack of dog food and a water dish to remind little ones that all animals need to be taken care of. When I sometimes watch my granddaughter, she will always notice when his food or water dish is empty and come tell me. I notice her giving her "pets" the same consideration. I love this set and so does she! 
A varry good board game.I played it for the first time over the weekend.Another game we like is strippopoly 5 stars for them bot 
We had so much fun with this game. There are truth or dares and all sorts of fun questions! I definatly recommend this game if you are having a party or even just a few people who want to have a good time! Totally worth buying this one 
If you and your friends are just too crazy for conventional board games, give I've Never - The Game of Truth a try. The object of the game is simple, players move around the board answering highly personal and potentially defamatory questions, and take shots or drink beer while playing. The questions are formatted as "I've Never...." (for example, "I've never been skinny-dipping"). If this is true for you, you get to move forward the designated number of spaces. If it's false, you pay the consequence (generally you must take a drink). Some spaces on the game board automatically force you to drink. Many people will find the questions far too offensive and overly personal, and will be uncomfortable playing this game. If this is you, don't feel bad, you're not the only one. However, in a group of close friends, this game can be a total laugh riot. This game is perfect for a Bachelor or Bachelorette party, or just a regular party with a group of friends who are as crazy as you are 
This is the most hilarious board game you could ever play! It's great at your next party, family gathering, or get together with close friends. I was completely entertained and enthralled with the secrets that were revealed about some of the people closest to me. I learned things about my brother-in-law, for instance, that I just never would have believed! What a nut! Just a fun, amusing, down to earth game to play; I've played it numerous times, both with people who have played before, and newcomers, and it only get's better each time. And of course, it incorporates drinking in a way that only makes it more enjoyable. The secrets really start coming out only after a few turns. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good board game and a lot of laughs 
The first time I played this game was with my co-workers at Happy Hour and then again with my family members on our summer vacation at the beach house. Although we were already close and "thought" we knew a lot about each other-this game only made us closer. I don't remember laughing as hard as I did once secrets started to become revealed. The next morning at breakfast, no one could even make eye contact without laughing! This game is perfect to play with a group of friends or family and will keep you laughing all the way thru! It would make a perfect holiday gift-I highly recommend purchasing this game if you are up for some laughs! 
Hey, I just wanted to write in a review for this game because I loved it so much. I just ordered it less than a week ago, and it is already here, no problems, with a great price for an unbelievable game. The game consists of 100 I've Never cards (10 which you make up on your own) and each one is more hilarious than the next. I played with a bunch of my college friends and was drunk before I even rolled the dice (the way we all want it to be). Looking for a great game to play and learn all the unspoken truth of your friends, then definately test out this game, I highly reccomend this 
I bought this for my son who is 2 1/2. He loves it. He had to show "peepaw", his grandfather who has a real one. Anytime he's outside he gets it out to ride on. He has several other "ride-on" toys and prefers this one over most of them. He has the Little Tikes Police Car Coupe, and Step 2 Tricycle, the Zip N' zoom car, a radio flyer tricycle and a fisher price quad. The only thing I found is if he leans too much to one side it will tip over. It's pretty sturdy otherwise. Put a little helmet on for safety (just like the adults do on our motorcycycles) and you little one will be just fine 
I bought this for my 2yr old grandson for his birthday so he could have a motorcycle like his Grandma. He LOVED it! The wheels are wide enough to keep it from tipping and it's light enough and just the right size to throw in the car to take along. He has to make his own "motor noise", but that's a plus in my book. No batteries to replace or noises to annoy! Also his very tall 3 1/2 year old brother can ride it comfortably, so I look for it to last a long time 
Step 2 is a fantastic brand, slowly climbing up the ladder alongside Fisher Price, Little Tikes etc. My kid loves motorcycle's, so what better toy to buy than his own ride-on motorcycle! This toy is extremely durable. It might take kids a while to get used to balancing the bike, so that it doesn't topple over - but scrapes and bruises are part of growing up! The bike is a little taller than I thought it would be, which meant that my child was on tiptoes for the first couple of months - but its a strong, cheap and exciting toy for any kid 
We actually got this motorcylce from a neighbor who didn't want it anymore. My daughter was very excited and so was I until she tried to ride it on the sidewalk. It fell right over and she scraped her arm. She's tried several times, but the balance is so off that she can't just sit and go. I'm glad I didn't pay for it 
Most ride on toys are very wide, which make the pushing a little hard. This toy is thin; therefore, my 2 yr old son loves it more than any other push toy. This is so so cute, I wish there was more stickers, but who cares, it is worth the buy! I hated paying for the 8-9 dollar shipping, but motorcycles this cute are hard to find... This is light and easy to throw in the truck to take along 
This little motorcycle is cute. However, it's very lightweight and is similar in quality to a ride-on toy that could be purchased for much less at any discount retailer. The stickers do seem to be of high quality and to date, none have peeled off. The extreme shipping price added another $10 to the $19.99 price tag. This is definately not a $30 toy. 
My son got this for his second birthday and it is his absolute favorite toy ever! Next week is his THIRD birthday and he still plays with it every single day. He rides it in the house, outside down our sloped driveway and even takes it to the park. We actually had to make trails for him in the woods so he could go off-road with it! This toy definitely gets 5 stars in my book! It does sit a little high, but that makes it PERFECT for someone his age 
This product was nothing like how I expected it to be. The quality is terrible, do not waste your money on this item 
I-Dog is so fun to use! All you have to do is plug the included cable into your digital player's headphone port and I-Dog will play your music through a tiny internal speaker. I-Dog's face will light up with various patterns and colored lights depending on what type of music you play. His tail serves as a mute button, but be careful because he doesn't like you touching too often! I-Dog will get sad if you don't give him any music to listen to. If you don't have a digital player, you can set I-dog by your boombox or other music device and he can "hear" that way. There are only two reasons why I didn't give I-Dog 5 stars: (1) The internal speaker isn't very loud, so you have to have your music player turned up quite high, and (2) the battery cover on I-Dog's back leg is really hard to get off. You will definitely need some kind of tiny screwdriver to get it off 
The iDog is very cute, but he takes a long time to get going and sucks batteries down in record time. Too bad, because he's a nice way to play your music. 
I love this little dog! I named him Max and he's just the cutest little critter and fun to watch listen to my music 
I just got my pink idog today and think it is just the cutest thing. Although I am just learning how to use it,so far I am just so interested in watching it's movements and colors. The problems that I have encountered are that it is quite difficult to "turn" the pup off and that the "on" button (nose) is much too sensitive. All you have to do is very lightly tap the nose and the pup makes noises. In addition, I have found that the batteries are a pain to insert as you need a screwdriver. I wish like my ipod, there was a "hold" button to avoid accidently activating the toy and "wasting" expensive batteries. I might make the investment and buy re-chargable ones to avoid the cost. Anyway, I look forwars to using it on desk at work 
I've been trying to get some sort of way to listen to my I-Pod without the earbuds. I was not going to spend $100 bucks on another boom box just for I-Pods. So it caught my attention while I was in Herbergers and noticed I could listen to music through the dog. It was cute so I grabbed it. You have to put two AA batteries in the dog's leg. Then you just plug in your I-Pod and instant music. The sound isn't as good as with a stereo system which makes this good for me since I live in a condo and do not want to make a lot of noise. The dog is cute and its head turns and its ears go up and down to the beat of the music. There are also lights that go on and off to the beat of the music too. It also cries and barks. That kinda gets annoying after awhile. It demands attention. And if you pull its tail it growls. You control the songs and volume through your I-Pod. This is a cute cheap way to listen to your I-Pod without spending a lot of money or a lot of hassle. 
I am so disappointed. I remember doing this as a child with far superior results. Why do they have to make toys so cheaply now. I would gladly pay more for a toy that actually does what it says. It does not spin fast enough to evenly distribute paint. My daughter has not seemed to mind yet and is enjoying the toy but knowing how it should operate I am very disappointed. 
This comes with barely enough paint for 2 uses and then no info is given on how to get refills and the store doesn't sell any and they don't even tell you what kind of paint to get. A real pain. 
The box said it came with 10 refillable paint containers, but ours only had 9 bottles, and one of those was empty. No matter, really, it's just a small amount of paint to start with, but why not give people what you tell them you will? The color selection is all right, but not super - you don't get ROYGBIV or anything. It may vary, of course, but we had a lot of light green. Some of them have glitter, which is extra cool and does a good job of making the whole picture sparkle if you add it last. It also comes with a small assortment (40 pieces) of paper -- in both large and small sizes -- of which you are encouraged to reserve the last one as a template to trace and make new ones. Poster board seems to be about the same thickness as the original paper. The smaller "bonus" machine will go fast if you pump the button down repeatedly. By doing this, it actually can go faster than the battery operated one and the paint distributes and spatters very well. The instruction manual, if you can call it that, is pretty limited. It shows in about 3 pictures how to put everything together and operate it. No tips or hints on how to make neat designs. It's the least detailed set of instructions I have seen with an art toy. It comes apart for easy rinsing/wiping. I've always done this immediately after the paint session, and the units are still as clean as they were the first time out of the box. My kids love it. They want to spin pictures every day 
We were very disappointed in this toy. It does not spin fast enough to make the paint spray evenly over the cardboard. My older children had a spin art toy that was great. It made the most spectacular designs. This is not worth the effort or money 
What a disappointment. The spinner just can't gain enough speed to do anything lilke what it is supposed to do. Overall, it's a cheap item with limited supplies for the $ 
The shuttle bay door will fall off in no time. The booster rockets will be next. The ability to stand it up on the launch pad will last a few days at best. And the robot arm is cheap garbage. This is my experience with a 4 year old boy, but it applies to all ages 
My 3 year old is very interested in space and LOVES this toy. Having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it----the payload doors don't really close, the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on. Meets the need for a realistic shuttle, though 
My son is very into space and rockets right now (he's 3) so I thought that he would like this toy. That is an understatement! He LOVES this toy. Every piece is well made and has supplied him with hours of imaginative and inventive play 
The description lies, there are no minifigures, Elite or otherwise, included. Unless you have money to spend for additional sets to get this vehicle a pilot, I wouldn't suggest it as anything other then a display peice. It's shiny though, and as far as I can tell mostly accurate to the game, if not to scale with the other things (This is a problem with all the minifigures...I suggest the 1/6 scale ones instead. 
This is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child. There are only two working buttons, one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker. There is some padding on the top, but not enough. The manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added. Overall not a good value at all for the price. 
I bought this helmet hoping that it would be big enough to fit an adult. I was pleasantly surprised when it was big enough to wear comfortably! While there is no headband or suspension, the inside is padded with foam, and the whole thing is light enough that it was very comfortable. Any helmet can get stuffy to wear, but the front visor opens up so much that it is very easy to breath, and you could wear this for hours. The electronics are an inside speaker that repeats the same sequence, and the microphone doesn't work, but the overall look is so good that it doesn't matter. I plan on putting together an astronaut suit for this, and it would be a perfect outfit for Halloween parties 
The entire play tent idea is a great idea. However, it does need a little more attention to the velcro snaps to attach the tunnels and tents together into one unit. It isn't durable enough for the price. I had it out for a day, and my daughter didn't last in it. She prefers the schoolbus instead. I can see this toy breaking down with tears very quickly because it is a little fragile 
My twin boys (16 months) love this toy. I would suggest getting at least 100 extra balls. (I have 250 in our ball pit and it really looks fun)) The connections aren't the best, but they work better than other company models that don't have velcro straps. Our kids play in this on and off most of the day. On a cautionary note, this is a fairly large system of tunnels and tents so make sure that you have plenty of room. Of course, you can use the pieces separately to make several smaller play spaces instead of one large area. Overall, I am glad I purchased this and that I didn't wait until the recommended 3 year old age range. 
I purchased this product for my 1-yr old daughter's birthday because she loves to crawl under and through anything. She loves this, too. My 3 sons (3, 7, 12) love it, too, even though the 7 and 12 are a little too big. Set up was very easy, although I have not tried to take it down. It is a little flimsy at the connection points, but not enough that I wouldn't recommend it. I would get more pieces to connect if I had a larger space 
My kids 4 and 6 both love this, I bought it for my 4 year olds birthday. I really liked the fact that it folded flat and was easy to store, however, my husband and I have yet to figure that out! 
We got this for our son about a month ago. He's almost 14 months now, younger than the recommended age of 3 years, but he is never unsupervised when using the playhut. Our son loves to play hide and seek (hiding from us, of course :))inside the playhut, or just going in and retrieving the balls we toss in there for him. He doesn't exactly know what to do with the basketball hoop yet, but I'm sure that will come. He has lost his balance while in the playhut and knocked it down, but it pops right back up. And, since we have it up against a wall, it is more stable anyway. Enjoy 
What a bunch of junk! Upon opening the Megaland, I noticed it was ripped at the seam in one area. This was a pretty large rip I might add. After inspecting it more I noticed about a dozen more places where it was ripped. I noticed another parent said the same thing. Now I know why it's half off! Don't waste your money. 
A little scary. I'm sure it's a fluke,but the one I bought the inside of one tent had an inseam not sewn around the metal frame of tent, therefore a portion of metal frame was available to toddler. Possibility of breaking and small metal pieces was all I could invision.Therefore I sent product back. The other 2 tents were in perfect condition, as was the 3 tunnels, so as I said,I'm sure it's a fluke, but didn't want to take a chance for my 2yr old 
This set up is a bit flimsy and the tunnels don't have anything to connect them to the tent. My son still loves it but I wish it was a bit more sturdy 
it is a good toy but the balls are rather small and youmust check the seams when they arrive for poor sowin 
We have had this shopping cart for 3 years now. I have 2 active girls who love to play with it. It does not show any wear after 3 years it has been rammed into walls and pushed down the stairs. I think it is very sturdy worth the money 
I've already spent way too much time trying to screw the basket in and hammer the wheel caps on. What a pain in the neck. This was the most expensive cart and I can't believe it's taking this long to put together - not worth it 
We bought this shopping cart for my daughter's birthday to replace the cheapie one she'd had before. Her previous one had cost under $10 (a gift) and there is no comparison between that one and the Little Tikes one. The old one was flimsy from the get go, faded quickly, and when it broke, left sharp edges in the plastic. The Little Tikes cart is much, much sturdier and safer. I put it together in less than 30 minutes, even with my daughter's 'help'. There's a nice deep basket that holds a good amount of pretend play food or whatever else your child wants to push around. The seat for a doll folds against the cart just like a real shopping cart, and easily holds a good variety of different style dolls. The empty shelf under the basket is a nice touch, perfect for stashing more groceries. This cart is definitely worth the extra money, and I'd gladly buy it again 
Let me start by saying my son has had this toy for over three years and it is his absolute favorite. Since he's had it so long I can tell you its very durable. We haven't had any problems. This is the one and only toy he has used every single day since we bought it. He uses it for pretty much everything, but especially for cleaning up. He uses it to gather up all of his toys and take them to his bedroom to put away. He also loves to use it to play store. The only problem with this toy: when his friends come over they want to play with it too! Maybe I should get a few more of them! I would highly recommend this toy to anyone! 
We had this grocery cart for three years. I would give the basket and base ten stars for sturdiness. After lots of play though, the wheels will no longer stay; I got tired of "popping" them back into place. Overall, three years has been a good lifetime for this toy 
Without a doubt, this is the best shopping cart available! 1. Sturdy 2. The little seat for a baby doll- easy to get baby doll in and out and it makes it more like the real thing. 3. Holds a ton of food. Both of our kids, 26 mo. girl and 15 mo. boy love this! 
We bought this cart for our 16 month old daughter and it's a hit. She loves pushing her "baby" in it and filling it with "groceries." I love that it's so sturdy compared to the others on the market and very hard to tip over. At first I wasn't thrilled about the price but I was sold after comparing it with the others. It's very durable and high quality. I know this one will last. 
This shopping cart is the perfect height for my daughter. My two boys even love to use it to cart around their cars and blocks! Highly recommended 
This product is fun for my 2 year old. She loves to push it around with her dolls riding inside. As for parents, It is an easy thing to use to help clean up toys as it has a decent sized basket and it rolls pretty easy 
I bought it for my niece, she love it, play with it instantly. I did not buy the accesories because she use any single toy she had and put on it 
I had a hard time finding dishes for someone under 3 years of age. these were perfect for a 2 year old. she really enjoys them, and loves making "soup Hot" for her daddy. it includes pots and pans and little a spatula and serving spoon so she learns how to use these things. It helps with dexterit 
NICE BABY GIFT FOR NEWBORN.....I ATTACHED A GIFT CERTIFICATE AND A BIG BOW ...EASY BABY SHOWER GIFT... 
We got this cube before my son was born. He has enjoyed playing with it since he was very small. First he would just look at it, then he started moving the flap with the bullseye and now he grabs all the different parts of it and really manipulates it. The different rings and sections to grab make this a great toy for a child learning to reach. My son is now six months old and he still enjoys this toy 
This is my son's favorite toy. He has been playing with it since he was a month old. He loves to here it jingle, and open the flap and see the panda bear. He is now 4 months old and it is still his favorite toy. I can give him this to play with in his bouncy seat and it keeps him occupied for a long time. I've also attached it to his baby gym and he loves grabbing at it. Highly reccommend it 
My baby got this when she was 6 weeks old. She was liking it by the time she was 2 months old. She now is 4 1/2 months old and still enjoys it. Great educational toy with the different colors and textures. Awesome for young baby 
Our 3 month daughter loves this toy. It has multiple shapes and colors for visual devlopment and enough different textures to keep her busy while I write this review. Very good product 
I know that the Amazon description says that this is for babies 3 months to 2 years, but I just had to buy this early after I read all of the great reviews. When it arrived, I attached it to the activity gym (I uploaded a photo of it if you are interested in seeing how I did this). My baby boy, Benjamin, immediately grabbed it. He was only 6 weeks old at the time, so I am sure that it was just a coincidence, but it made me feel bad that I had not offered him toys at a level he could reach before this. Throughout that first day, he became fascinated with the toy. He quickly learned how to grab (even though his depth perception is still off) and I believe that this toy helped him develop his "grabbing skills" faster than if I had not purchased this toy. I am sure that this toy is going to get a lot of use from my baby boy. He has now decided that it is more fun to kick it than to grab it. Personally, I believe that this toy should have a lower age recommendation. He was only half way there and I know I could have given it to him sooner. 
My 3 month old loves the cube. I attach it to whatever I can, it goes everywhere with us 
It is a very educating and entertaining toy; my baby is only 6 months old and he loves it! He shakes it and scratches it! 
This toy is a wonderful first toy. It captures their attention and has all kinds of handles for them to grab when they're ready! I absolutely love it, and so does my son 
My 6 yr. old son received this for Christmas. He loves it and so do I! I think he likes playing hang man the best. It's cool that it has a light so he can play at night 
Purchased the Batman Laptop Computer at Target for Christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old. He was totally drawn in because it is Batman....but the games kept his interest. The entire family enjoyed trying the different games. Dad, a musician, enjoyed the music game. Graphics are super... I love the way Batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right....and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red. Grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even. Worth the $38.99 I paid at Target on sale for sure. 
My 6 year son loves this! The sides open up, the lights come flashing on and it's easy to open. The games are fun and keeps him entertained for hours! I would definitely recommend 
I came across this item by accident while doing my Christmas shopping yesterday. Not only am I sure my 6 year old son will LOVE this...I LOVE IT! LOL! It is really cool. You push the top and it pops open while the wings shoot out. There is flashing lights and sounds. You have to put in any number of codes all beginning with BAT to access the games and activities. It has a keyboard on it just like a real laptop which I am thrilled with. Now my son can type on his computer instead of mine! LOL! I played with it myself for probably half an hour. Sure there are some things he wont be able to do but it wouldnt be much fun if he already knew how to do it. It is definately something that will be with him for awhile. The only small complaint I would have is that the screen could be bigger. For the size of the top of the laptop the actual screen that is used is very small. I dont see why they could not have utilized more of the screen and still had room to list the bat codes. Either way, I am sure any Batman fan would love this, any little boy will love this...and any mother who is looking for a cool, fun, EDUCATIONAL toy will LOVE this! The best part for me is the lights you can turn on. There is probably 2 or 3 settings for the lights that help you see the screen so much better. That is a great feature as well as the wings which dont really add much except that it will make any young boy think he has something Batman might actually use! I TOTALLY reccommend this "toy" for anyone with boys ages 5 to 7 or even 8 
I bought this computer for my just turned 5 year old. While he thinks it is really cool, it is a bit hard for him. Of the 26 games, he can play 6. I am happy that it is a toy he can grow with and it can teach him a lot. The graphics are great but I do wish the volume could be turned down one more setting. I do wish there was a setting that they could just type letters to learn the keypad. All in all, a good investment. 
Just wanted to let others know this info that I found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer about getting the table for a lot cheaper at Costco ... I called Costco and they carried the KIDKRAFT art table with two stools back in January of 2006, and will no longer be carrying it. You can find it at Walmart for $66 plus shipping, just check the website. The table is not the same however -- the dimensions are different, the sides of the tables is slightly different (on one side of the Kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in between the two cups, and the other side has a space where little legos can snap onto). The stools are also tiny compared to the ones that come with this table. Overall it looks a little less substantial, but since I haven't seen it in person, I really can't give my opinion. Hope that helps someone 
My two little girls , 2 and 3 years old, love this table and use every day. I bought it about a month ago and it is still their favourite toy. They love it so much they want to eat their meals at it also. It was expensive but well worth the money. I love the fact that there is enough space on the benches that their friends can sit and create. The table is also large enough that each child has their own drawing space 
I've seen this table in quite a few magazines and tossed the idea aside because of the price. I found the exact table, same brand and everything in Costco for $49.99. So of course I bought it and am glad I did. My kids love to do all of their projects on this table. It is durable and has plenty of room for my 3 kids to sit at. 
My 2y daughter received this on 2nd bday and she has not let it go since, (7mo). Dora "feeds" the baby bro/sis with the bottle in her hand, while it (bottle)makes good sound effects. There is also a pretend plate of carrots/peas/potatoes and comes with 2 spoons, very good role-modeling as Dora is the big sister. The songs she sings are very sweet, as both the songs and the questions she asks engage my daughter in fun role playing. 
My 2 yr. old daughter and I were at a store shopping for her birthday presents ( a little early ) and when she saw this dora doll with her baby sister and baby brother she wouldn't put it down, and since I bought it for her she has slept with her every night, this doll is practically attached to my daughter. Every time dora asks, "do the babies want some more?" after feeding them my daughter giggles and says "ok dora" it's amazing how she interacts with this doll. It's deffinatly worth the money to buy it! 
My daughter adores Dora and has been asking for this toy. She received it for Christmas and is thrilled. I love it because it is a very sturdy toy. The babies are heavy duty plastic and Dora is half plastic, half cloth. My daughter has been sleeping with the Dora. She is enjoying pretending to feed the babies and put them in Dora's carrier. This toy is great for play acting as well as wonderful if you are trying to get your child ready for a little brother or sister, although you might want to educate your child that they won't be able to carry their new sibling around in a carrier like Dora until they are much older 
I see most of the reviews come from mom's of 2 year old, but heck my 7 year old daughter just had to have this doll, and actually, her 3 year old brother just loves it too. They both like to cuddle and feed the babies! 
We bought this for my daughters 2nd Birthday. She loves it. She will sit and play with the babies for hours. She loves the bottle that comes with them. The only thing that i wish is the babies were softer. They are a very hard plastic and she loves cuddling with them. I think it would be easier for her if they wre soft and not hard. Other then that this doll is cute!! 
My daughter is 2 1/2 and she loves Dora. She loves playing with Dora and the babies 
I ordered three sets of these Dora dolls. They are the cutest thing I have seen. I know my 2 and 4 year old granddaughters will love them. They appear to be well made. Fabric stores carry fleece "Dora" material. I bought some and made doll blankets with it just by cutting a fringe around the outside. I can't wait until Christmas to see their eyes light up when they see the dolls with matching blankets 
My 4 year old daughter asks every day to have this Big Sister Dora for Christmas. I love it. She doesn't know I already have it hidden in the closet for her. She even drew an awesome picture of Dora holding both babies for Santa so he can get it just right. I loved this idea the second they came out with it. I love that it helps my daughter love her role in our family as "Big Sister." What a positive idea! Who doesn't need more excitement to help their child welcome a sibling into the world? I love too, that there are twin babies. My daughter is already planning to share one of the babies with her little sister. Although, we only have 2 girls at this time, they know that someday we can welcome a new little brother or sister into our family as well. I would highly recommend this toy. I mean, what little girl doesn't love Dora 
Let me just say this: my 4 year old is a certifiable Dora nut. She loves her. You could give her a bag with Dora on it and she'd think it was the cat's meow. But, I must say, Mom-Mom came through big with this toy for her 4th birthday. She loves that Dora feeds the twin babies from the bottle attached to her hand. She loves the little song that Dora sings about being a Big Sister when she presses Dora's hand. She's already singing it around the house. The feeding accesories are cute and durable as well and the twin babies themselves are all too cute in and of themselves. Also, Since my four-year old daughter is a twin as well - she has a twin brother - I think she can really relate to this toy on that level as well. Great toy 
My children and I are very happy with big sister Dora. My 18 month old baby sleeps with Dora's baby brother and sister in her hands. My three children enjoy playing with the doll, they love putting the babies in Dora's carrier. I wish they also sold the babies separately 
I got my stunning Baby Born off Ebay today. She is a different kind of Baby Born, but if I reviewed the exact doll she was then no one would read my review. She is absolutely adorable and so cuddly. Her skin feels like a real baby's and she looks so much like a newborn it's unbelievable. Her toes are individual-perfect for playing This Little Piggy! Her hands are so lovely and baby-like. She is kissably cute and fun to hold. And she can squeak! I love to make her squeak. Even my cousin (who is not that fond of baby dolls) likes her! I've gotten so many compliments on my baby. I love her so much. She is even heavy like a real baby! I love giving her a pacifier. She is so cute I don't want to put her down! What a fantastic toy! I totally recommend this for any doll lovers. She is cute, sized and weighted like a real baby, and soooo realistic. Not for younger kids, though. Definitely more 7-14 year olds. My 13 bucks was well spent on my new baby! If you want this baby then go for it!! I am going to get lots of new accessories for her off Ebay!!! If you are planning to get her, you should get some accessories to go with her and you should look on Ebay. This doll is sooooo worth the money! Outstanding!!! 
Unlike all the bad reviews on this doll, I want to say how wonderful this doll is she does everything it says on the box, I know a lot of people says she doesn't cry but she does it takes a while if your child plays with her a lot and feeds her the right way she will cry, our doll cry's every time my daughter squeezes her hand, even my 8 year old son loves to make her cry, it is over all a great doll my daughter dresses her in different outfits and take her everywhere she goes... 
My daughter got this doll 2 years ago and it is still her favorite! She still plays with it, swims with it and bathes with it. It is a great doll 
I am now in college- studding to be a teacher. I however got the orriginal "Baby Born" doll when I was one. It was my first doll ever and I still have her. I named her Molly when I was three and would carry her every where. I of course had the orriginal that didnt do as much as todays baby born- mine did not cry, make noises, go potty but I had an imagination and in my eyes she was real. (I watched "A little princess" and believed that all dolls were alive) But Baby born to me was more than a doll. I recamend baby born for all little girls- and the women who said baby born is ugly- well I dont know about other adults but the adults that my parents knew thought my doll was a real baby- until they would see me spin with her and they would have a heart attact and then realize its a doll...that they all thought was life like and adorable. I love baby born and I am now going to buy one for my cousin Jordan as her first real baby doll. 
This is the best kitchen out there. My kids have had it for about a year now. (4 and 2, a girl and a boy) And they LOVE it. They play with it everyday. We have TONS of kitchen accesories and they all fit. The freezer is one open space, the fridge has one shelf, the stove has one shelf and the pantry has one shelf. So this doubles as your storage too. My husband put it together, no problems. And i must add...the box came very damaged (it's very heavy and i guess the ups guy wasn't happy about that). It ended up that 4 major pieces were badly damaged. I called kidkraft and they sent brand new pieces (the big sides) no questions asked!!! so to top off a great product is a great company. 
My daughter LOVES this kitchen, however, it takes some time to put together and there are so many pieces! Definitely a 2 person project 
It is a beautiful kitchen - my 3yo loves it - I bought a lot of food and stuff to go with it and she gets a total kick out of it. The microwave plastic came cracked and it was so involved putting it together that we didn't bother un assembling it and sending it back 
I purchased this kitchen last Christmas for my girls. When it arrived, both my husband and I were amazed at the quality. Assembly instructions(although it takes a few hours) were very clear and all of the parts and pieces were color coded and numbered. I consider this piece to be "furniture quality." To top it off, it is absolutely adorable and my girls (2 and 4) love to play with it. It is definitely the type of piece that can be passed down from generation to generation. If you are considering purchasing some of the kitchen sets from the pricier mall/catalog stores (you KNOW which ones I am talking about), consider this first. 
My girls love this kitchen. They play with it everyday. It has a lot of storage so you can store play food, dishes, etc 
We bought this for my daughter's 3 year birthday and it was a huge hit. It is very solid, a nice size (almost 4 ft high by almost 4 feet long), big enough for 2 children to play with simaltaneously, and most of all NOT PLASTIC. My husband and I were amazed at the quality for the price and I think my daughter will get several years worth of play out of it it. I highly recommend it (keep in mind it took my husband 2-3 hours to assemble)! 
We bought this for our girls (4 and 2 yrs) last Christmas so we have last year's model so I can vouch for how well this has held up. They still love it and play with it daily. Great wooden design and sturdy construction, but let me tell you this is no small undertaking to assemble; it is easy but time consuming. If I only could have paid Santa to assemble! Other than that, as compared to the other wooden kitchens, it is a great product at this price point and much better quality than the plastic ones that make noises etc. as it is larger and in reality kids will use their imagination and don't need all that other stuff. My girls cook, bang, open doors and shove stuff in it and it takes it like a champ! The only drawback is that is is primarily made in feminine colors so if you have a little man that loves to cook Target now carries a great little wooden kitchen that is blue and has a stainless steel look to it plus they carry great wooden food and accessories. 
I bought the type with the fridge attached. My daughter loves it. I researched kitchen sets well, and this by far was the most reccommended! Love it Love it Love it! 
I bought the model with the refrigerator and phone for my granddaughter and it is so precious! I was expecting something screwed together and flimsy but KidKraft uses metal screw plugs (I can't remember what they are really called) to put this together and it is very sturdy and the screws won't strip out the pressed wood. (It does weigh 80#s!) The hardware that is used to put this together is all organized in a little tray so it was very easy for me to find what I needed, normally you have to spend the first hour sorting out the screws. The directions are pretty easy to follow, I only had problems figuring out how to attach the top but it only took me a few minutes to get it right. I am a woman who has my own tools so I tackled this project by myself and it took me a couple of hours, if I had had help it probably would have been completed much more quickly. (I do recommend tearing off the page with the tray items to keep handy so you aren't constantly flipping back to that page since you need the tray items on every step.) My granddaughter's eyes lit up when she saw it and she played in there for hours (she will be three in January and loves to play pretend). This is such a cute addition to her girly room and I simply love the pastel colors. I love the quality and the design. Perfect 
I just purchased this game for my 3-1/2 year daughter. She is a Dora fan, so she wanted to play it immediately. She sat there and played the entire game in one sitting. Basically, Dora and Boots are on an adventure to help find pieces for Tico's aircraft. Swiper makes his regular appearances as well. I had to help her understand how to do something in a couple of places, but otherwise it was right at her level. She knows her numbers and colors and she was very excited that she was able to progress. The best part about the game, in my opinion, is that your little one will be able to make jumps without any problem. The Pooh game is her other favorite (and another great game), but she needs help in making some of the jumps. In the Dora game, Dora won't fall if you keep walking when you are supposed to jump - she just leans over on his tippie toes like she is going to fall. My daughter was especially proud of the fact that she was able to jump on the swinging vines. I highly recommend this game! 
I bought this for my 5yo daughter. It's actually one of the better Dora games I've seen. Runs very similarly to the television show. Offers a little bit more Spanish than the show does. It's probably a tad on the 'easy' side for its age group though as my daughter didn't find it particularly difficult, but that didn't phase her interest any. It's now become one of her favorites V Smile games 
My son neo (4 1/2) got this game yesterday we opened it and he played all the way throught the learning adventure with out stopping. The controls for this game seem alittle more responsive than the older games. Dora speaks in both english and spanish: colors, numbers, and animals. If you are going to get another smartridge this is the one to get 
I have been waiting for this game to come out for my daughter as a reward for potty training. My daughter just turned 3 and this game was very easy for her navigate, as the previous poster stated some of other V-Smile games are hard to control. The graphics and characters voices are as if your watching the Cartoon Dora. This game is also very educational with teaching spanish and english colors and numbers. Also they teach animal sounds and recognition of animals (both underwater and farm animals). Today was the first day we had it so I'm sure I'm missing a lot in this review, but this game is by far the best V-Smile game of them all and we have all the V-Smile games (we keep up to date when the new games come out). 
This is a great game for the little ones just starting out with v-smile. Dora is very easy to control. Unlike the Lion King game where it's quite hard to jump from object to object, in this game you cannot miss your target. My daughter loves this game 
i needed a kitchen for my 3 yr old daughter that would fit into a very small space...but one that was enjoyable to play with. we received it very quickly, in time for her birthday, and although she has not played with it yet; i did a test run on it and it seems to be made very well; especially for the price. it is small but has many different little areas that she can work on that either slide out or open up. It would probably be difficult for more than two children, max, to really play with this at the same time (again b/c of the size) unless they had some other accompanying toys like table and chairs so that one child could be the chef and the others could help preapre the food at the table or be the customers, taking turns, etc... as for the tipping over part that another reviewer mentioned, hers will be against a wall; as i think most people have their toy kitchens so i dont think that would be a problem. in all; a good basic kitchen for a great price 
I purchased this kitchen because of its colors and the challenge it provides to my three year old son with a disability. He need to be able to go against gravity and this toy has helped him a whole lot. For my son it is for therapy, for my daughter is is a toy. I wish it was sturdy, but for me, it served the purpose 
We bought this kitchen for my 3 yr old son for christmas. After searching through other kitchens we decided on this one for many reasons. First we liked that it was not huge and overbearing, and with the minimal sounds and electronic functions there is still plenty of room for using his imagination which was important to us. Both burners light up, one makes a "frying" sound, the other a "boiling" sound. It is compact enough to move around easily, we like to keep it in the kitchen as well as the living room and outside on the nice days. Secondly we liked that chicco got it right with regards to the usually discriminating gender biased kitchen sets of pinks and purples. subdued primary colors are used in the chicco kitchen making it appealing to both genders. Lastly the price for this kitchen was a bargain compared to others out there, especially since we were not sure how much my son would really use it. Although my son has played with it in the company of another child with ease, I would reccomend getting something bigger if you have two children constantly playing with the kitchen as it is rather small or in conjunction with other kitchen items that can be placed near it like a microwave or coffee pot, so the focus is not just on one item at at given time 
My 3 year old and my 1 year old play so nicely together with this toy. My only complaint is that it could be heavier on the bottom; it's toppled over a couple of times. Otherwise, it's great; they love the 'burners' which make noise light up. I bought some more accessories because there's not too many included 
My son has always tried to "cook" with the real pots and pans and always asked for a spoon to stir his food with so in order to keep our real stuff clean, I decided to get him his own kitchen for Christmas this year. When he woke up Chrismtas morning, he went straight for this toy and played with it for an hour before even looking at the other toys and presents. And it only took maybe 5 minutes to assemble--quite a bonus for Christmas Eve. The reasons I chose this one was because it is in primary colors so it's OK for boys and girls, it doesn't take up much space and it was reasonably priced. As others mentioned it is easy to tip over since it's small especially for younger kids (like my son) who really want to reach the top storage area but are a bit too short. I've started to make sure it's against the wall or refrigerator so it can't get knocked over. With reference to another reviewer mentioning the oven door not staying closed, you do have to push it hard to close it all the way but then it does stay closed. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase since my son is totaly in love with it and it is compact enough that we can keep it in the kitchen all the time without it getting in the way 
My one year old son loves to play with toy kitchens whenever he sees one, but I did not want to pay big $$ for a toy kitchen. I am so glad that I found this one. He is 13 months old and it is perfect for him. Very inexpensive but VERY cute and fun. He is not yet walking, so I just put it up against the wall. So far, it has not tipped over once. It is the perfect kitchen for him. He already pretends to cook and eat the play food that is included. My husband also liked the fact that it is not girlie in any way 
After surveying lots of kitchen sets, I decided to buy star kitchen for my kids(1.5 1.2 years old). It turned out to be a great choice. My kids love it, and I love it, too. 
This kitchen has everything the larger play kitchens have, but it takes up a third of the space. My daughter received this one for her second birthday and she enjoys cooking daddy breakfast with it almost every morning. When her friends come over to play, it is usually the first thing they go to -- even the older ones! I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to buy their child(ren) a small, but very functional kitchen 
I ordered this particular bunco set because the company's description said it was PINK! I received a very ugly cream and red set. 
The set is great and the rule book refreshed my memory. The Item did not come in the color shown. I wanted a pink one and I got a red and taupe set. Kind of disappointing 
The game of Bunco has been around since the late 1800's, when it was a popular parlor game among Victorian families. At some point, it spread through the mining and gambling communities in the still-wild West and became a popular way to lose lots of money quickly. The game of Bunco has remained popular among many people for all this time, and Fundex Games has now released a Bunco Party kit. The game comes with all the things you need to play Bunco, as well as cute invitations to invite people to your very own Bunco Party! Bunco is a great game for an afternoon with the girls, a family game night or an alternative to poker (or your other gambling game of choice). 
As the previous reviewer complained about this games simplicity, he has obviously never attended a BUNCO Party! This is a awesome game to play with a group of friends, it is easy, allows for conversation, and has become a craze across the USA!!! There are countless Bunco party's going on each week which allow moms and I am sure some dads a night out with friends neighbors for a little fun. This kit is great and has everything you'll need to host a BUNCO party! Get the wine chilling the appetizers ready for a fun party you and your friends will never forget!!! 
I played this game a bunch of times today. The game was pointless, slow, and boring. The only thing I liked was ringing the bell. The point of the game is to roll 21 ones, then twos, then threes, etc. How lame is that. I recommend you try Yatzee instead 
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. SHE LOVED IT IN THE STORE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE. I ALSO AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STICKERS, BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A GENIOUS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY GO. I CHOSE TO NOT SHAROEN THE PENCIL BECAUSE SHE IS 3 AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY. FOR TWENTY DOLLARS IT IS A GOOD BUY. I KNOW MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND IS HAVING A LOT OF FUN WITH IT 
I bought this for our daughter and decided to open it, apply the stickers, and put the tools in a little travel bag before wrapping it up for Christmas. I'm very glad I did, because I'll have time to return it now and get her something else! 1. The end-door (yellow) will not stay closed. It falls out, it falls in. 2. The syringe looks cute until you pick it up. Because it gets wider at the back, the plunger will not stay in it - it just drops right out. Also, the hole which would normally be at the tip is placed on the side. ?! 3. The tools really do need a bag. If that were the only problem, I had the solution by using a small travel bag. 4. There is nothing to tell where the stickers go. I looked at the wrap-around packaging to figure it out, but had two stickers left over. I examined all of the toys themselves for clues, but ended up throwing the extra stickers away. 5. There is a little clipboard and an unsharpened pencil. The pencil does not stay in the clipboard's pencil "holder." Do NOT buy this set! Buy a stuffed animal and a regular play-doctor kit. You could even buy a real (small) pet cage at a pet store! 
Brought this item for my grandaughter, and she has totaly enjoyed it. It appears to be well made, and should last a long time. I believe it to be very educational as she pretends to be a veternarian 
Overall this is a nice toy. My daughter loves animals and if your child does this would be one they would enjoy playing with over and over again. It comes with everything you need to care for the puppy. The puppy is soft and very huggable. The only thing I would suggest is that it should come with a small bag to keep all the pieces in. My daughter ends up throwing all the pieces into the carrier with the dog in it and they jiggle and spill out sometimes when it's being carried around. It would also help to avoid losing those small pieces. Other than that, we love it 
My seven year old daughter says she wants to be a vet, so when we went to spend some birthday money, and she saw this, she fell in love with it. Some of the accessories don't look like any tool I've ever seen at a vet's office, but that hasn't stopped her from finding a use for them--she's really using her imagination with this one. No broken parts in our kit, and it's not getting the most gentle treatment, so maybe I got a new version or something. We also got the 13" (I think) Darby that comes separately, and she says it's the Mommy dog, and "Little Darby" is her baby, who's sick and has to see the vet 
We got this for my daughter for her 2nd birthday. She plays with it daily and love to pretend she's the doctor for Darby. She puts him to bed in his kennel everynight just like we do our real dog. Would highly recommend this toy 
Very interesting spoof of the original game. I found the first one boring after a few plays, but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays. It's a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth it 
After I saw the advertisement for Clue DVD I immediately went out to buy it. I've always been a fan of Clue and this updated version provides players with some new twists and excellent graphics. While you are playing the game, the Butler and an Inspector often appear to provide you with Clues about the case. Another addition to the game is added locations and having to figure the time of the crime. Any Clue fan will appreciate this version 
I always thought Clue looked like a complicated game I'd never touch! That is until I played it at my friends house! Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions! This game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time! I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older 
Excellent product! I really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve. After playing all 50, you can just start all over again! Fun, fun, fun game! THANKS 
This is an extremely fun and addictive game. You shuffle the cards, and place three (room, weapon, person) in the secret envelope. In every room you go into, you can make accusations. If someone has the card you accused (like the room), then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad. The game changes constantly, so it never gets boring. The character pieces have teeny details, like Mr. Green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. I gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really THINK. Oh, and good problem-solving skills too. And coordination (you have to add all the clues up to see who did it). All in all, a terrific game. Great for rainy days or playdates. And did I mention the weapons? Very realistic. And cute 
This was a little difficult to figure out in the beginning - Actually had to read the instructions - but it was very fun and very disney. Fam loves it 
My son received this game for Christmas and it is by far his favorite game. He enjoys pretending to be a detective and the game is easy enough for him to play and understand. I just have to figure out how to get more of the scoring sheets 
I bought this game long time ago but unfortunately all my friends were busy until X'mas. There were 5 of us and once we started playing, we were all addicted! I have heard from some other friends commented Clue was a boring game, but we all found it fun and challenging! Apart from strict logic thinking, the keys to win were to ask the right question and make a good, well organised notes! Last time we played we had 5 players, so some of us got 4 cards in hand and some got only 3 in hands. That was a bit unfair because the players with 4 cards had more clues in the beginning and so their chances of winning were higher. So we tried in one game to open 3 cards on the table, the game was finished a lot more quickly. But we all found that it was less challenging. Overall, great game!! Train you brain in logic thinking as much as Sudoku and Mastermind 
Okay, the original B-Wing was a little under-scaled and wasn't very accurate to the movie. Lego has gained alot of popularity over the years, alot more than before. Alot of people were asking for a new B-Wing because: 1.They weren't fans at that time to get it. 2.The B-Wing is just so cool. Here's my review: The B-Wing, well, just looks so NICE! I don't know why it is called a B-Wing, since it resembles a T more than anything else. Oh well, still a cool ship. You get two minifigures, a B-Wing pilot dressed in a nice looking red. And you get a Sullustan pilot named Ten Numb.(Yes Ten Numb is a real Star Wars character, he was dressed red in Return of the Jedi.) I think Ten Numb looks great. If you see his actual picture, I think you would agree. The B-Wing pilot has a classic smily face and what looks to be a racing helmet. Shweet! Two pilots and you only need one. The B-Wing is a masterpiece. Not only does it look more accurate than it's previous self, it is more accurate. The B-Wing itself is very sturdy. Two cons come with the B-Wing though. One of them is that the missiles shown do not fire properly. You must tilt the B-Wing to do so, which is very annoying. Another is those dreaded stickers. You never really can get them on right. Oh well, I don't even put the stickers on anyway. The B-Wing comes with a nice yellow and black service station with tools so you can display the B-Wing. I don't use it because in reality, the B-Wing lands horizontally.But it is still nice to have and can be used with other sets if you like. All in all, this B-Wing literally destroys the old. You get two pilots when you only need one. The price isn't that bad considering the pieces. I think that every fan should own at least one of these. I'm still trying to figure out the B shape though.. 
I have always loved B-Wings and have told myself that one day I would get one. These new releases caught my eye and so I spent my own money to get one. I was not disappointed. The B-Wing is AWESOME!!! It copies the design and features from the fighter in the movie very carefully, so it's a good-looking model Actually, the B-Wing in the movie is pretty ugly, and this copies the ship from the movie, but I've played enough video games to respect its firepower. I guess it doesn't look too bad. It's a nice Lego, but nothing is perfect. Here are the pros and cons. PROS: At a good 15 inches tall, this thing is MONSTER! It looks really neat The service tower is a nice thing to have for realistic play With the tower as a display stand, this thing looks cool in your bedroom For a huge fighter, it's actually easy to play with This thing would probably rock in the Star Wars ship battles kids like me have with its 7 guns. Not too hard to build CONS: Kind of expensive It doesn't break often, but when it does, it's tough to repair It's not too hard to build, but it does take a while It doesn't balance too well on the service tower/display stand because it's so heavy. Don't touch it though and you'll be fine The Ten Numb minifigure doesn't look too good in my opinion You have to open the S-foils manually. You think Lego would have the little gear-wheel to open it. Missiles have zip range, but Lego never really came through in the missile department anyway Engines look a bit tiny compared to the rest of the model The mechanic minifigure(whichever one you choose to use, I like to use the Ten Numb minifigure)doesn't have a lot of room to stand on The pilot minifigure is kind of hard to fit in Overall, most of the flaws are tiny and it's a really cool ship worth the $35 
This game is GREAT! You can really create your dream life with this fun toy. What you do is you first create your girl - pick her face, hair style, hair color, and first pair of clothes-, create her room, and make friends. You can also do chores for money, get a job if you want, and go SHOPPING!! There is school but it's only for a few seconds. If you do your homework and study and get good grades, your parents will allow you to get cool things such as YOUR OWN PHONE! You can go to school dances, have crushes, and create your own best friend! It is really fun and ADDICTING!!!!!!! Once you start, it is almost impossible to put it down. Like I said, this game is really fun and enjoyable. P.S. I read some reviews and saw that a lot of people are complaining about stuff like that the parents are giving too much money for chores and that the dances are dumb because you spend money for a dress and everyone just wears normal clothes. Well if you think about it, the game is called DREAM Life, meaning it's the life you dream about. Wouldn't you want your parents to give you a lot of money to do easy chores, or to have the nicest dress at the dance? So, you can't really deduct stars for that. hope i helpe 
I bought this game for my 11.5 year old daughter and she was not thrilled with it. She played it once or twice and was bored with it. It is not a good game if you want a toy your child will love 
As a child, I myself grew up with Candyland. Now that I have children of my own, my house wouldn't be the same without it. We got this game when my son was 3 and my daughter was 2. Both of the kids understand the concept of the game and enjoy playing it. The best thing about this game is that there's nothing really complicated. The kids don't even have to know their colors to play. They just need to match up the color on the card with the color on the board. The game is simple enough that the kids often win which makes the game more enjoyable for them 
Every child should have a chance to play this game at least once in their lifetime. The characters on the game board are so awesome too. Queen Frosting (that was her name... right?) is so pretty, she was always my favorite character. All in all, it's a great game and a great gift for nearly any child 
im 17, and this has been my favourite game since i was a baby. its so much fun, and it's soo simple, even the smallest of children can play. plus, now there are so many different versions of this game, that there are endless hours of fun and excitement! this game is a staple to every boy and girl, and is the perfect "first boardgame" to start the collection &lt;3&lt; 
My kids really enjoy playing the Candy Land DVD game. There are 3 different games to play and you can play for fun or play to win on each game. With kids running and bouncing around, I really like the fact that the mats pretty much stay put on the carpet. Unlike other games, the kids are not slipping and sliding or falling down on the mats. I believe this game is rated for ages 4 and up, but I think that most 2 and 3 year old kids could play most of the games if not all of the games. My son is 2 and he can play all of the games (we have to help him a bit of the 'Mister Mint says' game though) 
Fabulous kitchen which I purchased for my 2 year old grandaughter. I first saw it at a home recently sold by me. I was impressed by the quality and appearance. Upon speaking to other parents and discovering that their children used this "toy" at least until 9, I was inclined to spend the money. Needless to say, my grandaughter is thrilled. I have the kitchen in my home office and both her mother and I can feel free to use the computer while she is playing next to us 
I purchased this kitchen three weeks ago for my grandchildren. The instructions were great for assembly. Lots of storage space for all the kitchen food,dishes and small appliances. I have it set up in my kitchen and it fits in well with my decor. It has all the "bells whistles", that my 4 year old granddaughter and 18 month old grandson really seem to be enjoying. It takes up a good size spot in my kitchen but it's totally worth it to see the children having fun with it 
I gave this toy to my children for Christmas this year and they absolutely love it! They can entertain themselves for hours with this toy and I cannot say that about any other toy they own. It takes two people to put it together but it is pretty easy. My husband and I got it put together in about an hour. I recomend this kitchnen to anyone, it is well worth the money spent. They will get years of fun out of it 
I bought the deluxe version of this kitchen so there would be plenty of room for my 2 and 3.5 year old to use it at the same time. It is big but it's worth it! It was a Christmas present and they play with it daily. There's plenty of storage within the kitchen for play food and pots/pans and dishes although we use a back up box for the overflow. It comes in two big boxes but assembly was fairly straight forward. It took me 1.5 hours with a power screwdriver (I cannot imagine putting this together without one). A few minor issues: The description calls for 14 AA batteries. It actually used 12 AA batteries and the phone used 2 AAA batteries. Shipping is very expensive. I wish I had done more homework and either gotten a lower price or free shipping. A few of the screws were difficult to get in place because there was not enough room to use the power screwdriver (or any screwdriver) straight on. The screws for the battery plate on the phone are very small and one got stripped when trying to take the back plate off to insert batteries. I have not had any of the problems other reviewers have mentioned regarding doors not closing properly. Everything fits tightly and is aligned well. Overall I love the style of the kitchen. It's not garish like most play kitchens. Everyone get's a kick out of all the appliances and the working light over the sink. This is a toy that's full of details that are probably over my kids' heads at this time but will be appreciated more as they get older. Well worth the money and floor space! But forget having a quiet moment to read the newspaper. My kids find that the best time to cook something for me 
I have been eyeing this kitchen for two Christmas'. We knew this year we were definitely going to purchase a kitchen set for our 4 y/o, 2 y/o, and 10 month old. It was just a matter of finding one that was durable, had fun stuff, and options that were fun for all three kids. We wanted something that was big enough for two kids to play at, and something that would grow with our family. This kitchen has definitely met all my expectations. We purchased this directly from the manufacturer as they were offering free shipping until the end of last year. I took the advice of other reviewers and made sure to put the stickers on first. The Step 2 website has a great video demonstration for putting this together. An electric screwdriver is nice, but there are some tricky angles that might require a regular one. I would definitely expect to spend at least an hour putting it together. But just think, you only have to put it together once. I did it alone, but it would have been helpful to have an extra set of hands. The kids love this kitchen. Our 10 mo. old isn't old enough to truly understand cooking, but she loves to open and close the cabinets and oven, pull the drawers out, and put things in and out of the sink. Our 2 y/o has more of an imagination and enjoy actually pretend cooking. He understands it and loves all the space available. Our 4 y/o isn't really a "cooker", but he plays with this too. I like all the storage space this kitchen provides. The doors on the cabinets aren't all that sturdy, but they get the job done. They definitely aren't the quality of the countertops or main structure. There are sounds on the microwave, dishwasher, oven, phone, and stove. That said, the first three mentioned are basically the same "sound maker", just with different sounds coming out. The stove is neat, especially with the clear pots. I'm sure there are many other kitchens out there that have more of a "wow" factor as far as "lights and sounds". I am definitely pleased with this kitchen, and it was worth the wait. It does take up some space, but nothing I didn't measure out before we decided to purchase it. 
We bought this for our son who will turn 2 this month. He loves to cook and was always in my pans. He now has his own kithchen and loves all the sounds and different compartments. He is a very active boy and loves to climb and try to tear things up. I love step 2 because it is very durable and this kithchen is a great addition to our toys. Plus I love the neutral colors considering this was for a boy!! Highly recommend and was not that difficult to put together. Just do the stickers first and have 14 batteries ready!! 
We bought this kitchen set for our daughter for x-mas because we are stationed overseas we went through hell and back to get it at first we ordered it from Sears.com well they cancelled our order 2 days before x-mas I was heart broken cause I had bought all the accessories for the kicthen set and was looking foward to getting it for our daughter but then I looked online at Step2direct they have the kicthen for 199.00 and the are even offering free shipping it will take sometime to get here but I can't wait to see my child's reaction I know she will love it as much as I d 
This is a great kitchen!! Bought it for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas. Not really any problems putting it together. Cordless screwdriver makes putting it together much easier. [... 
This kitchen is fabulous!! I bought this for my daughters. We used this kitchen as a replacement for the SSC kitchen we had. I ordered this direct from Step2. It was 199.99 and free shipping. It was delivered very fast since their factory is very close to me. I have 7, 4 and 2 yr old girls. This was a HUGE hit with my 2 yr old. My 7 yr old is more into her gameboy and my 4 yr old loves the kitchen as well. This was very easy to assemble. The lables were very easy to apply. The acc. that come with this are very high quality. I am thinking of ordering more acc. from Step2. Dont waist your time looking at other kitchens. Spend the extra money and order this one. Step2 has the smaller lifestyle kithcen. It is just a step down from this one, but looks much smaller. I saw it at TRU. Once I saw that one I had made my decision to order the Deluxe kitchen. The other one didn't have the free ship anyway. Overall this kitchen is very high quality and the best on the market in my opinion. 
I read some of the other reviews about htis item and was nervous about getting it put together. Despite what I read, it was very simple. I did it all by myself and it was ready to play with in just 2 hours (That's counting putting on all of the decals). If you just set up your "work area" before you get started, it's simple. The decals weren't hard to get on with it being set up. I think this is a great toy to have. My daughter is 4 nd a half and she absolutely loves it. I would recomend this toy to everyone with kids. I am very pleased with my purchase and know this toy is well worth the $199 I spent. I ordered it directly from Step 2 and they had it delivered to me on Christmas Eve.....just in the nick of time!! 
My kids are used to playing games on a computer so the screen was very disappointing. It is very poor quality, but perhaps that is why it is so inexpensive. I wish I had taken the advice of some other viewers and gone to a store to see it in person. I will be trying to sell mine again 
I am expecting to give a 5 star review. I have not used this product yet. I just purchased it for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She has been telling me that she wants the Easter Bunny to bring her a computer. Mommy works on a laptop all day and she is so interested in using my keyboard. I thought this looked like a real laptop and it should interest her as much as mine does. I have originally thought that this would be too advanced for her (ages 5 and up listed on my box), but after reading a few of the reviews it might just be the right challege that she needs. Mom in Michiga 
I bought this for my grandson's 6th birthday along with the case. He started using it immediately and thinks it is just like Mom's and Grandma's laptops--mouse and all! But this is kid-sturdy and educational. He loves it. 
I purchased this activity notebook for my granddaughter who has scheduled a thirty minute session each night after dinner. It was her request, by the way. I like the fact that it tracks progress and has levels of difficulty that will keep her attention for years to come. As a bonus, her little brother can use it as well when he is old enough. I predict its usefulness in their household for at least the next twelve years. Its the best gift I've ever purchased for a child 
I bought this as a gift for my grandson. He was so excited when he opened it. And, after we got it going, I was really surprised at how much it did. We're really pleased with this product. 
I just bought a Nitro Notebook for my 5 year old son, and it's been a great success. He has really improved his reading,writing, and number skills in just three weeks. I will certainly buy the next level laptop for him when the time comes. Father, Dom.Rep 
We bought the game thinking it would be just like the real life game, but with sponge Bob characters. It is a very simplified version of the game. It is geared towards young children. In the game, if you run out of money, you just keep playing, and you are exempt from having to pay any fees, while the people with money, still keep paying...so you are actually better off if you lose your money early in the game. (that bugs me) as far as the spinner goes...it snaps on, you have to press hard to get it to click into place, and it works great. Just a little disappointed, just remember, it's for little kids. If you love the game of life, get the original one...my older kids want me to buy the original one, they don't care for the sponge bob version. 
I don't think the original edition of the Game of Life was meant for grade-school age children. Re-vamping the board with familiar Sponge Bob, Squidward, Mr. Crabs and Patrick makes it an inviting game! Visually, the game board looks great. There are slots on the board to insert the Crusty Crab, The Chum Bucket, Sponge Bob's house, etc. The game is a lot of fun and my kids enjoyed it so much. I even enjoyed playing it with them. My only complaint is with the spinner. It is a great looking two-part spinner but when you spin it you have to hold it down. Otherwise it will come apart and/ or come off the board. 
I got this for my almost 5 and 6 yr olds who are big-time Spongebob fans. This game is absolutely adorable and loads of fun for our whole family! The board is an outrageously colorful and fun representation of Bikini Bottom. There are 3-D buildings of Patrick's, Squidward's, Spongebob's houses, The Krusty Crab, The Chum Bucket, Mrs. Puff's Boating School, The Anchor, The Shady Shoals Rest Home. The pawns are delightful and substantial 3-D plastic renditions of Spongebob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs that ALWAYS stay standing on their adequate base!! I can't stand those cheapo cardboard pawns with the tiny stands!!! There is no accumulation of children in this game version, but one does decide on whether to attend college or not (and pick a corresponding career), adopt a pet, and chose a home. There are life tiles($100 each)to earn for doing decent things and expenses to pay for unfortunate or typical Bikini Bottom life events. There are also Raffle cards to help earn extra money by game of chance spins. The writing on all of the cards is witty and humorous. I won't spill the beans about the pets, careers, homes, expenses, life cards or raffle cards because they are just so cute and funny!! My kids think the cards are a riot! The winner is determined once every player has reached Shady Shoals rest home by greatest net worth. The game moves along at just the right pace and my kids had no problem learning the rules. It is a great teacher of reading and money counting ($1,000's $100's only)as well as decision making and consequences of behavior. Game play really does even out any skill level because much of the game is chance based by the numerical spinner to make your move. I paid full price for this game and I think it is well worth every penny! A++++++, FABULOUS GAME!!!!!! 
My daughter loved it for her birthday. It is really cute 
[...] My sister and I thought we would be able to Instant message using these across the neighborhood. So we split up, loading the "chips". To our displeasure, we had to walk all the way back, switch "chips" and put them in. This is not a very good toy. First, you have to annoyingly scroll through each letter. For example, to type in a y, you have to press the select button 25 times and enter it, so messages take AT LEAST 5 minutes. Then you have to physically HAND these little chips to your friends. It would be 100x easier just to talk to them. There are a ton of little gadgets like these, but this has to be one of the worst. You are better off just talking or buying another toy of this nature, as nobody wants to walk, switch "chips" and walk away. 
My daughter got this as a gift for her 2nd birthday. Not only does she love putting the puzzles together - and double the fun being two-sided - her 4 yr old sister also enjoys it. It is useful to teach more complex concepts to our 4 yr old, such as 2 triangles make a square, 4 triangles make a rectangle. Both girls really enjoy this toy, as with all Melissa and Doug toys, it is very well made and will withstand abuse. Just wish it was easier to fit the plastic cover on, we can't seem to fit the shapes neatly to close easily, especially in a hurry. A minute inconvenience. A great toy 
We loved this set. It is great for very young kids and they like it. However, the time between learning the principle and getting bored because it became too easy, was very short. About 2 months ago we bought Snappers by Toysie - a pattern block puzzle. My children (with 3 years apart!) both still play with it. It seems like my youngest child will be using it for the next 3 years. That is the lifespan for a toy 
We bought this for our son as a Christmas present. As he was not quite two yet, I thought he might not totally get the concept and that this would be a toy I could put up for later. Boy was I wrong. He loves this puzzle set. I find he plays with it longer and gets less frustrated if I first let him pick out which picture he wants to "build" and then take the necessary shapes out and place them next to him. He is very proud of himself once he gets the pieces in then he'll give himself a big round of applause(which mommy and daddy do also). Great self-esteem builder and fun way to teach shapes 
Our two children (12 months and 23 months) just love this set. The boards and pieces are very sturdy. We like that the boards are two sided. Good variety and amount of shapes. This is a classic toy that will last for years- we see it as one that we will keep even after our children have grown out of it- great to keep around for visiting kids 
This item is a must have! My two year old chooses it over just about anything else. I always seek out Melissa and Doug toys because of their quality and educational value and this one is one of mine and my daughter's favorites 
This is a brightly-colored, sturdy pattern block set. I would give this set to a child between 20 months and 3 years. My 22-month old just loves it. As soon as he saw it (hidden away, intended as a Christmas gift) he kept at me to open it. I finally gave in, and I am so glad that I did. He is at the perfect developmental level for this toy! He tries to match up the shapes and colors, and is even starting to name the shapes on his own. This is such an exciting age! I like how the solid wooden boards are double-sided and VERY sturdy. There are more than enough pieces to go around- even if a few are lost over the years. A few of the pictures arrived with some scratching, but I think this is more annoying for me than it is for my child. Don't forget that these patterning blocks can also be used independantly of the boards. This enables your child to come up with more challenging creations as she or he developes greater skill in this area 
My son is 21m and he absolutely loves this puzzle. Whenever he catches me putting it away, he immediately takes it apart and plays with it again. It's not challenging enough for my 3yo. She'll play with it for a few minutes and gets bored, but my son loves putting the shapes in over and over. A great toy for rainy days 
My soon to be 2 year old son is obsessed with shapes and had outgrown the basic shape puzzle (the large knob puzzle by melissa and doug) and I was looking for a puzzle that went beyond that but was not too difficult. I was thrilled to find this! It looks and feels great too. My son really enjoys it and I think it is conceptually very well put together. Not only are the puzzles well within his reach but he also enjoys free play with the shapes. He recently discovered that 2 triangles can make a square and two rectangles can make a square too :) That was only possible because the shapes are thoughtfully proportioned as such. I do agree with the other viewer who said that this puzzle is not for a 5 year old. My son is not yet 2 and he can do them. If it wasn't for the sharp edges of the shapes I would say its for 18+ months - 3 years 
Back in January of 2006, I purchased the "Rock-N-Fold" Chair for my son. He absolutely loves it! Not only does he play his video games in it, he also does his homework in it as well! This product is the best ever 
My sons love the rock fold chair. They use it when their friends come over and they play games for a long time. They watch TV and rock and love the chair. I love the fact that is folds and i can just store it in the closet and have room to play. Thank you this product is a great space saver and great for kids 
it really is a fun toy that helps you stay fit and will make you laugh 
Great concept, but bad design. Both of my children have had one for a year. Due to the discomfort, they never use it! It needs to recline back further and the plastic is slippery making it hard to sit without slipping around 
This was a great buy from Amazons sale rack at five dollars and 29 cents plus free shipping. My [...] just loves puzzles and we are certainly fond of Melissa and Doug products. We normally purchase them from Tuesday Morning or our local hobby store because they are usually cheaper. This puzzle has made my toddler happy. He fits it together then dumps it, repeating the process several times a day. The drawing is realistic and there are no pegs, so it gives a little more grown up feel to the piece. 
This is a wonderful wood puzzle for the toddler who finds the baby wood puzzles too easy but who doesn't quite have the dexterity (or patience) to fit together classic puzzle shaped pieces. Because it is all wood, it can stand up to the wear and tear of a toddler. My son (20 months) found this hard at first, but was thrilled to have the challenge and would not stop working on it for days until he could do it easily. The picture is underneath the pieces. The is one of my son's very favorite toys of all time! He also loves the school bus one that is similar by the same company 
A definite must for the firetruck lover in your family. This keeps my toddler busy for quite awhile and he even talks to it! Very, very cute and durable too - it takes quite a slamming and hasn't even chipped 
This puzzle is my son's favorite. A great gift for a boy who enjoys puzzles and fire trucks 
This puzzle is great, and I'm glad I bought it for my 2 year old, Claire. However, like most toddlers, she prefers things that are HER size. I find that the hands in this puzzle are slim adult sized hands, like my own. Maybe the makers felt "Mommy" sized hands were the way to go, or simply that they wanted to fill the space in a standard sized wooden puzzle. I think it would have been nice to make the hands toddler sized, with chubby palms and fingers. That said, it's a great tool. We don't use it much for counting, though that is it's intent. This is more of a prop for the song fest of "Where is Thumbkin" and an even more exciting prop for the game of "Dr. Claire" wherein she repairs the "owie hand". All in all, a fine addition to your wooden puzzle collection 
I thought that this would be toy my daughter would grow into and not be excited about at first. This was the first toy she opened at Christmas at only 19 months and was not interested in any others for the rest of the week! She enjoyed collecting the fingers and and "counting" them. She also has grown in the last few months to putting the puzzle together herself although the fingers might not make it on the correct hand just yet. Very durable, love that it is a traditional wood toy that doesn't have flashing lights or needs batteries! She still loves it months later. The only downside to any toy like this, is we have to collect the pieces after she has put them in various places around the house. 
Our little girl absolutely loves puzzles, and this one presented a real challenge. The pieces are somewhat irregular, left from right, which allows for growth in her problem-solving abilities. I bought this when she was 22 months, and she has been able to master it quickly. Not only do the pegged pieces help define fine motor skills, but the numbers, colors, and left/right make this a multi-dimensional learning tool. She's 24 months now, and has most colors down as well as learning to count. The colors were really helpful, because being the neurotic parent, I was beginning to wonder if she had some colorblindness because she wasn't recognizing colors at first. But silly me, I forgot she was a toddler. So much for my fears of why she isn't solving quadratic equations. 
My kids love this puzzle. It's in my pediatrician's office, and they run to it every time. My son, now 4, has been interested in it since he was 2, and my 2 year old is now fascinated by it as well. 
Little hands do well with the two hands on this puzzle. The bright, colorful art and images have thrilled my children. It is well made and sturdy. My children think of this as a "big kids" puzzle since it isn't farm or baby animals. It makes them proud when they put it together 
Definitely a must buy!!!! My two year old learned her right hand from her left hand by using this puzzle. Not only does she understand the concept of counting from 1 to 10, but she also understands that each finger on each hand is different from the other. This puzzle teaches spacial concepts, counting, colors, and coordination. I wish there were more puzzles like this one. If anyone knows of any, please contact me through Amazon. chrische 
My little boy loves puzzles, and this is probably his favorite one. And I like that it's so sturdy and will be able to be passed down to his sister 
My little girl received this puzzle along with two other ones on her second birthday. I thought it would be a little too advanced for her but it turned out to be her favorite one! She showed me that with persistence little hands can achieve great things. She is two and half now and she still loves this puzzle, whether it is to count the objects on each finger or to learn the names of the fingers it keeps her busy each time she picks it up. 
This puzzle has been through two kids in my house and it's still in great shape. The cardboard is thick and durable. The picture is friendly and interesting. It's been a favorite with my kids. However, if you are buying this puzzle for a two-year old or younger, this puzzle can be very cumbersome to solve simply because the pieces are gigantic. As a small child solves the puzzle, he must basically crawl over it to reach the other parts and that causes the pieces to come apart. The floor puzzles like this one have caused some aggravation with my kids simply because they can't avoid getting on the puzzle to reach sections and that undoes their work. We have found smaller sized pieces to be easier to solve, as long as the fine motor skills allow. Just something to keep in mind.. 
Both of my boys love Thomas. I really scored when I found this Thomas puzzle. The puzzles is built to take the abuse of a 2 4 yr. The box that it comes in, is a bit of pain to get all the tabs undone to get to the puzzle. Cute box, but a pain. M.G 
My 3 year old likes this puzzle (she loves the Thomas character) and really enjoys doing this one. The color is bright and the picture is interesting. This one is a great starter for kids learning how to work with puzzles. I gave 4 out of 5 only because this one isnt as challenging as some other 24 piece puzzles... though that doesnt seem to deter my youngster, who puts it together daily 
My 2 1/2 yo received this puzzle for Christmas. He is a big Thomas fan, so the subject matter was perfect. The pieces are quite large - I'd estimate 4 inches by 4 inches, and are well-made. The graphics are colorful and accurate - the puzzle depicts Thomas, Percy, James, Cranky Harold. My son asks to put the puzzle together over and over. He can now do most of it by himself just by putting together one engine at a time. The fact that the pieces fit together easily and are large make it less frutrating for him. I'd highly recommend this puzzle for any Thomas fan 
This is such a cute puzzle and your Thomas the Train fan will love it. It comes in a Thomas the Train-shaped box and the pieces are large enough for a toddler to grab and fit together. My son is 2 1/2 and he loves this puzzle and can put most of it together by himself. I highly recommend it 
My 3 years old son like's it but put's it together in no time. Not so hard 
our son loves the puzzle, the only negative thing that we would like to add, is that when we opened the box, on of the pieces had a piece of glue stuck to it, and unfortunately separating the pieces torn the puzzle piece, which my son notices. he does not like to see (something broken - as he says), apart from that the puzzle has had a lot of use. 
This puzzle is a lot of fun and my son loves it. The container is a toy for itself 
My 28 month old son got this puzzle for Christmas and loves it. He put it together the first time out of the box himself. It is the first thing he does every morning and then several times a day. My almost 5 year old likes it too. It is not as sturdy as the Melissa Doug floor puzzles, but it still really sturdy. 
A lot of people look at this figure and say 'he has no wings!'.While this is true,I still recommend this toy,an excellant hair sculpt and goku's famous 'I have no idea what's going on, but be happy anyway!'look.The wings are actually really cool,although the halo has a job staying on.0verall this is a great toy and a definate purchase for any dbz fan or toy collector 
My Grandson has truly enjoyed the Easyscore Basketball Set from the first day he tried it. Wonderful to have the adjustment for heightening as he grows. 
My son is three yrs old and about 42 inches, we keep it on the next to last highest setting and it is enjoyable for him We will probably need to put it on the highest setting soon and probably need a bigger one next summer. He has alot of fun with it and although it is not very tall or does not have the ability to go as tall as some other models, he still has fun trying to aim and shoot for the hoop so we will use it to practice these skills before buying another. You definitely need to fill the base with sand before using( do not use water as substitue) as it will tip over repeatedly without sand as per the directions. Overall just like any basketball set this one provides great outdoor/indoor fun as well as exercise and is durable compared to others in its price point. We have not had problems with the height adjustment bar or with any parts falling off and my son is rough with this toy and b/c I did not fill with sand right away it has fallen numerous time and seems to be wearing well. So I think it is a great deal for the price 
This basketball goal is great, its a great height for little ones and provides hours of fun! The best thing is, its a classic toy that requires no batteries, and several kids can play at the same time 
My husband and I bought this for our son for his second birthday and he LOVES it. We set it up as soon as he unwrapped it and he played with it for an hour straight, stopping only because it was bed time. He even passed up cake so he could continue playing. The ball is the perfect size and the height adjustment will be very useful as his skills improve. He can easily play by himself, as most shots that go through the hoop are returned to him. Warning: temper tantrum might ensue when it is time to stop playing 
I got this for my son when he was about 18 months. He is now ten and we still have it indoors. It has provided all three of my boys and their friends with entertainment. Simple and durable. I'm getting one for my nephew who's 2 
I bought this Basketball hoop for my son who was two and LOVED to shoot hoops. Great height for a small kid, but difficult to adjust, latch always got stuck. Also, after a few months, the latch broke right off. Now I have a hoop that is too low for the basketball to be any fun for my son. Now it is just a $30 peice of trash 
I bought this hoop for my 14mth. old and he loves it!! He made a shot the first try and this hoop has kept him busy for a long time. I keep it in our basement for indoor play and it's sturdy and durable! I can't honestly say who enjoys playing "hoops" (as we call it at our house) more, him or me 
i got this toy for my nephew and i know he will get alot of good years out of it. 
I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because I want her introduced to all sports; whether she chooses to go with a specific one years from now it all up to her, but I am doing my part. I cannot speak highly enough about this basketball set. It's GREAT! Even adults can join in with kids in playing with this! I have read more than one review saying that the rim/hoop keeps falling out... my suggestion is MAKE SURE IT'S IN ALL THE WAY! You will hear a click letting you know it's securely in, not to mention you can tell by looking at the back of it. It should be flush against the backboard. I hope that those few reviews won't hinder another parent's choice in purchasing this wonderful and family friendly toy! I give it 5 stars all the way 
This is a VERY! cute set and all the littlest pet shop playsets are hot right now. But Toys r us has this EXACT same item for only $29.99 right now. If you want to buy this toy AND SAVE SOME MONEY, BUY THIS SET FROM TOYS R US. JUST SOME FRIENDLY ADVICE. And happy shopping everyone!!! 
I just did another review on the Diego treehouse set as my twins decided to purchase this and the Deigo set. I will first say we purchased this for much less at a well known local store (not sure if I can say where). It is well made and my girls played with it for hours. They have decided to ask Santa for other pieces to go with this set. I have a whole basket full of Littlest Pet Shop items for them also through Amazon where I found these items to be comparable in price. You will not be disappointed in this purchase 
I never could have imagined that LITTLEST PET SHOP would release another fabulous toy set after the LITTLE LOVIN' PET PLAYHOUSE - which I adore - but they have achieved absolute greatness with the release of the WHIRL AROUND PLAYGROUND. In this set - which requires a minimal amount of assembly - your pets are able to take a ride on the treetop swing set, ride down the slide, spin on the merry-go-round, relax in the comfortable hammock, eat at the cozy cafe, compete in an obstacle course, ride the elevator, sit in the sandbox, and get a view of the world from the observation deck. It is amazing how well each feature in this playset works, and how much fun it is to play with the set. Most animals fit in every area, and more than twenty pets can occupy the WHIRL AROUND PLAYGROUND at a time. This set includes a cute gray mouse, a prissy puppy - who comes with a pair of sunglasses that actually stay on - a food/water combo dish, a bed, and a slide, to make the most of your pets stay at the WHIRL AROUND PLAYGROUND. The best thing this playset offers, however, is the fact that no batteries are required. Things move by the touch of your hand, or by turning something clockwise. A must-have addition to your LITTLEST PET SHOP collection. Hours of fun, and no batteries needed! Erika Sorocco Freelance Reviewer Book Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape 
My daughter seems to really enjoy it and all the neighborhood girls that come over seem fascinated with it. no problems so far with materials or qualit 
It is quicker to play than the boardgame and much more compact.....so easy to bring on trips, etc. 
I have trouble believing this is for small children. I tried to play this at a party with some friends. All of us who tried to play are in our 20s and 30s, and we couldn't figure out how the game was supposed to work. The DVD never makes it clear whose turn it is or what's really happening, and there are too many things added to the game from the original. I've played the regular, classic version of Clue many times and enjoy it, but this new version is frustrating, complicated, and not fun at all. I can't imagine that children would actually have fun with this when four adults couldn't even figure out what was going on 
Very interesting spoof of the original game. I found the first one boring after a few plays, but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays. It's a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth it 
After I saw the advertisement for Clue DVD I immediately went out to buy it. I've always been a fan of Clue and this updated version provides players with some new twists and excellent graphics. While you are playing the game, the Butler and an Inspector often appear to provide you with Clues about the case. Another addition to the game is added locations and having to figure the time of the crime. Any Clue fan will appreciate this version 
Excellent product! I really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve. After playing all 50, you can just start all over again! Fun, fun, fun game! THANKS 
This was a little difficult to figure out in the beginning - Actually had to read the instructions - but it was very fun and very disney. Fam loves it 
My son received this game for Christmas and it is by far his favorite game. He enjoys pretending to be a detective and the game is easy enough for him to play and understand. I just have to figure out how to get more of the scoring sheets 
I purchased the creamy crayons for the grandkids, they really enjoyed drawing and coloring with them. Their mothers had tons of fun with them also. Something different from the markers and same old crayons. Maybe I'll get some for myself yet! 
If you are interested in this kitchen because you would like to expose your children to new languages, I would keep looking. My goal was to expose my daughter to French, but the quality of the voice is so poor that I can barely understand what is being said in English! The quality of the construction is fine but, frankly, you're paying for the added bonus of the languages and it simply isn't worth it. I would recommend looking for a regular kitchen, whose design you like, and finding another way to introduce language 
I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. I was so surprised at the quality for Little tykes. It has no storage and the refridgerator door would not stay closed. I think it should cost half of what it does. I purchased the Step Two kitchen when my daughter was three, and it is way better by far 
This kitchen is reasonably priced with lots of kitchen accessories. My 2 1/2 year old daughter has fun playing with it when she's in the mood to play kitchen. It has most of the "kitchen" things you'd think of: sink, dishes, pots, pans, oven, mixer, etc. The food has RFID chips built in so when you put them in the pan/pot on the stove, it speaks and says things like, "mmm, eggs... and... bacon, you're a great cook! (frying sound)". This mostly amazes adults. The biggest gripes are the oven is unnecessarily small (like they were trying the RFID in the oven as well and it didn't work) and the refrigerator door has HORRIBLE fit and won't close. Overall, for the price this kitchen satisfied and has lots of accessories. If you can live with the bad fit and finish, this is one of the more bargain kitchen toys available 
My daughter got his for her second birthday and loves it. The toy is very durable and so much fun. The voices are also entertaining and educational. Our oven door also works very well. My daughter is kind of rough and this toy lasts throughout the torment, so that's very good. I didn't like that the voice can be kind of hard to hear and the oven is so small, but my daughter enjoys it regardless and that's all that matters 
we bought this kitchen set for our daughter for christmas. thinking since it was little tike it would be the best buy and would stand up for a young child. i have bought little tike before. but I'm not sure I will again. the refrigerator door doesn't even come close to fitting. the oven door is warped one side doesn't close. it repeats the same phrases over and over. the tape from shipping left ink on the doors. we were very disappointed with the whole kitchen set 
I bought this cook set for my 2 yr old little boy for Christmas, he was so excited. He couldn't wait for it to be put together so we sat down and went to work and didn't get very far. There was no stickers or screws at all. Talk about a very disappointed little boy on Christmas morning. As you can imagine I was too. So we never got to see how any of it worked. I would not recommened anyone to buy this toy. 
I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas, and she loves it. The product I feel is designed well, and is small enough to fit in her room. A previous review stated they had difficulty building it, but if you follow the directions (step one shows to leave the screws loose), it goes together easily. My husband and I were able to put this together in less than 1/2 hour including trying to stop our daughter from playing with it while it was under construction. Another reviewer had voiced disappointment over the door to the fridge not closing completely. Ours doesn't close all the way, but it stays closed. No Little Tikes toy I have ever purchases has latches to close the doors. The sound level is great in the high position, and she enjoys the comments it makes. I haven't had any trouble with understanding what the voice is saying as others have commented. We're planning on buying some of the additional food sets for more play. Overall I think this was a great buy, and I feel it will be keeping my daughter (and I!) busy for many many hours ahead 
I purchased this for my 2 boys, 5 and 3, in February. Got it on clearance at Walmart for $19, but would not have wanted to spend much more on it. I debated whether to get this or another kitchen that made cooking sounds but didn't speak in 3 languages, and since we're trying to raise our children bilingual (at least!) we thought having a talking kitchen would be preferable. Unfortunately, the voices are hard to understand - not that they're soft, but there seems to be a lot of mumbling and static, so if you don't know exactly what the voice is saying already, you wouldn't be able to learn that, for example, the spanish word for bacon is "tocino" - it sounds more like "poseena". Beyond that, however, both boys have enjoyed it. It's a little small for the 5-yr old now but they both still play with it. They occasionally get frustrated that only the cookie sheet will fit into the oven (you can't put in a pot or nearly any other cooking vessel from our other playsets). The reason for this is obvious- the sensor for the talking feature is at the top of the oven, thus in order to be close enough to the food for the sensor to respond to whatever is there, the floor of the oven had to be raised rather high. If I had to do it again, I would probably look for a kitchen set that only had cooking sounds and not the talking feature, as it's just not used that often in this house. 
I'm very happy with this purchase for my developing artist who is 2 1/2 yrs old. Living in the caribbean, the sleeves are a bit long but it's exactly what you need for experimenting artists...so I just crank up the air conditioner to not let my artist sweat too much 
I couldn't think up a better way to protect kids clothes than with this apron! The long sleeves are a great feature. It also seems to fit a wide range of toddlers and young children. I love the little pockets for supplies and whatnot. Also, it wipes clean quite easily! This apron is a winner in my book 
Inexpensive and much better protection than dad's old shirt. Heavy clear/printed vinyl. Concerns about fit listed in ratings did not hold true. Purchased for use in pre-k class and apron has lots of growing room could be likely be used for several more years. Nice velcro closures make apron easy for child and teacher. 
So many art smocks are too little for elementary students, but these were big enough to both fit and cover school uniforms! Hooray for no more paint on white shirts 
Very nicely done. Brought it for my grand-daughter who is 5yrs old and it is sturdy and has room to gro 
Harder to get into than I first thought. The kids are anxious to get to "work" and fidget getting into this, the arms are a bit too tight. It seems bulky as well. Better off going old school - daddy's old shirt on backwards 
This is a fun family game. It is educational and a good way for kids to learn the value of a dollar. It does, however, have a million pieces that you could easily lose - which is a nightmare for mom and dad! However, this remains one of my kids favorite games even for my 12 year old 
Growing up, my family always loved playing games, so now that I am starting a family of my own, I've been collecting old favorites for my own "game library." The Game of Life was one of the first games I purchased, but I could not have been more disappointed in the quality of the "new and improved" game. The game I grew up with had the buildings, bridges, houses, etc. permanently embedded into the game board. With the new game, these 3D decorations come off and and have to be placed on the board each time you play. This is my main complaint with the new game. Every time you accidently knock the board or brush one of the buildings with your sleeve, they fall off. Add to this the age-old problems of people not staying in the cars and the spinner not working properly (it's worse in the new game, by the way) and The Game of Life becomes a game of frustration. After one game with the new game board, our family decided we would not play the game again. I am now looking on auction sites trying to find one of the "old fashioned" game boards. They really took a step backwards with this one 
I bought this for my 8 11 year old girls as an extre inexpensive Christmas gift, and I was pleasently surprised how much they enjoy it 
I bought this for my son who is 2 1/2. He loves it. He had to show "peepaw", his grandfather who has a real one. Anytime he's outside he gets it out to ride on. He has several other "ride-on" toys and prefers this one over most of them. He has the Little Tikes Police Car Coupe, and Step 2 Tricycle, the Zip N' zoom car, a radio flyer tricycle and a fisher price quad. The only thing I found is if he leans too much to one side it will tip over. It's pretty sturdy otherwise. Put a little helmet on for safety (just like the adults do on our motorcycycles) and you little one will be just fine 
I bought this for my 2yr old grandson for his birthday so he could have a motorcycle like his Grandma. He LOVED it! The wheels are wide enough to keep it from tipping and it's light enough and just the right size to throw in the car to take along. He has to make his own "motor noise", but that's a plus in my book. No batteries to replace or noises to annoy! Also his very tall 3 1/2 year old brother can ride it comfortably, so I look for it to last a long time 
Step 2 is a fantastic brand, slowly climbing up the ladder alongside Fisher Price, Little Tikes etc. My kid loves motorcycle's, so what better toy to buy than his own ride-on motorcycle! This toy is extremely durable. It might take kids a while to get used to balancing the bike, so that it doesn't topple over - but scrapes and bruises are part of growing up! The bike is a little taller than I thought it would be, which meant that my child was on tiptoes for the first couple of months - but its a strong, cheap and exciting toy for any kid 
We actually got this motorcylce from a neighbor who didn't want it anymore. My daughter was very excited and so was I until she tried to ride it on the sidewalk. It fell right over and she scraped her arm. She's tried several times, but the balance is so off that she can't just sit and go. I'm glad I didn't pay for it 
Most ride on toys are very wide, which make the pushing a little hard. This toy is thin; therefore, my 2 yr old son loves it more than any other push toy. This is so so cute, I wish there was more stickers, but who cares, it is worth the buy! I hated paying for the 8-9 dollar shipping, but motorcycles this cute are hard to find... This is light and easy to throw in the truck to take along 
My son got this for his second birthday and it is his absolute favorite toy ever! Next week is his THIRD birthday and he still plays with it every single day. He rides it in the house, outside down our sloped driveway and even takes it to the park. We actually had to make trails for him in the woods so he could go off-road with it! This toy definitely gets 5 stars in my book! It does sit a little high, but that makes it PERFECT for someone his age 
This product was nothing like how I expected it to be. The quality is terrible, do not waste your money on this item 
The iDog is very cute, but he takes a long time to get going and sucks batteries down in record time. Too bad, because he's a nice way to play your music. 
I love this little dog! I named him Max and he's just the cutest little critter and fun to watch listen to my music 
I just got my pink idog today and think it is just the cutest thing. Although I am just learning how to use it,so far I am just so interested in watching it's movements and colors. The problems that I have encountered are that it is quite difficult to "turn" the pup off and that the "on" button (nose) is much too sensitive. All you have to do is very lightly tap the nose and the pup makes noises. In addition, I have found that the batteries are a pain to insert as you need a screwdriver. I wish like my ipod, there was a "hold" button to avoid accidently activating the toy and "wasting" expensive batteries. I might make the investment and buy re-chargable ones to avoid the cost. Anyway, I look forwars to using it on desk at work 
I've been trying to get some sort of way to listen to my I-Pod without the earbuds. I was not going to spend $100 bucks on another boom box just for I-Pods. So it caught my attention while I was in Herbergers and noticed I could listen to music through the dog. It was cute so I grabbed it. You have to put two AA batteries in the dog's leg. Then you just plug in your I-Pod and instant music. The sound isn't as good as with a stereo system which makes this good for me since I live in a condo and do not want to make a lot of noise. The dog is cute and its head turns and its ears go up and down to the beat of the music. There are also lights that go on and off to the beat of the music too. It also cries and barks. That kinda gets annoying after awhile. It demands attention. And if you pull its tail it growls. You control the songs and volume through your I-Pod. This is a cute cheap way to listen to your I-Pod without spending a lot of money or a lot of hassle. 
I am so disappointed. I remember doing this as a child with far superior results. Why do they have to make toys so cheaply now. I would gladly pay more for a toy that actually does what it says. It does not spin fast enough to evenly distribute paint. My daughter has not seemed to mind yet and is enjoying the toy but knowing how it should operate I am very disappointed. 
This comes with barely enough paint for 2 uses and then no info is given on how to get refills and the store doesn't sell any and they don't even tell you what kind of paint to get. A real pain. 
The box said it came with 10 refillable paint containers, but ours only had 9 bottles, and one of those was empty. No matter, really, it's just a small amount of paint to start with, but why not give people what you tell them you will? The color selection is all right, but not super - you don't get ROYGBIV or anything. It may vary, of course, but we had a lot of light green. Some of them have glitter, which is extra cool and does a good job of making the whole picture sparkle if you add it last. It also comes with a small assortment (40 pieces) of paper -- in both large and small sizes -- of which you are encouraged to reserve the last one as a template to trace and make new ones. Poster board seems to be about the same thickness as the original paper. The smaller "bonus" machine will go fast if you pump the button down repeatedly. By doing this, it actually can go faster than the battery operated one and the paint distributes and spatters very well. The instruction manual, if you can call it that, is pretty limited. It shows in about 3 pictures how to put everything together and operate it. No tips or hints on how to make neat designs. It's the least detailed set of instructions I have seen with an art toy. It comes apart for easy rinsing/wiping. I've always done this immediately after the paint session, and the units are still as clean as they were the first time out of the box. My kids love it. They want to spin pictures every day 
The shuttle bay door will fall off in no time. The booster rockets will be next. The ability to stand it up on the launch pad will last a few days at best. And the robot arm is cheap garbage. This is my experience with a 4 year old boy, but it applies to all ages 
My son is very into space and rockets right now (he's 3) so I thought that he would like this toy. That is an understatement! He LOVES this toy. Every piece is well made and has supplied him with hours of imaginative and inventive play 
This looks like such a great toy, and the packaging is really impressive, but don't be fooled like we were. I assumed that by paying close to 25 dollars it would be somewhat durable-just reasonable durability-I don't expect much from plastic toys...but this is really really bad. You might also think that paying that much would give you things like closable doors...you know, 99 cent matchbox cars' doors stay closed, but the space shuttle's doors don't-which limit it's "fun" factor. The "movable arm" is just a free floating plastic stick that simply is stuck into a hole..It doesn't even stay in. The "launch pad" and the fuel tank/boosters are down right horrible. They don't connect to the shuttle, which was disapointed all of us, especially my son. And it is so cheaply made, I really can't believe that it wasn't bought from the dollar store. My son was so excited for this set. But after playing with it for just a few minutes he hasn't gotten it out again. I would definately NOT recommend this 
The description lies, there are no minifigures, Elite or otherwise, included. Unless you have money to spend for additional sets to get this vehicle a pilot, I wouldn't suggest it as anything other then a display peice. It's shiny though, and as far as I can tell mostly accurate to the game, if not to scale with the other things (This is a problem with all the minifigures...I suggest the 1/6 scale ones instead. 
My son had a great time playing with this toy. I liked the durability ( it made it through Christmas ) 
I've got this thing for my twins for NE=ew Year, and they've been enjoying it for one day so far. We have two sets, and it's much more fun than just one - going one shooter against two robots is indeed a deathwish. I don't know how durable it will prove - the robots suffered some tumbles without ill effects, but it's only been one day. One drawback I found is the toy's inability to go shooter on shooter - for some reasons pistols, when set on team A and team B, refuse to shoot one another. But it's a fun toy nevertheless. The only educational value I can discern in this set is a little bit of understanding of just how stupid the computers are, and may be the realization that the light "bullet" gets reflected off white surfaces, so the robot canshoot you even when its back is turned toward you. Otherwise, not eductaional at all. Thankfully :) 
Our daughter is the youngest and has 2 older brothers. Finally she is playing with a "girl toy". She loves to put all the stuff in, makes calls, and use her "credit card". She is only 2, but enjoys the purse very much and the boys aren't allowed to touch it 
This is my second purchase, the first was a christmas gift for my 2 yr old niece who lives in the UK. She absolutely adores it, and of the virtual "Toys R Us" environment she lives in, this is one of her favorite toys. It's so popular that this second purchase is a birthday gift for one of her playmates 
This is a great purse for my 15 month old girl who loves playing with my wallet and lipstick while riding in the shopping cart. All the pieces are the right size for her little hands and she loves walking around with the cellphone and keys and "putting on" the lipstick. Some of the pieces were lost easily as most of her things get misplaced but overall I'm very happy with this! Oh, and my daughter loves it,too 
I gave this purse to my niece for her second birthday, and she never put it down. The keys and the cell phone were her favorite. She put it on her arm, and was ready to go! I would recommend this to anyone who has a gift to give a little girl. They feel just like Mommy 
My daughter got this purse for her second birthday, she loves the lipstick and the keys. great toy great pric 
This purse is very sturdy and works well for a girl age 2-3, if you don't mind the overtly girly aspect of it (e.g., lipstick and compact). My daughter drags it around outside and in, and it holds up well 
Our 19 month old enjoys playing with this purse. She enjoys the purse itself, the cell phone, and the lipstick the most. The mirror, keys, wallet, and credit card aren't played with much. The only complaint I have is that she is unable to open the wallet on her own. Trying to open the wallet frustrates her to no end--it's hard for a young toddler to have the dexterity to open such a thing 
Our almost 2-year old daughter got this for Christmas, and she still plays with it several months later. Highly recommend. The only thing missing is some dress-up shoes to go along with it :- 
I bought this helmet hoping that it would be big enough to fit an adult. I was pleasantly surprised when it was big enough to wear comfortably! While there is no headband or suspension, the inside is padded with foam, and the whole thing is light enough that it was very comfortable. Any helmet can get stuffy to wear, but the front visor opens up so much that it is very easy to breath, and you could wear this for hours. The electronics are an inside speaker that repeats the same sequence, and the microphone doesn't work, but the overall look is so good that it doesn't matter. I plan on putting together an astronaut suit for this, and it would be a perfect outfit for Halloween parties 
The entire play tent idea is a great idea. However, it does need a little more attention to the velcro snaps to attach the tunnels and tents together into one unit. It isn't durable enough for the price. I had it out for a day, and my daughter didn't last in it. She prefers the schoolbus instead. I can see this toy breaking down with tears very quickly because it is a little fragile 
My twin boys (16 months) love this toy. I would suggest getting at least 100 extra balls. (I have 250 in our ball pit and it really looks fun)) The connections aren't the best, but they work better than other company models that don't have velcro straps. Our kids play in this on and off most of the day. On a cautionary note, this is a fairly large system of tunnels and tents so make sure that you have plenty of room. Of course, you can use the pieces separately to make several smaller play spaces instead of one large area. Overall, I am glad I purchased this and that I didn't wait until the recommended 3 year old age range. 
I purchased this product for my 1-yr old daughter's birthday because she loves to crawl under and through anything. She loves this, too. My 3 sons (3, 7, 12) love it, too, even though the 7 and 12 are a little too big. Set up was very easy, although I have not tried to take it down. It is a little flimsy at the connection points, but not enough that I wouldn't recommend it. I would get more pieces to connect if I had a larger space 
My kids 4 and 6 both love this, I bought it for my 4 year olds birthday. I really liked the fact that it folded flat and was easy to store, however, my husband and I have yet to figure that out! 
We got this for our son about a month ago. He's almost 14 months now, younger than the recommended age of 3 years, but he is never unsupervised when using the playhut. Our son loves to play hide and seek (hiding from us, of course :))inside the playhut, or just going in and retrieving the balls we toss in there for him. He doesn't exactly know what to do with the basketball hoop yet, but I'm sure that will come. He has lost his balance while in the playhut and knocked it down, but it pops right back up. And, since we have it up against a wall, it is more stable anyway. Enjoy 
What a bunch of junk! Upon opening the Megaland, I noticed it was ripped at the seam in one area. This was a pretty large rip I might add. After inspecting it more I noticed about a dozen more places where it was ripped. I noticed another parent said the same thing. Now I know why it's half off! Don't waste your money. 
A little scary. I'm sure it's a fluke,but the one I bought the inside of one tent had an inseam not sewn around the metal frame of tent, therefore a portion of metal frame was available to toddler. Possibility of breaking and small metal pieces was all I could invision.Therefore I sent product back. The other 2 tents were in perfect condition, as was the 3 tunnels, so as I said,I'm sure it's a fluke, but didn't want to take a chance for my 2yr old 
This set up is a bit flimsy and the tunnels don't have anything to connect them to the tent. My son still loves it but I wish it was a bit more sturdy 
it is a good toy but the balls are rather small and youmust check the seams when they arrive for poor sowin 
We have had this shopping cart for 3 years now. I have 2 active girls who love to play with it. It does not show any wear after 3 years it has been rammed into walls and pushed down the stairs. I think it is very sturdy worth the money 
We bought this shopping cart for my daughter's birthday to replace the cheapie one she'd had before. Her previous one had cost under $10 (a gift) and there is no comparison between that one and the Little Tikes one. The old one was flimsy from the get go, faded quickly, and when it broke, left sharp edges in the plastic. The Little Tikes cart is much, much sturdier and safer. I put it together in less than 30 minutes, even with my daughter's 'help'. There's a nice deep basket that holds a good amount of pretend play food or whatever else your child wants to push around. The seat for a doll folds against the cart just like a real shopping cart, and easily holds a good variety of different style dolls. The empty shelf under the basket is a nice touch, perfect for stashing more groceries. This cart is definitely worth the extra money, and I'd gladly buy it again 
Let me start by saying my son has had this toy for over three years and it is his absolute favorite. Since he's had it so long I can tell you its very durable. We haven't had any problems. This is the one and only toy he has used every single day since we bought it. He uses it for pretty much everything, but especially for cleaning up. He uses it to gather up all of his toys and take them to his bedroom to put away. He also loves to use it to play store. The only problem with this toy: when his friends come over they want to play with it too! Maybe I should get a few more of them! I would highly recommend this toy to anyone! 
We had this grocery cart for three years. I would give the basket and base ten stars for sturdiness. After lots of play though, the wheels will no longer stay; I got tired of "popping" them back into place. Overall, three years has been a good lifetime for this toy 
Without a doubt, this is the best shopping cart available! 1. Sturdy 2. The little seat for a baby doll- easy to get baby doll in and out and it makes it more like the real thing. 3. Holds a ton of food. Both of our kids, 26 mo. girl and 15 mo. boy love this! 
We bought this cart for our 16 month old daughter and it's a hit. She loves pushing her "baby" in it and filling it with "groceries." I love that it's so sturdy compared to the others on the market and very hard to tip over. At first I wasn't thrilled about the price but I was sold after comparing it with the others. It's very durable and high quality. I know this one will last. 
This product is fun for my 2 year old. She loves to push it around with her dolls riding inside. As for parents, It is an easy thing to use to help clean up toys as it has a decent sized basket and it rolls pretty easy 
I bought it for my niece, she love it, play with it instantly. I did not buy the accesories because she use any single toy she had and put on it 
It's a wonderful board game. My daughter loves it and she never gets bored playing. 
Some people hate monopoly, others love it. Me, I like it. I've been playing it for nearly 20 years, ever since I can remember. You really should pick up this fantastic board game and play it with your family and children. If you don't, you will be missing out on one amazingly popular game 
I remember reading LotR and I loved the series and the Peter Jackson version. Once I heard of the Monopoly edition of LotR, I was excited. I soon won the LotR Monopoly edition. I came home, invited some relatives and soon had a great time! As you know, Monopoly is a game inwhich you have to be the ultimate monopoly. You buy and sell property, and if you own Mt. Doom and Bara-dur (Boardwalk and Park Place in the original Monopoly) then you get a monopoly. You can build strongholds (houses) and fortresses (hotels) and everytime a rival lands on your property, then he has to give you power (money). If you can't pay the rent then you'll become bankrupt and you are out. You also have to avoid jail. There is some new tokens that resemble characters from LotR. If you had a look at the screenshots of this Monopoly game then you'll notice a lot of changes. But there is a new optional rule you can play with in this version; everytime you roll an "Eye of Sauron" (also counts as one) the golden ring will move to one territory per eye, where you can add strongholds. If you land on a territory with the ring, you may get it for FREE! If you land on an owned territory with the ring on it, you have to pay double the rent. So, if you are a 100% die-hard LotR that only enjoy the books, then you can miss. But if you are looking for a Monopoly board or for LotR stuff, I recommend this game then Note: If Tolkien lived to see this, he would have died immediatly. Infact, I think he's rolling in his grave as I am typing this review. 
Monopoly is a game where you buy properties that have been mortgaged by the owners, and you must buy them for a ****load of money. It is absolutely the best board game series ever made. There are tons of special editions for monopoly, for example: Spongebob Simpsons Family Guy This product is a must buy. BUY IT NOW 
What makes this monopoly version special is the Large Tokens and the difeerent styles of houses and hotels. I love how they made the tokens bigger and heavier. The are also about four different styles of houses and hotels for a little variety in housing. The money holder has felt on it to make it a little more fancy then standard plastic and of course the case is metal instead of the standard cardboard box. Other than that it is the same game. The only complaint I had is that I thought looking at the tin on the shelf that it was a silver and gld colored tin, but it is only siver. The gold is only on the plastic around the tin. 
I had a hard time finding dishes for someone under 3 years of age. these were perfect for a 2 year old. she really enjoys them, and loves making "soup Hot" for her daddy. it includes pots and pans and little a spatula and serving spoon so she learns how to use these things. It helps with dexterit 
I know alot about the impressionist already. So getting this game was just to add to my collection. I actually was impressed I learned something new. The writing and explanations are pretty simple, because it's geared towards children, but I still enjoyed it. 
We gave this toy to our son for Christmas when he was 7 months old and he just loved it and still does at almost a 1 year old. It was fun watching his motor skills improve while using this toy. At first he mostly banged the noise making nails and did really grasp the ball dropping, storage compartment, crank or spinning ball. Little by little he added what he could do with this toy. Soon he was able to get the balls out of the compartment and drop them in the bottom hole, then soon in the top hole. He now wails with the little plastic hammer on the nails and just loves it. We haven't had to replace the batteries yet. I highly recommend this toy for developing motor skills 
My one year olds twins received this for Christmas along with the Discover Sounds Kitchen. My daughter sticks her hand down the ball drop hole to pick up a ball instead of getting a ball from the side pocket. Once she has the ball in her hand, she cannot get her hand back out and hasn't figured out to drop the ball. This has happened three different times. Once, she walked off dragging the workshop behind her until I caught up with her. She was not injured, but was very upset. I sit right next to her when she is playing with the workshop, or put it up. My twins use the Discover Sounds Kitchen more often and we have not had any problems with it. 
My 11 month old son received this for Christmas. He loves it, and goes to it more than all the other toys he got for christmas. Easy for little fingers, entertaining, and great for practicing fine motor-- pounding, pushing, turning. Little Tykes really hit the mark on this one! Much better than the kitchen that my daughter had 
Just wanted to write a quick review. We have the older version - we purchased it for our daughter when she was 9months and that was in 2001!! And at 4 she was STILL playing with it! It has always been a favorite of hers. Sometimes we have put it away because I thought she wasn't interested in it anymore, but when she discovers it or it comes back out, she won't stop playing with it. 
My son received this workshop at about 8 months still plays with it all the time at 19 months. He mostly enjoys dropping the balls through the chute cramming things into the overhead compartment. We also bought the Discover Sounds hammer that is sold as an accessory, but it was really too heavy for him to use at first. He still doesn't pay that much attention to it. The light-weight hammer that comes with the workshop is just fine. The workshop is durable also. My daughter sits on the nails, so far it has held up well 
We have the Discover Sounds Kitchen (which is great) so I decided to try this toy. It is not nearly as interesting as the kitchen but the girls do enjoy the ball drop and the nails. I think it's a decent toy for the price, but I wish it had more interesting parts to it. 
This was the first real toy we bought my son (other than real baby toys), he was 6 months at the time. From the moment we brought it home, he LOVED it! It comes with three balls that you drop in a slot and they come rolling out - he never got into that part even to this day but he loved and loves hitting the different parts of the workbench with the hammer and hearing the sounds and seeing the lights flash. It also has a winding crank and some other great little features that kids love. Now he is 20 months and although it's no longer one of the main toys he plays with I do see him go over and give it a whirl here and there and I still see the same excitment in his eyes just like the first time. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get rid of this toy not because my son is so attached but because I am attached to the memories of his very first toy and would hate to see it go 
My son received this toy for Christmas last year when he was 9 months old. He is now 18 months old and still doesn't play with it. It just doesn't hold his interest. ON the other hand, he could play all; day with the plain old Little Tikes workbench. This is definitely not worth the money - there are more entertaining work bench toys out there 
This is the game that comes out first at family holiday gatherings. It is easily modified for the younger age group gets them thinking in ways other than the usual children's game. My 4 6 year old grandchildren love it I recently purchased it for my daughter-in-law as a birthday gift. However, the timer is not well constructed it broke very soon after purchase on both my game others I have purchased for friends. It is a hard game to find but Amazon has come through on more than one occassion 
The play of the game itself is great -- similar to Scattergories in that you'll be coming up with words that fit a certain category and are looking for them to start with certain letters of the alphabet, but with several twists that make it even more entertaining. The one beef I really had with this game is that the deck of available categories is too small -- in just two or three games you'll begin to repeat categories. So, you may wish to augment the deck with categories of your own 
Three of us sat down and decided to try this game and we ended up playing for 4 hours. It is very easy to learn and yet challenging to play. Oh, it's also a lot of fun 
This is one game that the kids - and the adults - ask to play agian and again. It's a must on our family vacations -- one of the few things everyone can agree on. Easy and very fun to play. Highly recommende 
I purchased this game 5 years ago and have been searching for more because all my family and friends wanted their own copies! We were familiar with Fundex toys (Phase 10) and wanted a family game that ages 6-86 could play together and THIS IS THAT GAME! The rules are easy, the game is never the same, everyone has fun 
NICE BABY GIFT FOR NEWBORN.....I ATTACHED A GIFT CERTIFICATE AND A BIG BOW ...EASY BABY SHOWER GIFT... 
We got this cube before my son was born. He has enjoyed playing with it since he was very small. First he would just look at it, then he started moving the flap with the bullseye and now he grabs all the different parts of it and really manipulates it. The different rings and sections to grab make this a great toy for a child learning to reach. My son is now six months old and he still enjoys this toy 
This is my son's favorite toy. He has been playing with it since he was a month old. He loves to here it jingle, and open the flap and see the panda bear. He is now 4 months old and it is still his favorite toy. I can give him this to play with in his bouncy seat and it keeps him occupied for a long time. I've also attached it to his baby gym and he loves grabbing at it. Highly reccommend it 
My baby got this when she was 6 weeks old. She was liking it by the time she was 2 months old. She now is 4 1/2 months old and still enjoys it. Great educational toy with the different colors and textures. Awesome for young baby 
Our 3 month daughter loves this toy. It has multiple shapes and colors for visual devlopment and enough different textures to keep her busy while I write this review. Very good product 
I know that the Amazon description says that this is for babies 3 months to 2 years, but I just had to buy this early after I read all of the great reviews. When it arrived, I attached it to the activity gym (I uploaded a photo of it if you are interested in seeing how I did this). My baby boy, Benjamin, immediately grabbed it. He was only 6 weeks old at the time, so I am sure that it was just a coincidence, but it made me feel bad that I had not offered him toys at a level he could reach before this. Throughout that first day, he became fascinated with the toy. He quickly learned how to grab (even though his depth perception is still off) and I believe that this toy helped him develop his "grabbing skills" faster than if I had not purchased this toy. I am sure that this toy is going to get a lot of use from my baby boy. He has now decided that it is more fun to kick it than to grab it. Personally, I believe that this toy should have a lower age recommendation. He was only half way there and I know I could have given it to him sooner. 
My 3 month old loves the cube. I attach it to whatever I can, it goes everywhere with us 
It is a very educating and entertaining toy; my baby is only 6 months old and he loves it! He shakes it and scratches it! 
My 6 yr. old son received this for Christmas. He loves it and so do I! I think he likes playing hang man the best. It's cool that it has a light so he can play at night 
I bought this for my 5 year old son for Christmas. Not only did he think it was great but also his 7 and 9 year old sisters. There are so many games that there was something for all of them. We took the toy with us to Grandma's and even the older cousins found it very fun and entertaining. I really like that they can play all the games in Spanish too. Once they have got the hang of a game in English they can do it in Spanish and it helps increase their vocabulary. I was a little nervous if it would be worth the $50 because I had seen the barbie laptops and some others at radio shack. This one seemed like the best choice and was hoping this would be worth it. In my opinion it is much better than the others we tried in the store and I would definately recommend it 
My 6 year son loves this! The sides open up, the lights come flashing on and it's easy to open. The games are fun and keeps him entertained for hours! I would definitely recommend 
I came across this item by accident while doing my Christmas shopping yesterday. Not only am I sure my 6 year old son will LOVE this...I LOVE IT! LOL! It is really cool. You push the top and it pops open while the wings shoot out. There is flashing lights and sounds. You have to put in any number of codes all beginning with BAT to access the games and activities. It has a keyboard on it just like a real laptop which I am thrilled with. Now my son can type on his computer instead of mine! LOL! I played with it myself for probably half an hour. Sure there are some things he wont be able to do but it wouldnt be much fun if he already knew how to do it. It is definately something that will be with him for awhile. The only small complaint I would have is that the screen could be bigger. For the size of the top of the laptop the actual screen that is used is very small. I dont see why they could not have utilized more of the screen and still had room to list the bat codes. Either way, I am sure any Batman fan would love this, any little boy will love this...and any mother who is looking for a cool, fun, EDUCATIONAL toy will LOVE this! The best part for me is the lights you can turn on. There is probably 2 or 3 settings for the lights that help you see the screen so much better. That is a great feature as well as the wings which dont really add much except that it will make any young boy think he has something Batman might actually use! I TOTALLY reccommend this "toy" for anyone with boys ages 5 to 7 or even 8 
I bought this computer for my just turned 5 year old. While he thinks it is really cool, it is a bit hard for him. Of the 26 games, he can play 6. I am happy that it is a toy he can grow with and it can teach him a lot. The graphics are great but I do wish the volume could be turned down one more setting. I do wish there was a setting that they could just type letters to learn the keypad. All in all, a good investment. 
My two little girls , 2 and 3 years old, love this table and use every day. I bought it about a month ago and it is still their favourite toy. They love it so much they want to eat their meals at it also. It was expensive but well worth the money. I love the fact that there is enough space on the benches that their friends can sit and create. The table is also large enough that each child has their own drawing space 
I've seen this table in quite a few magazines and tossed the idea aside because of the price. I found the exact table, same brand and everything in Costco for $49.99. So of course I bought it and am glad I did. My kids love to do all of their projects on this table. It is durable and has plenty of room for my 3 kids to sit at. 
My 2y daughter received this on 2nd bday and she has not let it go since, (7mo). Dora "feeds" the baby bro/sis with the bottle in her hand, while it (bottle)makes good sound effects. There is also a pretend plate of carrots/peas/potatoes and comes with 2 spoons, very good role-modeling as Dora is the big sister. The songs she sings are very sweet, as both the songs and the questions she asks engage my daughter in fun role playing. 
My 2 yr. old daughter and I were at a store shopping for her birthday presents ( a little early ) and when she saw this dora doll with her baby sister and baby brother she wouldn't put it down, and since I bought it for her she has slept with her every night, this doll is practically attached to my daughter. Every time dora asks, "do the babies want some more?" after feeding them my daughter giggles and says "ok dora" it's amazing how she interacts with this doll. It's deffinatly worth the money to buy it! 
My daughter adores Dora and has been asking for this toy. She received it for Christmas and is thrilled. I love it because it is a very sturdy toy. The babies are heavy duty plastic and Dora is half plastic, half cloth. My daughter has been sleeping with the Dora. She is enjoying pretending to feed the babies and put them in Dora's carrier. This toy is great for play acting as well as wonderful if you are trying to get your child ready for a little brother or sister, although you might want to educate your child that they won't be able to carry their new sibling around in a carrier like Dora until they are much older 
I see most of the reviews come from mom's of 2 year old, but heck my 7 year old daughter just had to have this doll, and actually, her 3 year old brother just loves it too. They both like to cuddle and feed the babies! 
We bought this for my daughters 2nd Birthday. She loves it. She will sit and play with the babies for hours. She loves the bottle that comes with them. The only thing that i wish is the babies were softer. They are a very hard plastic and she loves cuddling with them. I think it would be easier for her if they wre soft and not hard. Other then that this doll is cute!! 
I ordered three sets of these Dora dolls. They are the cutest thing I have seen. I know my 2 and 4 year old granddaughters will love them. They appear to be well made. Fabric stores carry fleece "Dora" material. I bought some and made doll blankets with it just by cutting a fringe around the outside. I can't wait until Christmas to see their eyes light up when they see the dolls with matching blankets 
My 4 year old daughter asks every day to have this Big Sister Dora for Christmas. I love it. She doesn't know I already have it hidden in the closet for her. She even drew an awesome picture of Dora holding both babies for Santa so he can get it just right. I loved this idea the second they came out with it. I love that it helps my daughter love her role in our family as "Big Sister." What a positive idea! Who doesn't need more excitement to help their child welcome a sibling into the world? I love too, that there are twin babies. My daughter is already planning to share one of the babies with her little sister. Although, we only have 2 girls at this time, they know that someday we can welcome a new little brother or sister into our family as well. I would highly recommend this toy. I mean, what little girl doesn't love Dora 
Let me just say this: my 4 year old is a certifiable Dora nut. She loves her. You could give her a bag with Dora on it and she'd think it was the cat's meow. But, I must say, Mom-Mom came through big with this toy for her 4th birthday. She loves that Dora feeds the twin babies from the bottle attached to her hand. She loves the little song that Dora sings about being a Big Sister when she presses Dora's hand. She's already singing it around the house. The feeding accesories are cute and durable as well and the twin babies themselves are all too cute in and of themselves. Also, Since my four-year old daughter is a twin as well - she has a twin brother - I think she can really relate to this toy on that level as well. Great toy 
My children and I are very happy with big sister Dora. My 18 month old baby sleeps with Dora's baby brother and sister in her hands. My three children enjoy playing with the doll, they love putting the babies in Dora's carrier. I wish they also sold the babies separately 
OK, so my daughter appears to like the toy, but it is driving me crazy!! The music and the singing voice are incredibly annoying -- by far the most annoying of all her toys (which is saying something). Furthermore, whatever educational value there may have been in the voice saying "red pan in" when the red pan is placed on top of the yellow one was subverted when my daughter figured out (within 2 minutes of opening the box) how to press a button and get the same result. So we just hear "red pan in! red pan...red pan...red...red..." over and over. I personally am suspicious that these toys that have so many sounds and lights and music and voices etc etc do not encourage the development of imagination. 
We have had 2 of these toys - they both had the same problem as others - only says "red pan in/out" If you slam it hard on the floor it occasionally will sing, but this is also random. The fisher-price rep. did not seem surprised when I called to report this - told me to keep the toy I had sent me a voucher for a new toy. 
I bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old. She has played with it absolutely everyday since then (she is now a year). At six months she didn't really play with it the way it's meant to be played but she enjoyed banging the pans around and listening to the music. Now she works on stacking them and using the shape sorter. Great toy to grow with 
Parents find the songs really annoying!! :) My baby thinks this is the greatest toy ever! He is 10 months old and had these for about two months so far. He loves taking the pots out and putting them back and getting them to play music, over and over and over and over.... We do have to put it away every once in a while so it doesn't drive us crazy, but for baby, it's great! 
This toy taught my son how to stack in a day. It is such a cute toy, and my son loves to beat everything with it. It has cute, silly songs, and as far as our toy goes it plays very easy. The only thing I don't like is the spoon, because it doesn't have a place. If you put it in the pot then you aren't able the sort the blocks. Overall, it's a good toy! 
My son loved the learning table so I really thought the pots and pans would be a big hit when I purchased them when my son was 8 mo old. I could not get the product to say anything but, "Red pan in, Red pan out". I called the hotline at Fisher Price and they told me to change the battery which I had already done. While I was on the phone, my son dropped the pot and it began to sing the alphabet song. The cust. service rep. told me that the pots said and sang things at random and that it reponds when manipulated like a child would. I was disapointed because the toy responds VERY randomly and usually only sings if it is shaken very hard or dropped. I really feel I wasted my money on this one 
This toy looks very appealing. I purchased this for my son, 16 months at the time thinking it would be a great toy to stash in the kitchen cupboard so he could play while I cooked cleaned etc. He played with it about 4 times total and he's 2 now! It doesn't do enough and does have much other than a shape sorter. I consider it wasted money but if my experience helps anyone I'm glad 
I bought this because she is at that age of stacking things. I thought this would be perfect for her. However it is not enough. There is only two things to stack and the spoon doesn't really have a place for it. Also the numbers on it doesn't have any interaction with it, meaning it is just printed on the toy and that is it. The sorting of the shapes are a great idea however and it is very durable. She will bang on it with the spoon as well. I guess for the price I was disappointed. But she does have fun with it 
I got my stunning Baby Born off Ebay today. She is a different kind of Baby Born, but if I reviewed the exact doll she was then no one would read my review. She is absolutely adorable and so cuddly. Her skin feels like a real baby's and she looks so much like a newborn it's unbelievable. Her toes are individual-perfect for playing This Little Piggy! Her hands are so lovely and baby-like. She is kissably cute and fun to hold. And she can squeak! I love to make her squeak. Even my cousin (who is not that fond of baby dolls) likes her! I've gotten so many compliments on my baby. I love her so much. She is even heavy like a real baby! I love giving her a pacifier. She is so cute I don't want to put her down! What a fantastic toy! I totally recommend this for any doll lovers. She is cute, sized and weighted like a real baby, and soooo realistic. Not for younger kids, though. Definitely more 7-14 year olds. My 13 bucks was well spent on my new baby! If you want this baby then go for it!! I am going to get lots of new accessories for her off Ebay!!! If you are planning to get her, you should get some accessories to go with her and you should look on Ebay. This doll is sooooo worth the money! Outstanding!!! 
Unlike all the bad reviews on this doll, I want to say how wonderful this doll is she does everything it says on the box, I know a lot of people says she doesn't cry but she does it takes a while if your child plays with her a lot and feeds her the right way she will cry, our doll cry's every time my daughter squeezes her hand, even my 8 year old son loves to make her cry, it is over all a great doll my daughter dresses her in different outfits and take her everywhere she goes... 
My daughter got this doll 2 years ago and it is still her favorite! She still plays with it, swims with it and bathes with it. It is a great doll 
I am now in college- studding to be a teacher. I however got the orriginal "Baby Born" doll when I was one. It was my first doll ever and I still have her. I named her Molly when I was three and would carry her every where. I of course had the orriginal that didnt do as much as todays baby born- mine did not cry, make noises, go potty but I had an imagination and in my eyes she was real. (I watched "A little princess" and believed that all dolls were alive) But Baby born to me was more than a doll. I recamend baby born for all little girls- and the women who said baby born is ugly- well I dont know about other adults but the adults that my parents knew thought my doll was a real baby- until they would see me spin with her and they would have a heart attact and then realize its a doll...that they all thought was life like and adorable. I love baby born and I am now going to buy one for my cousin Jordan as her first real baby doll. 
This is the best kitchen out there. My kids have had it for about a year now. (4 and 2, a girl and a boy) And they LOVE it. They play with it everyday. We have TONS of kitchen accesories and they all fit. The freezer is one open space, the fridge has one shelf, the stove has one shelf and the pantry has one shelf. So this doubles as your storage too. My husband put it together, no problems. And i must add...the box came very damaged (it's very heavy and i guess the ups guy wasn't happy about that). It ended up that 4 major pieces were badly damaged. I called kidkraft and they sent brand new pieces (the big sides) no questions asked!!! so to top off a great product is a great company. 
My daughter LOVES this kitchen, however, it takes some time to put together and there are so many pieces! Definitely a 2 person project 
It is a beautiful kitchen - my 3yo loves it - I bought a lot of food and stuff to go with it and she gets a total kick out of it. The microwave plastic came cracked and it was so involved putting it together that we didn't bother un assembling it and sending it back 
I purchased this kitchen last Christmas for my girls. When it arrived, both my husband and I were amazed at the quality. Assembly instructions(although it takes a few hours) were very clear and all of the parts and pieces were color coded and numbered. I consider this piece to be "furniture quality." To top it off, it is absolutely adorable and my girls (2 and 4) love to play with it. It is definitely the type of piece that can be passed down from generation to generation. If you are considering purchasing some of the kitchen sets from the pricier mall/catalog stores (you KNOW which ones I am talking about), consider this first. 
My girls love this kitchen. They play with it everyday. It has a lot of storage so you can store play food, dishes, etc 
We bought this for my daughter's 3 year birthday and it was a huge hit. It is very solid, a nice size (almost 4 ft high by almost 4 feet long), big enough for 2 children to play with simaltaneously, and most of all NOT PLASTIC. My husband and I were amazed at the quality for the price and I think my daughter will get several years worth of play out of it it. I highly recommend it (keep in mind it took my husband 2-3 hours to assemble)! 
We bought this for our girls (4 and 2 yrs) last Christmas so we have last year's model so I can vouch for how well this has held up. They still love it and play with it daily. Great wooden design and sturdy construction, but let me tell you this is no small undertaking to assemble; it is easy but time consuming. If I only could have paid Santa to assemble! Other than that, as compared to the other wooden kitchens, it is a great product at this price point and much better quality than the plastic ones that make noises etc. as it is larger and in reality kids will use their imagination and don't need all that other stuff. My girls cook, bang, open doors and shove stuff in it and it takes it like a champ! The only drawback is that is is primarily made in feminine colors so if you have a little man that loves to cook Target now carries a great little wooden kitchen that is blue and has a stainless steel look to it plus they carry great wooden food and accessories. 
I bought the type with the fridge attached. My daughter loves it. I researched kitchen sets well, and this by far was the most reccommended! Love it Love it Love it! 
I bought the model with the refrigerator and phone for my granddaughter and it is so precious! I was expecting something screwed together and flimsy but KidKraft uses metal screw plugs (I can't remember what they are really called) to put this together and it is very sturdy and the screws won't strip out the pressed wood. (It does weigh 80#s!) The hardware that is used to put this together is all organized in a little tray so it was very easy for me to find what I needed, normally you have to spend the first hour sorting out the screws. The directions are pretty easy to follow, I only had problems figuring out how to attach the top but it only took me a few minutes to get it right. I am a woman who has my own tools so I tackled this project by myself and it took me a couple of hours, if I had had help it probably would have been completed much more quickly. (I do recommend tearing off the page with the tray items to keep handy so you aren't constantly flipping back to that page since you need the tray items on every step.) My granddaughter's eyes lit up when she saw it and she played in there for hours (she will be three in January and loves to play pretend). This is such a cute addition to her girly room and I simply love the pastel colors. I love the quality and the design. Perfect 
I just purchased this game for my 3-1/2 year daughter. She is a Dora fan, so she wanted to play it immediately. She sat there and played the entire game in one sitting. Basically, Dora and Boots are on an adventure to help find pieces for Tico's aircraft. Swiper makes his regular appearances as well. I had to help her understand how to do something in a couple of places, but otherwise it was right at her level. She knows her numbers and colors and she was very excited that she was able to progress. The best part about the game, in my opinion, is that your little one will be able to make jumps without any problem. The Pooh game is her other favorite (and another great game), but she needs help in making some of the jumps. In the Dora game, Dora won't fall if you keep walking when you are supposed to jump - she just leans over on his tippie toes like she is going to fall. My daughter was especially proud of the fact that she was able to jump on the swinging vines. I highly recommend this game! 
I bought this for my 5yo daughter. It's actually one of the better Dora games I've seen. Runs very similarly to the television show. Offers a little bit more Spanish than the show does. It's probably a tad on the 'easy' side for its age group though as my daughter didn't find it particularly difficult, but that didn't phase her interest any. It's now become one of her favorites V Smile games 
Just purchased this for my 7 year old son that has cerebral palsey- He only has use of his right hand- this cartridge is perfect- game does not allow mistakes and can play this cartridge with only one hand and not both. Since my son has use of only one hand he has trouble playing the other vsmile games- he's hooked. Is very engaging also where some of the other games fall short 
My son neo (4 1/2) got this game yesterday we opened it and he played all the way throught the learning adventure with out stopping. The controls for this game seem alittle more responsive than the older games. Dora speaks in both english and spanish: colors, numbers, and animals. If you are going to get another smartridge this is the one to get 
I have been waiting for this game to come out for my daughter as a reward for potty training. My daughter just turned 3 and this game was very easy for her navigate, as the previous poster stated some of other V-Smile games are hard to control. The graphics and characters voices are as if your watching the Cartoon Dora. This game is also very educational with teaching spanish and english colors and numbers. Also they teach animal sounds and recognition of animals (both underwater and farm animals). Today was the first day we had it so I'm sure I'm missing a lot in this review, but this game is by far the best V-Smile game of them all and we have all the V-Smile games (we keep up to date when the new games come out). 
This is a great game for the little ones just starting out with v-smile. Dora is very easy to control. Unlike the Lion King game where it's quite hard to jump from object to object, in this game you cannot miss your target. My daughter loves this game 
No more quick-swingers sitting on pitches, and frustrating even the most creative movement pitchers. Now, with a quick twist of the red centerpiece, Wiffle Ball has added a new pitch - a real fastball (without the wiffled movement) - to keep those batters in check. This ball does amazing things with that little changeable ring. I just wish the quality were a little better so the red ring wouldn't fly off as easily after a well-hit pitch, which also sometimes causes the ball to start cracking around the center. But with that said, a Junk Ball easily lasts at least one 7-inning, two-out game. And, oh, the trickery 
My son loves the episode II clone troopers (especially the ones from the animated 'Clone Wars' I II series. When he saw this, there was no question that he had to have it! Along with the "Hunt for Grievous" clone trooper 5-pack, this is his favorite amongst all of the Star Wars action figures and vehicles. The only draw back is the rear turret which bends when you set it on a flat surface and the repelling hooks on the back, which have long strings that seem an afterthought in the design 
This is by far the best paint job on a republic gunship! The republic gunship has been the rarest vehicle in the prequel trilogy since 2002. It has been repainted 4 times now, and this is the most unique. It is painted to look like the gunship used in volume 2 of the clone wars, when the ARC's are going to save the jedi from general grievous. It goes along great with the hunt for grievous battle pack. You can recreate one of the best parts of the clone wars with this vehicle 
The luckiest outcome of the prequel trilogy was the Clone Wars cartoon. All of the toys from this series are fantastic. My daughter literally gasped when I showed her the display I'd made. The Tiger Shark Gunship is another good addition to the line 
For those of you complaining that this game is too simplistic for adults, try playing the adult version! This is the true game and not at all like the simple kids version. The game is described on the Sorry! rules sheet. Instead of the cards being drawn one at a time as in the kid's version, each player is dealt a five card hand. This opens a whole new level of strategy as the game then becomes dependent not so much on the luck of the draw, but how the cards are played! With these rules the game can be played for a lifetime and never grow stale 
Even my 4-year-old can play this game with ease (albeit with someone older reading the cards until he got familiar with the rules). The skills required to play the game are skills that transfer easily to everyday life...decision-making, strategizing, taking setbacks in stride...plus it's tons of fun! I highly recommend this game to both kids and adults 
Sorry is a now-classic game that is derivative of Pachisi, one of the oldest known board games. Players are simply trying to get all of their pieces from their starting place to the end. It's not that simple, though, other players can kick you back to your start (Sorry!) in their own maneuvering to get to their end. This game has clearly withstood the test of time and will be a favorite in your house for many years to come 
Sorry has been an excellent game in working with my first and second grade boys as well as my sixth grade girls. The boys can practice counting and reading while everyone has lessons in sportsmanship. Excellent choice 
Parker Brothers' classic game, Sorry!, is one of those board games that should be in every household. An updated form of the Indian game Parcheesi, Sorry! is a competitive game of revenge where players race to be the first to get all four of their pawns into their "Home" square on the board. Game play is simple: On a player's turn, he or she draws a card from the middle of the board. The cards are numbered 1-12, and there are also several special "Sorry!" cards. Most of the numbered cards indicate how many spaces forward the player can move one of his pawns, although some cards have special instructions. If a player draws a card numbered 1 or 2, they can move a pawn from Start onto the game board. (A 2 card also allows the players to draw again.) A 4 card indicates that the player must move a pawn backwards four spaces. If a player draws a 7, he has the option of splitting the move between two pawns. An 11 gives the player a chance to switch places with an opponent's pawn. And a Sorry! Card lets the player take a pawn from Start and place it on the same square as an opponent's pawn, bumping the opponent back to Start. Game play can get very fierce and intense as players race around the board, trying to be the first to get all four pawns Home. If one player's pawn bumps into another player's pawn on the game board, the bumped pawn has to go back to Start-which can make the players really competitive and vengeful. Sorry! is just one of those games that everyone should have in their closet. It's easy enough for kids to play, but it's fun for grown-ups, too. 
I've played this game since I was a teeny kid and it's still a ton of fun. As with most games, there are small pieces involved that very well may end up someplace where they're not supposed to, plus you can't really afford to lose any of the pieces. Plastic bag 'em 
My kids love this game. They sit down together and play this game all of the time. The neighbor kids come over to our house because they love to play board games and SORRY is the one they choose the most. We do not have video games at our house, and this was considered a drawback to the neighbor kids until my kids introduced them to board games. Now they come over all of the time just to play board games. I say hide the video games and let the kids interact with each other playing board games. Sorry is top game in our house 
It's the game of *sweet revenge*. Who wouldn't like this came, a game that as been played for decades and decades. I remember sitting in our sunny sunroom with my brother playing when we were both children, I am now a mother and a Family Daycare provider and my son (6 yrs) and the children I care for enjoy playing. After school my son and the older children run and get a game to play instead of turning on the tv and 7 times out of 10 they pick Sorry. This game can be played by children as young as 3 or 4 yrs and children that are as young as 101.This is a game everyone should own!!! I think I am going to go now, get my son and have a game of Sorry 
i needed a kitchen for my 3 yr old daughter that would fit into a very small space...but one that was enjoyable to play with. we received it very quickly, in time for her birthday, and although she has not played with it yet; i did a test run on it and it seems to be made very well; especially for the price. it is small but has many different little areas that she can work on that either slide out or open up. It would probably be difficult for more than two children, max, to really play with this at the same time (again b/c of the size) unless they had some other accompanying toys like table and chairs so that one child could be the chef and the others could help preapre the food at the table or be the customers, taking turns, etc... as for the tipping over part that another reviewer mentioned, hers will be against a wall; as i think most people have their toy kitchens so i dont think that would be a problem. in all; a good basic kitchen for a great price 
I purchased this kitchen because of its colors and the challenge it provides to my three year old son with a disability. He need to be able to go against gravity and this toy has helped him a whole lot. For my son it is for therapy, for my daughter is is a toy. I wish it was sturdy, but for me, it served the purpose 
We bought this kitchen for my 3 yr old son for christmas. After searching through other kitchens we decided on this one for many reasons. First we liked that it was not huge and overbearing, and with the minimal sounds and electronic functions there is still plenty of room for using his imagination which was important to us. Both burners light up, one makes a "frying" sound, the other a "boiling" sound. It is compact enough to move around easily, we like to keep it in the kitchen as well as the living room and outside on the nice days. Secondly we liked that chicco got it right with regards to the usually discriminating gender biased kitchen sets of pinks and purples. subdued primary colors are used in the chicco kitchen making it appealing to both genders. Lastly the price for this kitchen was a bargain compared to others out there, especially since we were not sure how much my son would really use it. Although my son has played with it in the company of another child with ease, I would reccomend getting something bigger if you have two children constantly playing with the kitchen as it is rather small or in conjunction with other kitchen items that can be placed near it like a microwave or coffee pot, so the focus is not just on one item at at given time 
My 3 year old and my 1 year old play so nicely together with this toy. My only complaint is that it could be heavier on the bottom; it's toppled over a couple of times. Otherwise, it's great; they love the 'burners' which make noise light up. I bought some more accessories because there's not too many included 
My son has always tried to "cook" with the real pots and pans and always asked for a spoon to stir his food with so in order to keep our real stuff clean, I decided to get him his own kitchen for Christmas this year. When he woke up Chrismtas morning, he went straight for this toy and played with it for an hour before even looking at the other toys and presents. And it only took maybe 5 minutes to assemble--quite a bonus for Christmas Eve. The reasons I chose this one was because it is in primary colors so it's OK for boys and girls, it doesn't take up much space and it was reasonably priced. As others mentioned it is easy to tip over since it's small especially for younger kids (like my son) who really want to reach the top storage area but are a bit too short. I've started to make sure it's against the wall or refrigerator so it can't get knocked over. With reference to another reviewer mentioning the oven door not staying closed, you do have to push it hard to close it all the way but then it does stay closed. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase since my son is totaly in love with it and it is compact enough that we can keep it in the kitchen all the time without it getting in the way 
My one year old son loves to play with toy kitchens whenever he sees one, but I did not want to pay big $$ for a toy kitchen. I am so glad that I found this one. He is 13 months old and it is perfect for him. Very inexpensive but VERY cute and fun. He is not yet walking, so I just put it up against the wall. So far, it has not tipped over once. It is the perfect kitchen for him. He already pretends to cook and eat the play food that is included. My husband also liked the fact that it is not girlie in any way 
After surveying lots of kitchen sets, I decided to buy star kitchen for my kids(1.5 1.2 years old). It turned out to be a great choice. My kids love it, and I love it, too. 
This kitchen has everything the larger play kitchens have, but it takes up a third of the space. My daughter received this one for her second birthday and she enjoys cooking daddy breakfast with it almost every morning. When her friends come over to play, it is usually the first thing they go to -- even the older ones! I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to buy their child(ren) a small, but very functional kitchen 
I check every year for an updated version of this, hoping they will add an earphone jack. In my opinion, they just don't care. I bought this for my daughter to use. But the lack of earphone jack, a standard feature, in all but the most prehistoric electronic equipment, is a huge disappointment 
My five year-old daugther wanted this Barbie computer Christmas after receiving the younger Barbie computer for her 3rd birthday. She did not get it because it seemed expsensive but bought it herself with her Christmas money. She loved it from the start. She likes the games and the Spanish on it, too. She loved the mouse at first but then realized that it doesn't travel as well as the ones without a mouse (needs a solid surface versus using it in the car, airplane, drs office). The screen could be larger of course. She finds some games a challenge to figure out the rules and how-tos but overall loves her computer. She is very pleased with her purchase and I think she will be playing it for a couple years. The games are good for the ages 5-8 range 
My 6-year old daughter AND her friend got one of these for Christmas. THEY LOVE IT!!! It has tons of learning games and 5 levels on each game. I can't tell you how much this has helped her reading and writing skills. Once you complete a level, you get a "prize picture". I've been looking all over for the expansion cards because she noticed that they have a slot for them. I have had no luck. I would HIGHLY recommend this product 
I got this for my daughter who is 5 1/2 and she loves it. I think it maybe a little advanced for her but she has been doing the simple math and just loves the idea of using a computer that is only hers. I think she will grow into it. I have two other daughters too who are younger and have handled the laptop and it seems to be holding up just great 
My daughter has an earlier version that the one shown so it is possible they have addressed some of these issues: 1) most games have a 1 minute time out which is really frustrating for my kids 2) "Oh that's not so good" - If I hear Barbie say that one more time I may just throw this thing out the nearest window. My daughter will get a score in a game she feels really good about and barbie says, "Oh that's not so good, but you'll be better with a bit more practice" This has broken my daughter down into tears more than once. 3) There are no parental controls. I wanted to turn off or lengthen the timer. I expected those sorts of features from Oregon Scientific. Right now the most fun thing my kids do with it is play the Flower Fun game (like hangman) and type in "ICUP" If you are looking at a newer version of this I would strongly recommend playing with a demo for a few minutes to check it out 
Unless this product has undergone some major renovations, I would think twice about buying it. Here's what I think of last year's model... We got two Barbie B-Books for our daughters for Christmas last year and they have been quite disappointing. After thirty minutes of failed attempts on Christmas morning, our girls put them away and have hardly played with them since. The toy is rated in the 5-8 age range, but both my daughters (ages 5 and 7) have had trouble with them. I didn't expect the world for $50, but it certainly should have been better than this! The display screen is tiny and the dark gray text on light gray background is very hard to see, you have to get the angle exactly right. The graphics are choppy and look like they came from a program designed in the early 80's - all blocky and angular. The sound system is low grade and fuzzy, making it extremely difficult to understand Barbie's instructions. It's impossible to tell the difference when she says "X" and "S" or "V" and "T". Since the screens are so small, the text scrolls across rather than being displayed all at once. Even my seven-year-old (who is a great reader) had trouble keeping up with the scrolling text, and as for my Kindergartner, forget about it! The games are poorly explained and are too difficult for this age range. Even the basic spelling games are ridiculous because the level of difficulty jumps all over the place. In level one, I was asked to spell car, map, tar, and then suddenly cruise and caravan! Nonsense programming like this has caused my daughters much frustration and worse, has made them doubt their own intelligence. We don't even turn the B-Books on anymore. My girls have been able to get a little use out of them when they play office, pretending they're laptop computers. In all, these were an expensive disappointment and not worth the money 
My oldest daughter got the older version of this product for her 5th birthday. She could only play a couple of the games at the time, but she loved it. For three years now it has been her all-time favorite car toy. It has been dropped, banged, kicked, stepped on, fought over, and everything else two kids could do to it in 3 years, and still works great! Drawbacks: Pixter Leapster caught on that kids might actually want to play their toys past 5pm in the car put LCD lighting in, but this company hasn't caught on yet. Also, no headphones jack--some of the games make incredibly annoying noises! One more thing--the ages are not appropriately labeled. Closer to first grade and up 
I bought this set for my niece and nephew and they absolutely love it. The colors are great and the case makes it a cinch to store away. This set provides them with hours of fun. I recommend this to everyone 
I bought this for my 5 year old son who loves to draw. The crayons are cheap, compared to Crayola. We tested the 10 different reds searching for the correct "spiderman" red, but they all looked too pink, and pretty much the same color. Also really waxy. The oil crayons are terrible, totally waxy - no oil at all. Markers are OK (so far), but why provide two of each color with the same thin tip? They could have given a broad and thin tip marker in each color instead. The case does seem pretty sturdy, so worst case I'll replace the contents with better quality art supplies. I'm going to look around for something better... if I find it, this is going back to Toys R Us. Any ideas? 
I am the mother of two elementary aged children who love art projects. This was a Christmas gift and I was never so disappointed in the quality of this item. It arrived with crayons broken and the ones that weren't, you couldn't even use on paper. The markers are dry and caps don't stay on. This is a terrible product and the price is ridiculous!!! Definitely would be better off purchasing these items elsewhere!! 
I was not very pleased with this art kit. The caps to the markers do not stay on at all. The markers seemed dry almost from the beginning. The crayons and oil crayons are ok. And the wood case is very nice, but half the set is the markers and they look like they will dry out shortly. I was disappointed 
The case is a CHEAPLY made box of wood that did not even survive shipping. The materials contained inside are poor quality. The rating does not deserve one star. I returned it due to the damage sustained in shipping, but it would have been returned regardless because it is GARBAGE! 
My kids (6,5 and 3) all love this puzzle. We all enjoy the art work on the letters being different than the normal examples ( Y has yarn, N has nuts). My daughter just leaves this puzzle out on her shelf because she likes to look at it. My 6 year old still likes it because it is not as babyish as most alphabet puzzles. We have had this puzzle for 5 years and have had no problems with wear and tear issues 
In shopping for puzzles over the last few years I've noticed that the manufacture's age recommendations seem to be a bit off. When puzzles are too advanced, the simple solution is to put it up for a later date; however, when they are too simple, they're a waste of money. Unfortunately, the Alphabet Art Puzzle was one of those disappointments. The puzzle encourages thinking, and matching, but I'm not sure it helped to teach the alphabet. In addition, some of the images are too goofy for this age group. For instance, a piece of Rope is shaped into the letter "R," but a 3-year old don't associate with such a thing. Another example of this, is the letter "Y" for Yarn. Wouldn't a Yo Yo be a better solution? The raised pieces do offer a new motor challenge from plastic knobs, but they are too shallow for the board. I can't seem to move this puzzle without dropping several pieces on the floor. My son found this frustrating as well. What's more, I think the age recommendation needs to be adjusted. I purchased the Alphabet Art Puzzle when my son was 2-years and 4-months old. It's recommended for children 3-years and up, so I thought it would make a good choice. It didn't challenge him at all. The second time he worked it, he completed it in less than 4-minutes by himself. That said, my son has benefited from the puzzle. He likes working it, and continues to ask questions about the pictures. I recommend it for children 18-months and up, as they will find it more challenging than a 3-year old. 
This puzzle is one of my favorite gifts to give all the youngsters in my life. I've given it as a shower gift, a birthday present, and a Christmas present, and the kids have all loved it. It has held up very well, even with a few pretty destructive types. It's very visually engaging, and most kids can figure out what most of the pictures represent. Only a few are tricky. Overall, I highly recommend this puzzle 
My now 2 year old began playing with this puzzle (which was handed down from his old brother) when he was about 12 months old. By the time he was 15 months old, he knew all his letters! 
This puzzle is one of the best we have found for age 18m - 3.5 yrs. It is now being used by our second child and is in great condition, very sturdy wooden pieces. It is fabulous for learning all sorts of things - the alphabet, hand coordination, new words, and you can use it to play I Spy as well. It's visually appealing as well 
I must admit I am biased toward Lights, Camera, Interaction toys. My daughter has several of this line's toys and for the greater part we have been very pleased with the durability and educational factor of their products. The same goes for this alphabet puzzle. Even though the raised letters do not have pegs they are easily removed from the board. I like that the examples for the letters are not your general toddler "cat" and "balloon" icons, which broaden their understanding of the letters. I sing the "ABC" song to my daughter while I point to the letters and then practice pronouncing the words to the pictures and alphabet. A great hands-on way for little ones to learn the alphabet besides from the TV 
My 3 year old daughter loves art. She found this in a toy store and I did not want to buy it because it was a little pricey for art supplies. But she has really enjoyed this. It has a little bit of everything in it. She has used up almost everything in it. But she still uses it to organize her other arts and crafts stuff 
My daughter LOVED the color pencils and sketch pad that comes with this set. The crayons, however, did not survive the shipping, and those that did broke shortly afterwards with first use by my seven-year-old. Overall, a lovely kit, but crayons are not as well crafted as rest of the kit. 
I ordered this particular bunco set because the company's description said it was PINK! I received a very ugly cream and red set. 
The set is great and the rule book refreshed my memory. The Item did not come in the color shown. I wanted a pink one and I got a red and taupe set. Kind of disappointing 
The game of Bunco has been around since the late 1800's, when it was a popular parlor game among Victorian families. At some point, it spread through the mining and gambling communities in the still-wild West and became a popular way to lose lots of money quickly. The game of Bunco has remained popular among many people for all this time, and Fundex Games has now released a Bunco Party kit. The game comes with all the things you need to play Bunco, as well as cute invitations to invite people to your very own Bunco Party! Bunco is a great game for an afternoon with the girls, a family game night or an alternative to poker (or your other gambling game of choice). 
This game is for people to play if they're drunk or mindless...or in some cases both....it's completely pointless and uninteresting...if ur just going to play bunco to see if u can get 21 snake eyes you either love to waste time or are just stupid...sorry but i mean think about it?...why PAY MONEY for this when i can JUST USE DICE from OTHER MORE INTERESTING board games I already own? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! ~*Even if you manage to make the game interesting by being creative and thinking a little...you still shouldn't buy it...b/c like i said before JUST USE DICE FROM OTHER BOARD GAMES YOU ALREADY OWN! 
This is really fun for adults. We get together once a month and we really enjoy the company, the food and the spirits. This was meant for adults to solicize not for children. I am sure they might learn somehting at another gathering. I have really enjoyed Bunco. 
As the previous reviewer complained about this games simplicity, he has obviously never attended a BUNCO Party! This is a awesome game to play with a group of friends, it is easy, allows for conversation, and has become a craze across the USA!!! There are countless Bunco party's going on each week which allow moms and I am sure some dads a night out with friends neighbors for a little fun. This kit is great and has everything you'll need to host a BUNCO party! Get the wine chilling the appetizers ready for a fun party you and your friends will never forget!!! 
I played this game a bunch of times today. The game was pointless, slow, and boring. The only thing I liked was ringing the bell. The point of the game is to roll 21 ones, then twos, then threes, etc. How lame is that. I recommend you try Yatzee instead 
All our children love temporary tattoos. This one is special because you can color them yourself. We purchased this for my son's 7th birthday and it was a great birthday activity for all. Needless to say, I the rest of our guests were covered in art when the day was through. The tattoos stay fairly well if you don't get scrubbing them too hard are easy to put on, they don't stick and peel like some we've tried. They offer varied styles of tattoos, everything from dragons to sports. All in all this is great fun! 
I do wish there were a few more tatoos in this kit, but you can continue to use the markers and draw free hand tattos when they are gone. They were easy to apply and fun to color in for the kids. I was a little skeptical after reading a few of the reviews, but I am glad I decided to purchase this anyway. 
Tattoos are really nice, but the ink part (markers) wash off easily. The black tattoo outline seems to last several days 
Grandchild loved this gift. Her and her friends made tattoos for everyone. There were so many styles to choose from and they really lasted. Would buy again in a minute. 
My mom bought this set for my four year old son last week. At first I thought it might be a little advanced for him, but he got the hang of it in no time. Now he is tattooing the whole family. They are pretty easy to rub off, but that's probably a good thing, since he covered my daughter's face with flowers right after she got out of the bath! For the price, this is a great toy 
I bought this for our daughter and decided to open it, apply the stickers, and put the tools in a little travel bag before wrapping it up for Christmas. I'm very glad I did, because I'll have time to return it now and get her something else! 1. The end-door (yellow) will not stay closed. It falls out, it falls in. 2. The syringe looks cute until you pick it up. Because it gets wider at the back, the plunger will not stay in it - it just drops right out. Also, the hole which would normally be at the tip is placed on the side. ?! 3. The tools really do need a bag. If that were the only problem, I had the solution by using a small travel bag. 4. There is nothing to tell where the stickers go. I looked at the wrap-around packaging to figure it out, but had two stickers left over. I examined all of the toys themselves for clues, but ended up throwing the extra stickers away. 5. There is a little clipboard and an unsharpened pencil. The pencil does not stay in the clipboard's pencil "holder." Do NOT buy this set! Buy a stuffed animal and a regular play-doctor kit. You could even buy a real (small) pet cage at a pet store! 
Brought this item for my grandaughter, and she has totaly enjoyed it. It appears to be well made, and should last a long time. I believe it to be very educational as she pretends to be a veternarian 
Overall this is a nice toy. My daughter loves animals and if your child does this would be one they would enjoy playing with over and over again. It comes with everything you need to care for the puppy. The puppy is soft and very huggable. The only thing I would suggest is that it should come with a small bag to keep all the pieces in. My daughter ends up throwing all the pieces into the carrier with the dog in it and they jiggle and spill out sometimes when it's being carried around. It would also help to avoid losing those small pieces. Other than that, we love it 
My seven year old daughter says she wants to be a vet, so when we went to spend some birthday money, and she saw this, she fell in love with it. Some of the accessories don't look like any tool I've ever seen at a vet's office, but that hasn't stopped her from finding a use for them--she's really using her imagination with this one. No broken parts in our kit, and it's not getting the most gentle treatment, so maybe I got a new version or something. We also got the 13" (I think) Darby that comes separately, and she says it's the Mommy dog, and "Little Darby" is her baby, who's sick and has to see the vet 
We got this for my daughter for her 2nd birthday. She plays with it daily and love to pretend she's the doctor for Darby. She puts him to bed in his kennel everynight just like we do our real dog. Would highly recommend this toy 
I have trouble believing this is for small children. I tried to play this at a party with some friends. All of us who tried to play are in our 20s and 30s, and we couldn't figure out how the game was supposed to work. The DVD never makes it clear whose turn it is or what's really happening, and there are too many things added to the game from the original. I've played the regular, classic version of Clue many times and enjoy it, but this new version is frustrating, complicated, and not fun at all. I can't imagine that children would actually have fun with this when four adults couldn't even figure out what was going on 
After I saw the advertisement for Clue DVD I immediately went out to buy it. I've always been a fan of Clue and this updated version provides players with some new twists and excellent graphics. While you are playing the game, the Butler and an Inspector often appear to provide you with Clues about the case. Another addition to the game is added locations and having to figure the time of the crime. Any Clue fan will appreciate this version 
Excellent product! I really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve. After playing all 50, you can just start all over again! Fun, fun, fun game! THANKS 
This is an extremely fun and addictive game. You shuffle the cards, and place three (room, weapon, person) in the secret envelope. In every room you go into, you can make accusations. If someone has the card you accused (like the room), then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad. The game changes constantly, so it never gets boring. The character pieces have teeny details, like Mr. Green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. I gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really THINK. Oh, and good problem-solving skills too. And coordination (you have to add all the clues up to see who did it). All in all, a terrific game. Great for rainy days or playdates. And did I mention the weapons? Very realistic. And cute 
This was a little difficult to figure out in the beginning - Actually had to read the instructions - but it was very fun and very disney. Fam loves it 
My son received this game for Christmas and it is by far his favorite game. He enjoys pretending to be a detective and the game is easy enough for him to play and understand. I just have to figure out how to get more of the scoring sheets 
Okay, the original B-Wing was a little under-scaled and wasn't very accurate to the movie. Lego has gained alot of popularity over the years, alot more than before. Alot of people were asking for a new B-Wing because: 1.They weren't fans at that time to get it. 2.The B-Wing is just so cool. Here's my review: The B-Wing, well, just looks so NICE! I don't know why it is called a B-Wing, since it resembles a T more than anything else. Oh well, still a cool ship. You get two minifigures, a B-Wing pilot dressed in a nice looking red. And you get a Sullustan pilot named Ten Numb.(Yes Ten Numb is a real Star Wars character, he was dressed red in Return of the Jedi.) I think Ten Numb looks great. If you see his actual picture, I think you would agree. The B-Wing pilot has a classic smily face and what looks to be a racing helmet. Shweet! Two pilots and you only need one. The B-Wing is a masterpiece. Not only does it look more accurate than it's previous self, it is more accurate. The B-Wing itself is very sturdy. Two cons come with the B-Wing though. One of them is that the missiles shown do not fire properly. You must tilt the B-Wing to do so, which is very annoying. Another is those dreaded stickers. You never really can get them on right. Oh well, I don't even put the stickers on anyway. The B-Wing comes with a nice yellow and black service station with tools so you can display the B-Wing. I don't use it because in reality, the B-Wing lands horizontally.But it is still nice to have and can be used with other sets if you like. All in all, this B-Wing literally destroys the old. You get two pilots when you only need one. The price isn't that bad considering the pieces. I think that every fan should own at least one of these. I'm still trying to figure out the B shape though.. 
I have always loved B-Wings and have told myself that one day I would get one. These new releases caught my eye and so I spent my own money to get one. I was not disappointed. The B-Wing is AWESOME!!! It copies the design and features from the fighter in the movie very carefully, so it's a good-looking model Actually, the B-Wing in the movie is pretty ugly, and this copies the ship from the movie, but I've played enough video games to respect its firepower. I guess it doesn't look too bad. It's a nice Lego, but nothing is perfect. Here are the pros and cons. PROS: At a good 15 inches tall, this thing is MONSTER! It looks really neat The service tower is a nice thing to have for realistic play With the tower as a display stand, this thing looks cool in your bedroom For a huge fighter, it's actually easy to play with This thing would probably rock in the Star Wars ship battles kids like me have with its 7 guns. Not too hard to build CONS: Kind of expensive It doesn't break often, but when it does, it's tough to repair It's not too hard to build, but it does take a while It doesn't balance too well on the service tower/display stand because it's so heavy. Don't touch it though and you'll be fine The Ten Numb minifigure doesn't look too good in my opinion You have to open the S-foils manually. You think Lego would have the little gear-wheel to open it. Missiles have zip range, but Lego never really came through in the missile department anyway Engines look a bit tiny compared to the rest of the model The mechanic minifigure(whichever one you choose to use, I like to use the Ten Numb minifigure)doesn't have a lot of room to stand on The pilot minifigure is kind of hard to fit in Overall, most of the flaws are tiny and it's a really cool ship worth the $35 
This game is GREAT! You can really create your dream life with this fun toy. What you do is you first create your girl - pick her face, hair style, hair color, and first pair of clothes-, create her room, and make friends. You can also do chores for money, get a job if you want, and go SHOPPING!! There is school but it's only for a few seconds. If you do your homework and study and get good grades, your parents will allow you to get cool things such as YOUR OWN PHONE! You can go to school dances, have crushes, and create your own best friend! It is really fun and ADDICTING!!!!!!! Once you start, it is almost impossible to put it down. Like I said, this game is really fun and enjoyable. P.S. I read some reviews and saw that a lot of people are complaining about stuff like that the parents are giving too much money for chores and that the dances are dumb because you spend money for a dress and everyone just wears normal clothes. Well if you think about it, the game is called DREAM Life, meaning it's the life you dream about. Wouldn't you want your parents to give you a lot of money to do easy chores, or to have the nicest dress at the dance? So, you can't really deduct stars for that. hope i helpe 
I bought this game for my 11.5 year old daughter and she was not thrilled with it. She played it once or twice and was bored with it. It is not a good game if you want a toy your child will love 
We have enthusiastically played Candy Land with each of our three kids. It is easily the best starting point for introducing a child to board games. Players take turns drawing from a deck and moving their pieces around the board. The cards have one or two squares of a particular color (such as red, green, yellow, etc.) and players move pieces ahead on the path to the next matching spot of the same color. No counting or reading is required. There are also special cards that can move a player ahead or behind, and they are indicated by picture of the spot on the board to which the player should move their piece. Play continues until one player reaches the end. Some of my observations: 1) Most kids can probably start playing and enjoying this game before the recommended 36 months of age. If you have a child with the attention span and the desire to sit down for a 10-15 minute game, I'm pretty confident they could enjoy it. 2) Among the lessons our kids learned from CandyLand: taking turns, recognizing colors, and dealing with disappointment. Luckily, the games are quick enough that it is usually possible to play multiple games in one seting. This makes it possible to keep playing until each child has had at least one win. (Very helpful for managing little egos) 3) For such a simple game, it manages to perfectly balance the possibility of changes in fortune without seeming arbitrary. The game is literally in doubt until the last card is played (one of the "special" cards might send a player back to near the start). This is great for teaching that most valuable of lessons: "NEVER give up". 4) With most simple games, it is almost impossible to get older kids to play after they reach a certin age. We have not found that to be as true with Candy Land. We've had games with an adult and kids ages 3, 6, and 9 playing together and having fun. If you have more than one kid, you know how hard this can be. As a parent of three, I give this game my highest recommendation 
As a child, I myself grew up with Candyland. Now that I have children of my own, my house wouldn't be the same without it. We got this game when my son was 3 and my daughter was 2. Both of the kids understand the concept of the game and enjoy playing it. The best thing about this game is that there's nothing really complicated. The kids don't even have to know their colors to play. They just need to match up the color on the card with the color on the board. The game is simple enough that the kids often win which makes the game more enjoyable for them 
im 17, and this has been my favourite game since i was a baby. its so much fun, and it's soo simple, even the smallest of children can play. plus, now there are so many different versions of this game, that there are endless hours of fun and excitement! this game is a staple to every boy and girl, and is the perfect "first boardgame" to start the collection &lt;3&lt; 
My kids really enjoy playing the Candy Land DVD game. There are 3 different games to play and you can play for fun or play to win on each game. With kids running and bouncing around, I really like the fact that the mats pretty much stay put on the carpet. Unlike other games, the kids are not slipping and sliding or falling down on the mats. I believe this game is rated for ages 4 and up, but I think that most 2 and 3 year old kids could play most of the games if not all of the games. My son is 2 and he can play all of the games (we have to help him a bit of the 'Mister Mint says' game though) 
Fabulous kitchen which I purchased for my 2 year old grandaughter. I first saw it at a home recently sold by me. I was impressed by the quality and appearance. Upon speaking to other parents and discovering that their children used this "toy" at least until 9, I was inclined to spend the money. Needless to say, my grandaughter is thrilled. I have the kitchen in my home office and both her mother and I can feel free to use the computer while she is playing next to us 
I purchased this kitchen three weeks ago for my grandchildren. The instructions were great for assembly. Lots of storage space for all the kitchen food,dishes and small appliances. I have it set up in my kitchen and it fits in well with my decor. It has all the "bells whistles", that my 4 year old granddaughter and 18 month old grandson really seem to be enjoying. It takes up a good size spot in my kitchen but it's totally worth it to see the children having fun with it 
I gave this toy to my children for Christmas this year and they absolutely love it! They can entertain themselves for hours with this toy and I cannot say that about any other toy they own. It takes two people to put it together but it is pretty easy. My husband and I got it put together in about an hour. I recomend this kitchnen to anyone, it is well worth the money spent. They will get years of fun out of it 
I bought the deluxe version of this kitchen so there would be plenty of room for my 2 and 3.5 year old to use it at the same time. It is big but it's worth it! It was a Christmas present and they play with it daily. There's plenty of storage within the kitchen for play food and pots/pans and dishes although we use a back up box for the overflow. It comes in two big boxes but assembly was fairly straight forward. It took me 1.5 hours with a power screwdriver (I cannot imagine putting this together without one). A few minor issues: The description calls for 14 AA batteries. It actually used 12 AA batteries and the phone used 2 AAA batteries. Shipping is very expensive. I wish I had done more homework and either gotten a lower price or free shipping. A few of the screws were difficult to get in place because there was not enough room to use the power screwdriver (or any screwdriver) straight on. The screws for the battery plate on the phone are very small and one got stripped when trying to take the back plate off to insert batteries. I have not had any of the problems other reviewers have mentioned regarding doors not closing properly. Everything fits tightly and is aligned well. Overall I love the style of the kitchen. It's not garish like most play kitchens. Everyone get's a kick out of all the appliances and the working light over the sink. This is a toy that's full of details that are probably over my kids' heads at this time but will be appreciated more as they get older. Well worth the money and floor space! But forget having a quiet moment to read the newspaper. My kids find that the best time to cook something for me 
I have been eyeing this kitchen for two Christmas'. We knew this year we were definitely going to purchase a kitchen set for our 4 y/o, 2 y/o, and 10 month old. It was just a matter of finding one that was durable, had fun stuff, and options that were fun for all three kids. We wanted something that was big enough for two kids to play at, and something that would grow with our family. This kitchen has definitely met all my expectations. We purchased this directly from the manufacturer as they were offering free shipping until the end of last year. I took the advice of other reviewers and made sure to put the stickers on first. The Step 2 website has a great video demonstration for putting this together. An electric screwdriver is nice, but there are some tricky angles that might require a regular one. I would definitely expect to spend at least an hour putting it together. But just think, you only have to put it together once. I did it alone, but it would have been helpful to have an extra set of hands. The kids love this kitchen. Our 10 mo. old isn't old enough to truly understand cooking, but she loves to open and close the cabinets and oven, pull the drawers out, and put things in and out of the sink. Our 2 y/o has more of an imagination and enjoy actually pretend cooking. He understands it and loves all the space available. Our 4 y/o isn't really a "cooker", but he plays with this too. I like all the storage space this kitchen provides. The doors on the cabinets aren't all that sturdy, but they get the job done. They definitely aren't the quality of the countertops or main structure. There are sounds on the microwave, dishwasher, oven, phone, and stove. That said, the first three mentioned are basically the same "sound maker", just with different sounds coming out. The stove is neat, especially with the clear pots. I'm sure there are many other kitchens out there that have more of a "wow" factor as far as "lights and sounds". I am definitely pleased with this kitchen, and it was worth the wait. It does take up some space, but nothing I didn't measure out before we decided to purchase it. 
We bought this for our son who will turn 2 this month. He loves to cook and was always in my pans. He now has his own kithchen and loves all the sounds and different compartments. He is a very active boy and loves to climb and try to tear things up. I love step 2 because it is very durable and this kithchen is a great addition to our toys. Plus I love the neutral colors considering this was for a boy!! Highly recommend and was not that difficult to put together. Just do the stickers first and have 14 batteries ready!! 
We bought this kitchen set for our daughter for x-mas because we are stationed overseas we went through hell and back to get it at first we ordered it from Sears.com well they cancelled our order 2 days before x-mas I was heart broken cause I had bought all the accessories for the kicthen set and was looking foward to getting it for our daughter but then I looked online at Step2direct they have the kicthen for 199.00 and the are even offering free shipping it will take sometime to get here but I can't wait to see my child's reaction I know she will love it as much as I d 
This is a great kitchen!! Bought it for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas. Not really any problems putting it together. Cordless screwdriver makes putting it together much easier. [... 
This kitchen is fabulous!! I bought this for my daughters. We used this kitchen as a replacement for the SSC kitchen we had. I ordered this direct from Step2. It was 199.99 and free shipping. It was delivered very fast since their factory is very close to me. I have 7, 4 and 2 yr old girls. This was a HUGE hit with my 2 yr old. My 7 yr old is more into her gameboy and my 4 yr old loves the kitchen as well. This was very easy to assemble. The lables were very easy to apply. The acc. that come with this are very high quality. I am thinking of ordering more acc. from Step2. Dont waist your time looking at other kitchens. Spend the extra money and order this one. Step2 has the smaller lifestyle kithcen. It is just a step down from this one, but looks much smaller. I saw it at TRU. Once I saw that one I had made my decision to order the Deluxe kitchen. The other one didn't have the free ship anyway. Overall this kitchen is very high quality and the best on the market in my opinion. 
I read some of the other reviews about htis item and was nervous about getting it put together. Despite what I read, it was very simple. I did it all by myself and it was ready to play with in just 2 hours (That's counting putting on all of the decals). If you just set up your "work area" before you get started, it's simple. The decals weren't hard to get on with it being set up. I think this is a great toy to have. My daughter is 4 nd a half and she absolutely loves it. I would recomend this toy to everyone with kids. I am very pleased with my purchase and know this toy is well worth the $199 I spent. I ordered it directly from Step 2 and they had it delivered to me on Christmas Eve.....just in the nick of time!! 
My kids are used to playing games on a computer so the screen was very disappointing. It is very poor quality, but perhaps that is why it is so inexpensive. I wish I had taken the advice of some other viewers and gone to a store to see it in person. I will be trying to sell mine again 
I am expecting to give a 5 star review. I have not used this product yet. I just purchased it for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She has been telling me that she wants the Easter Bunny to bring her a computer. Mommy works on a laptop all day and she is so interested in using my keyboard. I thought this looked like a real laptop and it should interest her as much as mine does. I have originally thought that this would be too advanced for her (ages 5 and up listed on my box), but after reading a few of the reviews it might just be the right challege that she needs. Mom in Michiga 
I bought this for my grandson's 6th birthday along with the case. He started using it immediately and thinks it is just like Mom's and Grandma's laptops--mouse and all! But this is kid-sturdy and educational. He loves it. 
I purchased this activity notebook for my granddaughter who has scheduled a thirty minute session each night after dinner. It was her request, by the way. I like the fact that it tracks progress and has levels of difficulty that will keep her attention for years to come. As a bonus, her little brother can use it as well when he is old enough. I predict its usefulness in their household for at least the next twelve years. Its the best gift I've ever purchased for a child 
I bought this as a gift for my grandson. He was so excited when he opened it. And, after we got it going, I was really surprised at how much it did. We're really pleased with this product. 
I just bought a Nitro Notebook for my 5 year old son, and it's been a great success. He has really improved his reading,writing, and number skills in just three weeks. I will certainly buy the next level laptop for him when the time comes. Father, Dom.Rep 
We bought the game thinking it would be just like the real life game, but with sponge Bob characters. It is a very simplified version of the game. It is geared towards young children. In the game, if you run out of money, you just keep playing, and you are exempt from having to pay any fees, while the people with money, still keep paying...so you are actually better off if you lose your money early in the game. (that bugs me) as far as the spinner goes...it snaps on, you have to press hard to get it to click into place, and it works great. Just a little disappointed, just remember, it's for little kids. If you love the game of life, get the original one...my older kids want me to buy the original one, they don't care for the sponge bob version. 
I don't think the original edition of the Game of Life was meant for grade-school age children. Re-vamping the board with familiar Sponge Bob, Squidward, Mr. Crabs and Patrick makes it an inviting game! Visually, the game board looks great. There are slots on the board to insert the Crusty Crab, The Chum Bucket, Sponge Bob's house, etc. The game is a lot of fun and my kids enjoyed it so much. I even enjoyed playing it with them. My only complaint is with the spinner. It is a great looking two-part spinner but when you spin it you have to hold it down. Otherwise it will come apart and/ or come off the board. 
I got this for my almost 5 and 6 yr olds who are big-time Spongebob fans. This game is absolutely adorable and loads of fun for our whole family! The board is an outrageously colorful and fun representation of Bikini Bottom. There are 3-D buildings of Patrick's, Squidward's, Spongebob's houses, The Krusty Crab, The Chum Bucket, Mrs. Puff's Boating School, The Anchor, The Shady Shoals Rest Home. The pawns are delightful and substantial 3-D plastic renditions of Spongebob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs that ALWAYS stay standing on their adequate base!! I can't stand those cheapo cardboard pawns with the tiny stands!!! There is no accumulation of children in this game version, but one does decide on whether to attend college or not (and pick a corresponding career), adopt a pet, and chose a home. There are life tiles($100 each)to earn for doing decent things and expenses to pay for unfortunate or typical Bikini Bottom life events. There are also Raffle cards to help earn extra money by game of chance spins. The writing on all of the cards is witty and humorous. I won't spill the beans about the pets, careers, homes, expenses, life cards or raffle cards because they are just so cute and funny!! My kids think the cards are a riot! The winner is determined once every player has reached Shady Shoals rest home by greatest net worth. The game moves along at just the right pace and my kids had no problem learning the rules. It is a great teacher of reading and money counting ($1,000's $100's only)as well as decision making and consequences of behavior. Game play really does even out any skill level because much of the game is chance based by the numerical spinner to make your move. I paid full price for this game and I think it is well worth every penny! A++++++, FABULOUS GAME!!!!!! 
My daughter loved it for her birthday. It is really cute 
A varry good board game.I played it for the first time over the weekend.Another game we like is strippopoly 5 stars for them bot 
If you and your friends are just too crazy for conventional board games, give I've Never - The Game of Truth a try. The object of the game is simple, players move around the board answering highly personal and potentially defamatory questions, and take shots or drink beer while playing. The questions are formatted as "I've Never...." (for example, "I've never been skinny-dipping"). If this is true for you, you get to move forward the designated number of spaces. If it's false, you pay the consequence (generally you must take a drink). Some spaces on the game board automatically force you to drink. Many people will find the questions far too offensive and overly personal, and will be uncomfortable playing this game. If this is you, don't feel bad, you're not the only one. However, in a group of close friends, this game can be a total laugh riot. This game is perfect for a Bachelor or Bachelorette party, or just a regular party with a group of friends who are as crazy as you are 
This is the most hilarious board game you could ever play! It's great at your next party, family gathering, or get together with close friends. I was completely entertained and enthralled with the secrets that were revealed about some of the people closest to me. I learned things about my brother-in-law, for instance, that I just never would have believed! What a nut! Just a fun, amusing, down to earth game to play; I've played it numerous times, both with people who have played before, and newcomers, and it only get's better each time. And of course, it incorporates drinking in a way that only makes it more enjoyable. The secrets really start coming out only after a few turns. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good board game and a lot of laughs 
The first time I played this game was with my co-workers at Happy Hour and then again with my family members on our summer vacation at the beach house. Although we were already close and "thought" we knew a lot about each other-this game only made us closer. I don't remember laughing as hard as I did once secrets started to become revealed. The next morning at breakfast, no one could even make eye contact without laughing! This game is perfect to play with a group of friends or family and will keep you laughing all the way thru! It would make a perfect holiday gift-I highly recommend purchasing this game if you are up for some laughs! 
Hey, I just wanted to write in a review for this game because I loved it so much. I just ordered it less than a week ago, and it is already here, no problems, with a great price for an unbelievable game. The game consists of 100 I've Never cards (10 which you make up on your own) and each one is more hilarious than the next. I played with a bunch of my college friends and was drunk before I even rolled the dice (the way we all want it to be). Looking for a great game to play and learn all the unspoken truth of your friends, then definately test out this game, I highly reccomend this 
[...] My sister and I thought we would be able to Instant message using these across the neighborhood. So we split up, loading the "chips". To our displeasure, we had to walk all the way back, switch "chips" and put them in. This is not a very good toy. First, you have to annoyingly scroll through each letter. For example, to type in a y, you have to press the select button 25 times and enter it, so messages take AT LEAST 5 minutes. Then you have to physically HAND these little chips to your friends. It would be 100x easier just to talk to them. There are a ton of little gadgets like these, but this has to be one of the worst. You are better off just talking or buying another toy of this nature, as nobody wants to walk, switch "chips" and walk away. 
We have had this toy with both our daughters. My 3yr old still enjoys playing with it, but because it is so low to the ground my baby (almost a year) is the one that really loves it. My first daughter loved it just as much when she was about that age also. We like the shapes and the basic pots and open and closing of the doors and such. It is difficult to put things in the fridge and have them stay, but that isn't such a big deal because they play in all the other compartments. By the time my oldest was two she was ready for a bigger kitchen, but it is great entertainment for the younger! 
My daughter LOVED this kitchen from about 9 mos. till about 13 mos., then she lost interest. She used to dance to the sounds that it makes (which to me are fun and not irritating, like other toys). It did sometimes go off on its own...usually if a door slammed or even thunder. We would just turn it off at night. This toy was by far my baby's favorite and it held her interest much longer than any other toy. Its a great size for a busy crawler/new walker and it has enough things to open/press/drop for the 7-12 mos. set. Though the 2 and 3 year-olds who come over have fun with it too! I recommend this for babies younger than one year, though he/she may have fun with it longer than that 
My daughter loves to open and close the microwave, refridgerator door, and oven door. She also likes the sounds this makes. My older daughter had a different model about 5 years ago which she just adored. Both seem really good, although the prior one was a bit better...the door was sturdier and it came with shapes that were "ice cubes" - they would put them in the shape sorter door, then push a button and they would come out. This one, you just place the food shapes in the slots and they fall out. Also, there was a slot for the phone...this model it just comes with the phone, with no real "place" for it. ANYWAYS, all in all, this one is good and she enjoys it (just turned 1). Definitely good buy for 9mos+ 
I don't know why some reviewers are complaining about the size of this-just read the description. We bought this for my 8 month old and she loves it. It is the first toy she goes to every morning. It is the perfect size for her and she loves opening and closing all the doors. I think it makes an ideal first kitchen 
My little girl loves this toy! It's perfect for a 1-year old. It makes sounds, has a shape sorter, and has doors to open and close. I also recommend the set of accessories that go with it 
My 17 month old enjoys playing with this kitchen, mimicking Mommy. However, in the past few months she has REALLY shown an interest in kitchen playsets for 2+ that are for the child to stand at while using. She doesn't go to this kitchen as often as she used to. For her, this toy seemed to be at it's prime for about 3 months (12-15 months of age) and now she has moved on to the next level of play. It is a cute toy that introduces toddlers to kitchen "ideas", but it either needs more intrigue or a younger age to start. I think that when she was 9 months old or even just sitting up she would have had fun playing with parts of it-opening the refrigerator/microwave/or oven, hitting the stove to make the music play or turning the "water" in the sink to make the music play. She may have had more trouble with the shape sorter then, but I think toys are good to grow into. I do not recommend this as a 12-month toy. Wait a few months and buy one for 2+ 
The Sudoku board game allows players to compete in a multiplayer Sudoku game. Each player/team gets assigned a game board (mild, hot, or spicy) and races to see who can complete the puzzle first. The game includes two boards, two number sets, and one set of game cards. This game is very enjoyable and entertaining. Another neat feature is one player can use this game alone. Since the boards do not require a game card to work, the number of games is un-limited and can come from many different sources (books, magazines, website, etc), which requires you to place the given numbers yourself. This has provided us a great way to play Sudoku without the pencil and will continue to provide another way to enjoy Sudoku 
This wasn't actually a card game. It was more of a book of 88 tear out sheets with one game each. They is no way that this can be played as a card game. The box doesn't even indicate that it's a card game. I thought this would be a fun card game for my husband daughter to play together. You can purchase magazines with more games for less price. I wouldn't recommend this product unless you would like an overpriced book of sudoku games. I'm returning it buying an electronic version for husbands PDA. The price is about the same. 
My daughter got this as a gift for her 2nd birthday. Not only does she love putting the puzzles together - and double the fun being two-sided - her 4 yr old sister also enjoys it. It is useful to teach more complex concepts to our 4 yr old, such as 2 triangles make a square, 4 triangles make a rectangle. Both girls really enjoy this toy, as with all Melissa and Doug toys, it is very well made and will withstand abuse. Just wish it was easier to fit the plastic cover on, we can't seem to fit the shapes neatly to close easily, especially in a hurry. A minute inconvenience. A great toy 
I bought this for my three year old godson last Thanksgiving, and he loved it. The pieces are bright, sturdy, and easy to grasp with tiny hands. I've purchased several Melissa and Doug products, and I've never been disappointed 
We loved this set. It is great for very young kids and they like it. However, the time between learning the principle and getting bored because it became too easy, was very short. About 2 months ago we bought Snappers by Toysie - a pattern block puzzle. My children (with 3 years apart!) both still play with it. It seems like my youngest child will be using it for the next 3 years. That is the lifespan for a toy 
My son love this toy. It also reenforces this shapes and colors. it's a stepping stone for geometric patterns 
We bought this for our son as a Christmas present. As he was not quite two yet, I thought he might not totally get the concept and that this would be a toy I could put up for later. Boy was I wrong. He loves this puzzle set. I find he plays with it longer and gets less frustrated if I first let him pick out which picture he wants to "build" and then take the necessary shapes out and place them next to him. He is very proud of himself once he gets the pieces in then he'll give himself a big round of applause(which mommy and daddy do also). Great self-esteem builder and fun way to teach shapes 
Our two children (12 months and 23 months) just love this set. The boards and pieces are very sturdy. We like that the boards are two sided. Good variety and amount of shapes. This is a classic toy that will last for years- we see it as one that we will keep even after our children have grown out of it- great to keep around for visiting kids 
This item is a must have! My two year old chooses it over just about anything else. I always seek out Melissa and Doug toys because of their quality and educational value and this one is one of mine and my daughter's favorites 
This is a brightly-colored, sturdy pattern block set. I would give this set to a child between 20 months and 3 years. My 22-month old just loves it. As soon as he saw it (hidden away, intended as a Christmas gift) he kept at me to open it. I finally gave in, and I am so glad that I did. He is at the perfect developmental level for this toy! He tries to match up the shapes and colors, and is even starting to name the shapes on his own. This is such an exciting age! I like how the solid wooden boards are double-sided and VERY sturdy. There are more than enough pieces to go around- even if a few are lost over the years. A few of the pictures arrived with some scratching, but I think this is more annoying for me than it is for my child. Don't forget that these patterning blocks can also be used independantly of the boards. This enables your child to come up with more challenging creations as she or he developes greater skill in this area 
My son is 21m and he absolutely loves this puzzle. Whenever he catches me putting it away, he immediately takes it apart and plays with it again. It's not challenging enough for my 3yo. She'll play with it for a few minutes and gets bored, but my son loves putting the shapes in over and over. A great toy for rainy days 
My soon to be 2 year old son is obsessed with shapes and had outgrown the basic shape puzzle (the large knob puzzle by melissa and doug) and I was looking for a puzzle that went beyond that but was not too difficult. I was thrilled to find this! It looks and feels great too. My son really enjoys it and I think it is conceptually very well put together. Not only are the puzzles well within his reach but he also enjoys free play with the shapes. He recently discovered that 2 triangles can make a square and two rectangles can make a square too :) That was only possible because the shapes are thoughtfully proportioned as such. I do agree with the other viewer who said that this puzzle is not for a 5 year old. My son is not yet 2 and he can do them. If it wasn't for the sharp edges of the shapes I would say its for 18+ months - 3 years 
Back in January of 2006, I purchased the "Rock-N-Fold" Chair for my son. He absolutely loves it! Not only does he play his video games in it, he also does his homework in it as well! This product is the best ever 
My sons love the rock fold chair. They use it when their friends come over and they play games for a long time. They watch TV and rock and love the chair. I love the fact that is folds and i can just store it in the closet and have room to play. Thank you this product is a great space saver and great for kids 
it really is a fun toy that helps you stay fit and will make you laugh 
This is a wonderful wood puzzle for the toddler who finds the baby wood puzzles too easy but who doesn't quite have the dexterity (or patience) to fit together classic puzzle shaped pieces. Because it is all wood, it can stand up to the wear and tear of a toddler. My son (20 months) found this hard at first, but was thrilled to have the challenge and would not stop working on it for days until he could do it easily. The picture is underneath the pieces. The is one of my son's very favorite toys of all time! He also loves the school bus one that is similar by the same company 
A definite must for the firetruck lover in your family. This keeps my toddler busy for quite awhile and he even talks to it! Very, very cute and durable too - it takes quite a slamming and hasn't even chipped 
This puzzle is my son's favorite. A great gift for a boy who enjoys puzzles and fire trucks 
I bought this for my 5 year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it. Within a few days of careful use, one of the latches bent, a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued. It is a great idea, but needs better construction. On a positive note, my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if I let her. However, I had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before I can fix it. The drawers work fine. The problem is with the two doors on top that flip out. Note about drawers; Little plastic door knobs pop out. Need to be glued in. 
over all a good gift for children but I feel that maybe you could have added few peices of paper. Thank 
Our son received this as a gift, and we sent it back. The box is made of inferior wood, and very poorly constructed. Not really "constructed" at all - rather just glued together, and not well, at that. Two of the corners were coming apart. Also, the lid opens in two parts. The drawback: when you open or close either side, the plastic trays on the inside that hold the crayons and pastels, fall out, as there is nothing securing them to the box. So, you have to try to hold the tray in place while closing either side. We can't comment on the supplies themselves, as we did not allow our son to try them, or else he would not have been able to return the item. 
I loved Electronic Talking Battleship as a kid in the 1980's and have been anxious recently to play this game again. I was always excited looking through the back of the play booklet when picking out a board. I was also always nervous when the opposing player would hit the red button, firing their missile. You hope they'll miss but you'll get a bit nervous once they manage to hit one of your ships. You also hope they won't sink all your ships before you can figure out where their ships are. On the other hand, when you're the one pressing the red button, you're eager to hear that crashing sound - hitting one of your opponent's ships. A good feature of this game is that you can play someone or you can play against the computer. When someone plays against the computer, one usually loses. But I recall as a kid beating the computer a few times so that's not the case here. In all, Electronic Talking Battleship is worth the money and will bring many hours of entertainment. A great investment! - Donna Di Giacom 
I bought this for my 8 year old. Although it took an adult to read, understand and then teach the rules of play, once we got the basic (classic) game figured out, it was easy. There is an advance game too, but it is too complicated for us. We enjoyed it a lot, and it makes you plan and do some thinking, as to where to put your ships. My son always wants MORE MORE MORE when it comes to Battleship. The game talks, and it closes up with a carrying handle. That makes it more money than the other versions, but it is well-made and worth the price 
This was a Christmas purchase in our house this year and we have found the game to be incredibly fun from the familiar classic level to the very strategious advanced level. The one drawback that we have found is the annoying fact that the pegs do not fit well in the vertical grid board and are always falling out, or in the case of the planes are sometimes impossible to get out without the pliers that we keep handy when we play. There are four holes on the grid that are part of the support pegs and these holes will not hold a peg for anything. This really detracts from an otherwise superb game 
Among the classic board games that has become a part of American culture. A child is not a child unless he or she has played battleship. A training in search patterns and comprehension of results that are returned to you. Can you create a more effective and efficient search pattern then your peer. Can you create a ship target pattern that is harder to detect based on the strategy your peer uses. A great game 
If you enjoyed the traditional Battleship game, you'll really love this game. My only complaint is that the voice announcements can be a bit garbled at times. There is a repeat option to hear them again, and we have used that one! Overall, a lot of fun 
This puzzle is great, and I'm glad I bought it for my 2 year old, Claire. However, like most toddlers, she prefers things that are HER size. I find that the hands in this puzzle are slim adult sized hands, like my own. Maybe the makers felt "Mommy" sized hands were the way to go, or simply that they wanted to fill the space in a standard sized wooden puzzle. I think it would have been nice to make the hands toddler sized, with chubby palms and fingers. That said, it's a great tool. We don't use it much for counting, though that is it's intent. This is more of a prop for the song fest of "Where is Thumbkin" and an even more exciting prop for the game of "Dr. Claire" wherein she repairs the "owie hand". All in all, a fine addition to your wooden puzzle collection 
Our little girl absolutely loves puzzles, and this one presented a real challenge. The pieces are somewhat irregular, left from right, which allows for growth in her problem-solving abilities. I bought this when she was 22 months, and she has been able to master it quickly. Not only do the pegged pieces help define fine motor skills, but the numbers, colors, and left/right make this a multi-dimensional learning tool. She's 24 months now, and has most colors down as well as learning to count. The colors were really helpful, because being the neurotic parent, I was beginning to wonder if she had some colorblindness because she wasn't recognizing colors at first. But silly me, I forgot she was a toddler. So much for my fears of why she isn't solving quadratic equations. 
My kids love this puzzle. It's in my pediatrician's office, and they run to it every time. My son, now 4, has been interested in it since he was 2, and my 2 year old is now fascinated by it as well. 
Little hands do well with the two hands on this puzzle. The bright, colorful art and images have thrilled my children. It is well made and sturdy. My children think of this as a "big kids" puzzle since it isn't farm or baby animals. It makes them proud when they put it together 
Definitely a must buy!!!! My two year old learned her right hand from her left hand by using this puzzle. Not only does she understand the concept of counting from 1 to 10, but she also understands that each finger on each hand is different from the other. This puzzle teaches spacial concepts, counting, colors, and coordination. I wish there were more puzzles like this one. If anyone knows of any, please contact me through Amazon. chrische 
My little boy loves puzzles, and this is probably his favorite one. And I like that it's so sturdy and will be able to be passed down to his sister 
My little girl received this puzzle along with two other ones on her second birthday. I thought it would be a little too advanced for her but it turned out to be her favorite one! She showed me that with persistence little hands can achieve great things. She is two and half now and she still loves this puzzle, whether it is to count the objects on each finger or to learn the names of the fingers it keeps her busy each time she picks it up. 
This puzzle has been through two kids in my house and it's still in great shape. The cardboard is thick and durable. The picture is friendly and interesting. It's been a favorite with my kids. However, if you are buying this puzzle for a two-year old or younger, this puzzle can be very cumbersome to solve simply because the pieces are gigantic. As a small child solves the puzzle, he must basically crawl over it to reach the other parts and that causes the pieces to come apart. The floor puzzles like this one have caused some aggravation with my kids simply because they can't avoid getting on the puzzle to reach sections and that undoes their work. We have found smaller sized pieces to be easier to solve, as long as the fine motor skills allow. Just something to keep in mind.. 
Both of my boys love Thomas. I really scored when I found this Thomas puzzle. The puzzles is built to take the abuse of a 2 4 yr. The box that it comes in, is a bit of pain to get all the tabs undone to get to the puzzle. Cute box, but a pain. M.G 
My 3 year old likes this puzzle (she loves the Thomas character) and really enjoys doing this one. The color is bright and the picture is interesting. This one is a great starter for kids learning how to work with puzzles. I gave 4 out of 5 only because this one isnt as challenging as some other 24 piece puzzles... though that doesnt seem to deter my youngster, who puts it together daily 
My 2 1/2 yo received this puzzle for Christmas. He is a big Thomas fan, so the subject matter was perfect. The pieces are quite large - I'd estimate 4 inches by 4 inches, and are well-made. The graphics are colorful and accurate - the puzzle depicts Thomas, Percy, James, Cranky Harold. My son asks to put the puzzle together over and over. He can now do most of it by himself just by putting together one engine at a time. The fact that the pieces fit together easily and are large make it less frutrating for him. I'd highly recommend this puzzle for any Thomas fan 
This is such a cute puzzle and your Thomas the Train fan will love it. It comes in a Thomas the Train-shaped box and the pieces are large enough for a toddler to grab and fit together. My son is 2 1/2 and he loves this puzzle and can put most of it together by himself. I highly recommend it 
our son loves the puzzle, the only negative thing that we would like to add, is that when we opened the box, on of the pieces had a piece of glue stuck to it, and unfortunately separating the pieces torn the puzzle piece, which my son notices. he does not like to see (something broken - as he says), apart from that the puzzle has had a lot of use. 
I bought this kitchen for my 18 mos. old and she really enjoys cooking and working in it. It is a nice, compact size that doesn't take up too much space. She can work at all the different stations and not get frustrated. Another bonus for me was that it came fully assembled and ready to use straight out of the box. My only complaint would be that the doors are somewhat difficult for my daugter to open, but I know as she gets older, it will become easier. I would definitely recommend this kitchen to anyone who in interested in purchasing one for their child 
I love Step 2 products as they area well-made, easy to assemble (though the kitchen didn't require any), and well thought out. This has a great telephone that rings, the look is cute, and it fit's nicely in the corner of my son's room. Now he can be a Top Chef all day long. 
My twin daughters got one of these kitchens for Christmas! They love this kitchen. It is not as tall as some of the others on the market which is a feature that I love!! My girls play with this all of the time and it is small enough that I have it set up in the kitchen so that they can pretend that they are cooking while I make dinner. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a kitchen for a toddler. IT is well built and stays clean 
My daughter received this for Christmas when she was 20 months. She loves it!!!!!! It is the perfect size for her and she is now a tall 2 year old. It is conveniently one piece and very durable. Easy to clean.You will need to buy some food and pots and pans as it does not come with any. Highly recommend for any little tot 
I got this toy 3 years ago when my oldest was [...] now she is almost [...] and still plays with it all the time but now she shares it with her [...] sister who also loves it as well. no fancy gadgets or lots of lights but it lets the imagination run wild 
I purchased this item for my 2 year old toddler. She loves playing in the kitchen while I prepare meals. She's able to manipulate and open all the compartments with ease. This was a great buy 
I bought this gift for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She really loves this kitchen. Abby Reese spends hours and hours cooking up a storm with this fridge. She is so imaginitive - I love how it teaches her pretend play. This kitchen is very compact - fits almost anywhere. I'd recommend this kitchen to anyone 
This kitchen is not the first one I've purchased. I am more happy with this one than the other two I have purchased. It has plenty of storage space for all the food and gives the child more doors to open and be more creative. I am very happy with this kitchen, it's durable and a good buy 
My daughter got this kitchen for her second B'day. She loves it, I have watched her imagination grow as she pretends to cook. She even uses the different compartments to hide treasures. It is very sturdy and well made. Loved that it came completely assembled. I highly reccomend this kitchen. Only wished it had come with some pots or food 
Very pleased with this purchase... My 2 yr. old daughter loves playing with her new kitchen! The kitchen came fully assembled and all plastic parts are very sturdy. The telephone is fun - and is actually my daughter's favorite part of the whole kitchen! I know of 4 other friends who have this same kitchen - and all are pleased with their purchase 
My kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with Renaissance paintings. They've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them. I realize this is not the typical situation. I was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck. It is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid's knowledge. I had hoped for a game like "Famous Authors" which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players. Nonetheless, the game is well presented. It's on the expensive side, but the book alone is worth half the price. Looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones? I recommend this 
I purchased this book when we took the kids (10, 8 and 8) to visit the Louvre this summer so they would have some idea why we were wandering around that vast building. Little did I know that it would spark an interest in my 8 year old son that borders on the obsessive. He has read the book two dozen times, spouts off all kinds of interesting facts about the artists and the times, and studies the paintings intently (this from a kid who has no artistic talent at all and whose favorite pasttime is sparring with his brother). The stories behind the paintings, the odd facts about the artists and the practices of the Renaissance period, are all presented in a compelling way with beautiful illustrations to boot. I recommend this highly readable and entertaining book 
I received this game as a gift and it really is a great! The book that comes with it would have been a perfect 'Cliff Notes' for the Art History classes I had in school. My eight-year-old daughter won the first game we played and I'm re-learning lots of stuff I had forgotten. Highly recommended 
Wow! My kids(8yo and 5yo)love to play this game~ They really enjoy this version of Go Fish~ We have all been enjoying the thrill of recognition when we see these artist's works in other places~ Well worth the money 
My son is three yrs old and about 42 inches, we keep it on the next to last highest setting and it is enjoyable for him We will probably need to put it on the highest setting soon and probably need a bigger one next summer. He has alot of fun with it and although it is not very tall or does not have the ability to go as tall as some other models, he still has fun trying to aim and shoot for the hoop so we will use it to practice these skills before buying another. You definitely need to fill the base with sand before using( do not use water as substitue) as it will tip over repeatedly without sand as per the directions. Overall just like any basketball set this one provides great outdoor/indoor fun as well as exercise and is durable compared to others in its price point. We have not had problems with the height adjustment bar or with any parts falling off and my son is rough with this toy and b/c I did not fill with sand right away it has fallen numerous time and seems to be wearing well. So I think it is a great deal for the price 
This basketball goal is great, its a great height for little ones and provides hours of fun! The best thing is, its a classic toy that requires no batteries, and several kids can play at the same time 
My husband and I bought this for our son for his second birthday and he LOVES it. We set it up as soon as he unwrapped it and he played with it for an hour straight, stopping only because it was bed time. He even passed up cake so he could continue playing. The ball is the perfect size and the height adjustment will be very useful as his skills improve. He can easily play by himself, as most shots that go through the hoop are returned to him. Warning: temper tantrum might ensue when it is time to stop playing 
I got this for my son when he was about 18 months. He is now ten and we still have it indoors. It has provided all three of my boys and their friends with entertainment. Simple and durable. I'm getting one for my nephew who's 2 
I bought this hoop for my 14mth. old and he loves it!! He made a shot the first try and this hoop has kept him busy for a long time. I keep it in our basement for indoor play and it's sturdy and durable! I can't honestly say who enjoys playing "hoops" (as we call it at our house) more, him or me 
I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because I want her introduced to all sports; whether she chooses to go with a specific one years from now it all up to her, but I am doing my part. I cannot speak highly enough about this basketball set. It's GREAT! Even adults can join in with kids in playing with this! I have read more than one review saying that the rim/hoop keeps falling out... my suggestion is MAKE SURE IT'S IN ALL THE WAY! You will hear a click letting you know it's securely in, not to mention you can tell by looking at the back of it. It should be flush against the backboard. I hope that those few reviews won't hinder another parent's choice in purchasing this wonderful and family friendly toy! I give it 5 stars all the way 
I did A LOT of research on the Internet regarding play food before I bought this set. This set offers the largest variety of foods, covering all of the food groups, with minimal amount of desserts (I want a healthy eater). This play food set has eggplant, cauliflower, asparagus, chicken, steak, ham, hot dogs, hamburger, bacon, pineapple, lemon, honeydew and musk melons, any many more items - an incredible selection of foods. I received exactly what was shown in the picture on the Internet. The food is very high quality and just the right size for a play kitchen to fit on the play plates. My daughter, husband and I have a great time with this food. She loves making us breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. She also likes to put it in her shopping cart that we had purchased separately and ring the food up with a pretend cash register. As for comments on the packaging...packaging costs money which is built into the cost of the food. That is why this food doesn't cost a lot, because Step 2 saves money on packaging. Plus most people toss packaging anyways after opening an item. The packaging is clear plastic so you can see all of the items. This set has a larger variety of food than Little Tikes, Fisher Price, and Just Like Home (I never saw anything about Kid Connection play food during my research). The person who received 8 hot dogs, 12 french fries, etc. should contact Step 2 and ask for a reship. There must have been a mistake made when packaging was done (probably a rush for holidays orders). You should get exactly what is shown on the Internet. I hope this review helps everyone. Have fun with this food! It is a GREAT buy!! 
I agree with a previous review that you get what you pay for. But in the future I would highly recommend paying more once instead of having to replace this food in a few months or so. We received this as a gift and from the outside it looked like an great choice! I was very happy. But we have had this package of food for about one week and I am already taping boxes with packaging tape to keep them together. Little hands can pull apart the milk, juice and snack boxes in no time. The cans of food are so small that they topple over easily in the play kitchen. The pies, pizza, and such food are all actually hollow underneath. There is no base to them. They tell you 101 pieces but in our kit it counted 8 hotdogs (without buns), 12 individual french fries and the same on potato chips. Not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets in a french fry container and you get a hot dog in a bun separately. Why would my child want four jalepenos too. So much of this food is not they type of thing a small child would be familiar with. Anyway, in my opinion spend the money on a smaller quantity of higher quality food or go online and find the "vintage" Fisher Price or Little Tikes food. Now those are made to last and of good size for small hands. 
I love step2 products, my daughter is only 2 yrs old but we already have MANY of their items. We decided to get her the lifestyle deluxe kitchen for the holidays this year needed to get her some playfood to go along with it, I really wanted wooden sets but after spending over $200 on the kitchen I decided I'd go with the step2 plastic... big mistake! As another reviewer mentioned there is no retail packaging, they come in plastic bags. The plastic pieces are tiny, very thin, and sized strangely (ie a banana is smaller then an egg etc), the "boxes" are a joke, they are smaller and weaker then your typical snack size raisin box... I didn't even dare give them to my toddler as they'd have been ruined in 2 seconds. The "jars" are also very small and instead of interesting as one reviewer said they are just odd, disgusting sounding food items and very boring design. Having nothing else on hand I did give these to my daughter, she seems to like them well enough but I will be buying her some wooden playfoods soon and tossing these up on ebay or a garage sale. Not recommended 
If you are looking for play food that is like little tikes or fisher price, this is not it!! There is a reason you get 101 pieces for 19.99!! These pieces are much smaller and made from a thinner cheaper plastic. Not at all what i expected from a quality company like step 2. To top it off, this set does NOT come in a retail box but is cheaply packaged in plastic bags. I am sure my daughter doesn't mind these are cheaply made or small but i sure as heck do. I could have bought a Kidconnection set from walmart for less money and maybe even of better quality 
My daughter was 2 1/2 when I gave this to her. I use it to teach her food groups and to encourage her to taste the real version. Pretend "invisible" food is fun, but for a little one who has a lot to learn about different foods, to touch and to see is worth 1000 words! 
My 16 month old loves her new groceries. The produce &amp;amp; sandwich parts are plastic &amp;amp; each piece has a wonderful texture. The canned goods are very interesting to read. They are actually labeled by a supermarket in the UK, so they are a bit different from the groceries you would find in the US. I put the cardboard frozen food items away until she is older. She has been entertained at length because each piece is so intricate. This was a great purchase. 
My daughter recieved this kitchen today, and she absolutely loves it! The bins on the left side really need a back on them so that things don't fall out. I would recommend putting this toy together with a ratchet equipped with a screwdriver bit adapter otherwise you will have a sore wrist because it takes a while to get the screws through the thick plastic parts. This toy is definately designed to be durable. I am sure it can withstand whatever my daughter could do to it. Overall I think it is a good investment and a very cute toy 
I bought this for my 2 year old. I was happy that it wasn't huge--fits right in the corner. She loved it when she first got it for Christmas. HOWEVER, My complaints are...everything is just SO small and inefficient! The "microwave" is so high that she can't even reach it with a small stool I bought for her to use just for the kitchen! The back of the little bins are open, and you can't store ANYTHING in there. So, I don't know where they came up with the lots of storage line! I just expected a little bit more of a kitchen--would have changed some of the features. OVERALL it has proven to be a fun toy, but hard to use unless you are really tall 
I bought this kitchen for my daughter on her 2nd birthday. She didn't seem very interested at first and I just figured it would take time for her to like it. I showed her how to play with it and how the sounds work but she was still very uninterested. I think she needs to be a little bit older to fully enjoy it. She plays with it as long as someone is in there playing with her. She can't reach the top shelf yet and gets upset everytime something is placed up there. To tell you the truth my 4 year old sone LOVES it. He loves to pretend to cook things and clean the dishes. This kitchen has withstood my daughter climbing all over it, my husband falling on it and my son standing on it. It is a tough toy! I love that it is so small... it doesn't take up a whole room like most other kitchens and I love that it can be moved easily. I would recommend this toy for anyone who is shopping for a 3 year old or older. I am sure my daughter will enjoy it more once she is a little bit older 
My daughter is 1 and she loves it would be nice to come with a little more food but overall it's great and my 8 year old son thinks so to a great starter kitchen.......... 
I bought this for my 19 month old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She seems a little young and I was skeptical but she has older siblings who enjoy it with her. She is just a tad too short to open the microwave easily but it won't take long until that is a non issue. The stove button is easy to work and she loves the cooking noises, which are not annoying like so many other toy noises. I know I can trust it to last since it is Little Tyke. It is great for those of us who don't have much extra space as it takes up almost none yet has plenty of things to play with. It is also great that it comes with a few items to start out with 
I purchased this kitchen for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived and I started to assemble it only to find a few minor manufacturer defects on one of the pieces that compramised the way it assembled and the way it would "wear" over time. I called Little Tikes' customer service phone number and after explaining the problem they said they would send me a new part immediately. I haven't received it just yet but they said they would try to get it here before Christmas. I was dissappointed when I found the defect and was certain, that with one week remaining before Christmas, that I would have difficulty getting someone to respond to my request for help. I spoke to the nicest man at Little Tikes and was SO impressed at how the company stood behind it's product and sent the needed part with absolutely NO HASSLE! They didn't require me to prove that the part was defective or even return it to them.....they simply took my word for it. I am impressed, more than ever, that the Little Tikes company appreciates their customers......even it they aren't making "large" purchases. This is not one of their most expensive kitchens and yet they still stood behind the quality of their product!! I'll try to update this review once I've recieved the new part and the entire transaction is complete. 
I only have one complaint and that is that the back of the "cubby" holes is completely open and there is now way to place things inside without them falling out behind it. Other than that this was great for my daughter's 2nd birthday. We don't have a lot of room and this is the perfect size. She just loves to turn the knob on the stove and hear the sounds. 
My son's 4th birthday is tomorrow, Sept. 17, and he said he really wanted a kitchen. I wanted to get him a more expensive Step 2 one but he insisted he liked this one the best. (I think he loved the idea of the real towel) I just finished putting it together which was very easy but getting the oven and fridge doors on was a little annoying and they don't close completely u have to push a little to get them closed so I don't know if that will frustrate my son.....we'll see. In the directions it tells u to dab a little dish detergent on the the oven knob to make pushing it in easier, well I saved this part for last and had to use all my might to get the knob on! I don't understand why they can't just attatch the little knob when they making these but oh well. My son will be using this tomorrow and I'll get back with an update! I would also recommend u putting it together before your child knows u got it for them 
This is a VERY! cute set and all the littlest pet shop playsets are hot right now. But Toys r us has this EXACT same item for only $29.99 right now. If you want to buy this toy AND SAVE SOME MONEY, BUY THIS SET FROM TOYS R US. JUST SOME FRIENDLY ADVICE. And happy shopping everyone!!! 
I just did another review on the Diego treehouse set as my twins decided to purchase this and the Deigo set. I will first say we purchased this for much less at a well known local store (not sure if I can say where). It is well made and my girls played with it for hours. They have decided to ask Santa for other pieces to go with this set. I have a whole basket full of Littlest Pet Shop items for them also through Amazon where I found these items to be comparable in price. You will not be disappointed in this purchase 
This toy is so much fun! I play with it every day with my sister brother. Altogether we have about 50 LPS. I have the most 
I never could have imagined that LITTLEST PET SHOP would release another fabulous toy set after the LITTLE LOVIN' PET PLAYHOUSE - which I adore - but they have achieved absolute greatness with the release of the WHIRL AROUND PLAYGROUND. In this set - which requires a minimal amount of assembly - your pets are able to take a ride on the treetop swing set, ride down the slide, spin on the merry-go-round, relax in the comfortable hammock, eat at the cozy cafe, compete in an obstacle course, ride the elevator, sit in the sandbox, and get a view of the world from the observation deck. It is amazing how well each feature in this playset works, and how much fun it is to play with the set. Most animals fit in every area, and more than twenty pets can occupy the WHIRL AROUND PLAYGROUND at a time. This set includes a cute gray mouse, a prissy puppy - who comes with a pair of sunglasses that actually stay on - a food/water combo dish, a bed, and a slide, to make the most of your pets stay at the WHIRL AROUND PLAYGROUND. The best thing this playset offers, however, is the fact that no batteries are required. Things move by the touch of your hand, or by turning something clockwise. A must-have addition to your LITTLEST PET SHOP collection. Hours of fun, and no batteries needed! Erika Sorocco Freelance Reviewer Book Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape 
Both girls, ages 4 and 2 loved this 
My daughter seems to really enjoy it and all the neighborhood girls that come over seem fascinated with it. no problems so far with materials or qualit 
We got this for my daughter's 3rd birthday and it is such a hit! We have had NO issues with the chalkboard thankfully. It was really simple to assemble and is very sturdy. She will be able to use this item for many years to come! 
I bought this easel as part of the classroom I set up for my preschooler. I love the adjustable size, durability and ease of use. My only complaint was the chalkboard. Though I followed the priming instructions diligently, I found that even the good chalk scratched the board and did not write well. Melissa and Doug did reply immediately to my concern and were willing to do whatever necessary to correct the problem. On a whim, I decided to try some chalkboard paint instead. It now writes beautifully, and I love the black chalkboard, rather than the green it came as. It is perfect 
I bought this item for my 3 year old daughter and had the same problem with the chalkboard (not working so well). I call the 800 number on the back of the box and the people in customer service sent me a new chalkboard. I was amazed at how helpful they were and the desire they had to make me happy. I will buy Melissa and Doug toys for years to come. 
After priming the board as the instructions indicated...it is still useless. The chalk actually cuts into the chalkboard so now, my daughter who loved chalk and drawing can't use that side of the easel. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone if they are looking for a product that does what it is supposed to do. I wonder if the makers even tried to use it...why would someone make a product that doesn't work and then expect people to buy it...very disappointing 
My daughter received this for her third birthday. She loves it. I would have to agree with another insert that the chalkboard does not work so well. The dry erase, however is wonderful! I cannot wait to get the paper so that she can start painting next! I would recommend this to three and above. There are some small pieces and the height could pose an issue for smaller children. But overall, GREAT Product! Only downfall, is the they do not provide even a few sheets of paper to get you started and chalk/eraser etc. 
Amazon just raised the price on this within the last few days. Go to your local bookstore where it lists for $19.99. Awesome product, kids love it 
We bought this for our 10 year old grandson last Christmas and he LOVED it. He is interested in animals and he wrote a book about 'dangerous' animals. He had a great time doing it. The finished product is great. His parents had another copy of the book printed by the seller and sent it to us as a gift. We will always cherish it 
My 7 year old received this as a Christmas present. She was so excited to write her own book, we added the about the Author page and she wrote and illustrated the story. We bought one book for our family and the second book we dedicated to her school teachers and gave it to the school on Teacher Appreciation Day with a note that we wanted the book to be placed in the library. Now all of my daughters friends and others can check the book out of the library and they love it! I highly recommend this as a gift to anyone 
I bought this kit for my 6 year old daughter. She couldn't wait to start drawing. She dictated the story for each page and drew extra "love notes" on the remaining pages, and even deticated it to her Nan Nan. We opted to add the "About the auther" with a photo! My daughter did get impatient waiting for the book to come back,.. but since Katrina the mail has been very unreliable. Finally, her package arrived and she LOVED it! We rushed it right over to her Nan Nan. It is a perfect little book, that will be cherished forever. I've already bought 2 more! 
Wonderful product. We bought this as a gift for my son's 7th birthday as a fun incentive to get him a little writing and spelling practice. He loved to make his own books at home with computer paper and the stapler, so a real book was a huge hit. He thought this was great because it is a real bound book with his own words and pictures. His book will be a cherished keepsake and I'm sure it will be great fun to look at when he is grown 
Great idea! The bound book is sweet, not cheesy at all, nice quality. Makes a great gift for grandparents. My teenagers even enjoyed making them. 
I can't say enough about Illustory! My daughter is 6 and in Kindergarten and loved to make stories on paper stapled together. So, Santa brought her an Illustory kit and we did it together as she can't write many of the words yet. So, she drew all the pictures and told me what she wanted to story to say. We got our book in the mail yesterday, and she was so thrilled to see her story bound like a real book! The quality was great, and it even had the dedicaton page and an "about the author" page with her picture (which I provided). We even ordered an extra copy for grandma with a dedication to her! I highly reccomend this kit 
This is a nice idea, though basically they take the same paper that you draw on and bind it. We wanted more pages, and better quality paper than the thin paper they provide, but that cost us an additonal fee to upgrade when we sent the pages in. It did come out very nicely, and my 7 year old is very proud of her work. Overall we were happy, and unlike many other presents, this one was fun and left us with something she can show her friends and look back at later in life 
I would have rated this lower, but the idea is so great. My 7yo loves his book. Be careful w/ the pages you submit. We ordered two books and the first book contains the original submitted pages w/ artwork (except the cover which was scanned and reprinted on "glossy" paper). The 2nd book was, of course, all photocopied pages of the first. They simply take your submitted artwork pages and someone (or possibly an OCR), prints your submitted text just under your drawings; then binds the pages into the book, with the title page , dedication page, etc. Not as sturdy a book as I thought it should be, but as I said, my kid loves it, so that's what matters most. &lt;grin 
My Granddaughter age 9 had so much fun making up her own story, she is still working on the art and then we will have it printed 
An unexciting piece. Of value only to the completist collector (like myself). There's nothing wrong with it, it's just that there's nothing "great" about it either. The lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a "holographic" figure. Hasbro could has done better by choosing another "host" sculpt to base this exclusive off of. The "Phantom Menace" version was much better 
I was so excited when I ordered my Star Wars Holographic Emperor figure. I'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks!! When I got home today, the box with the Amazon logo was on my doorstep. Upon opening the box, I was completely disappointed to find that the Emperor figure I'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed. The people packing this stuff are half-wits!! Anybody with a brain would know better than to cram something into a box like that!! They should be ashamed of their service to all you collectors out there....BEWARE!! 
This is a fun toy to have around, especially for boys and men who think they're boys! Better get yours from Amazon. I have a hunch Toys R Us will sell out quickly. Here's to the little kid in all of us 
My three year old grips these perfectly. And the array of colors make them such an enticing reason to try to learn to write. A great set of markers. Really really great 
My almost 6-year-old son loves drawing and coloring, and this special set is perfect for him. In addition to having *100 different colors* (!) the markers are small with a thin tip. They fit his hands well and he loves having so many colors to choose from. We have had this set for several months and none have dried out or given him any problems. The case is perfect. It is sturdy plastic, snaps shut and has a handle. These are more "grown up" than the Crayola markers and have a much finer tip than even their skinny ones, so they are great for words and small details. We love this set 
We bought this set over a year ago and my daughter is still carrying it with her everywhere. Most marker sets you find in stores only have 24 or 36 colors. Here you have 100 colors to choose from. They come in a zippered case that opens into a full circle of markers arrayed in a beautiful rainbow. Each marker pops into the case so they all have a place and you can instantly see if one is missing. The markers have withstood endless pictures but are now getting a bit dry so we are replacing them. For $15 it seriously may be the #1 value of all the toys we have ever purchased for our children over the years. 
I have trouble believing this is for small children. I tried to play this at a party with some friends. All of us who tried to play are in our 20s and 30s, and we couldn't figure out how the game was supposed to work. The DVD never makes it clear whose turn it is or what's really happening, and there are too many things added to the game from the original. I've played the regular, classic version of Clue many times and enjoy it, but this new version is frustrating, complicated, and not fun at all. I can't imagine that children would actually have fun with this when four adults couldn't even figure out what was going on 
Very interesting spoof of the original game. I found the first one boring after a few plays, but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays. It's a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth it 
After I saw the advertisement for Clue DVD I immediately went out to buy it. I've always been a fan of Clue and this updated version provides players with some new twists and excellent graphics. While you are playing the game, the Butler and an Inspector often appear to provide you with Clues about the case. Another addition to the game is added locations and having to figure the time of the crime. Any Clue fan will appreciate this version 
I always thought Clue looked like a complicated game I'd never touch! That is until I played it at my friends house! Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions! This game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time! I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older 
Excellent product! I really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve. After playing all 50, you can just start all over again! Fun, fun, fun game! THANKS 
This is an extremely fun and addictive game. You shuffle the cards, and place three (room, weapon, person) in the secret envelope. In every room you go into, you can make accusations. If someone has the card you accused (like the room), then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad. The game changes constantly, so it never gets boring. The character pieces have teeny details, like Mr. Green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. I gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really THINK. Oh, and good problem-solving skills too. And coordination (you have to add all the clues up to see who did it). All in all, a terrific game. Great for rainy days or playdates. And did I mention the weapons? Very realistic. And cute 
This was a little difficult to figure out in the beginning - Actually had to read the instructions - but it was very fun and very disney. Fam loves it 
My son received this game for Christmas and it is by far his favorite game. He enjoys pretending to be a detective and the game is easy enough for him to play and understand. I just have to figure out how to get more of the scoring sheets 
It is quicker to play than the boardgame and much more compact.....so easy to bring on trips, etc. 
This game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations. The luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice. Strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have. Sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn. All in all, this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it 
I purchased this set for my daughter as a christmas gift because she saw it while I was browsing online and told me how much she wanted the "puppies". She will love this! The set is much larger than I expected it to be and looks sturdy enough for my 5 year old to play with 
My daughter got this for a birthday gift and has really likes playing with it. She loves palying with animals and this was a perfect fit to the doll house she recieved for Christmas. She is still playing with it several months later 
My daughter received the loving doll house for Christmas and LOVED it, however our family consist of Mommy, Daddy, girl, boy and a golden retriever. When I spotted this item I was so happy to see I could duplicat my daughters real life family. She absolutly loved it. She actually played with just the dogs and accessories for 3 days. It was hard to find in stores so I just ordered it from amazon/toysrus. It was out of stock so she did not get it until after Christmas, but that was ok she said "more presents" when it came in the mail 
Great accessory to the dollhouse for the price. It has lots of parts to teach your child about pet care, feeding, and bathing 
Every child I know loves animals and this is no exception. My three-year-old granddaughter loves to have the puppies get nurtured by the mother dog in her dollhouse. She loves to brush the mother dog's "fur" too. I sometimes play with her and we talk about how to treat animals gently and with kindness. I see her using these traits in her role play with this set. Everything about this set is durable. There is even a sack of dog food and a water dish to remind little ones that all animals need to be taken care of. When I sometimes watch my granddaughter, she will always notice when his food or water dish is empty and come tell me. I notice her giving her "pets" the same consideration. I love this set and so does she! 
With the colder weather here, this is a great activity for the little ones. The smaller pieces in this set are not for children under 3 or still teething. We played for hours on end with Colorforms as kids, always a favorite. 
Hi, I got this gift as a birthday gift from jackie and I would like to say it is amazing. My mom doesnt like the fact tht it gets mesy thowe. I love it. I would share this with any of my friends 
I purchased this coffee maker three years ago. It has been played with by my now 4 year granddaughter and now my 1 1/2 year old grandson is enjoying it also. It has been a very fun set for both the children. It has taken being banged around and taken many falls to the floor but just keeps on working. I have been served many cups of coffee from this set. Recently, I showed the four year old how you could put water in it and it would brew up a pot of coffee, ( something we won't mention to the 1 1/2 old for a while )now it's a whole new toy to her and I now have to really drink all this coffee she makes for me. This is an awesome toy !!! Attractive, realistic and very well made indeed !! Beverly Coutur 
I got this for 14.99 at target. I bought the microave and mixer also for that price. The "coffee" goes up top like real ones. It comes out into the coffee pot. Really cute! I'm suprised by the price on here though 
My 6 year old just loves this set. She can make "real" coffee and has a great time playing make believe in her kitchen. It is well made and durable. Has enough whistles and bells for today's child but still encourages imaginative play 
All right I'm going to be honest. I was over my cousins house and my 4 year old cousin had this toy. She showed me how to use it and it's so cool! My aunt then gave me one for my fourteenth birthday, and my best friend and I have a blast with it! Totally an all ages toy. Now I am completely right in the head. How many parents have looked at this toy and said that looked like fun! WOW great toy 
I bought this toy for my three year old son so we could have coffee parties. Unfortunately, the water leaks right out of the bottom, so barely any coffee makes it into the pot. Perhaps this item isn't supposed to be used with real water? It does not include any helpful directions or tips. Maybe we will send back and try again, but I think he will be heartbroken otherwise to be without his coffee pot 
It it not the "coffee" that we are trying to sell to our kids, it is the whole "role playing" idea that our children love so much that we cater to. While I certainly do not want my child to birth children at the tender age of 3 (more like 30!) I do buy her baby dolls and nursery sets because it is her imagination that I love to watch shine through. I think this is an excellant toy for toddlers! Sit back and let your child giggle and have fun while he/she watches the water go through! There is already too much negative in the world and too many critics want to slam long time favorites of children (barbies), but do your job as a parent and watch your children flourish!!!!!! 
I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She was 2 and 3 months. She just loves it. It's a little messy since she has to have H20 but I just put a towel underneath, give her 1/2 a pot of water and let her go. It has taught her to pour without making a huge mess. Of course, she likes to try to drink out of the straw where the water comes out but that's no big deal. Education value is subjective and hard to rate. We have enjoyed it and purchased 2 others for gifts as well. Enjoy 
First of all I would like to point out that Mr.I-Was-40th-In-Australia is kind of a jerk. Posting up reviews that bash all the other reviews on the page is rude and arrogant, and frankly its pretty egotistical for him to act like his opinion is better than all the others on this board. Although it is true that, by itself, this deck wont be winning any tournaments, you dont have to insult people to point that out. Just remember that this is a Customizable Card Game, so dont worry about switching around cards with this deck to enhance it a bit. That being said, I would like to say that this deck has some really fun cards. In my opinion, not only do the cards have some great powers (Marauding Captain being able to special summon another monster just by being summoned for example). One other thing to note about this deck is it only has 1 monster that you need to tribute summon. Which means if you get a monster in your hand, you can play it. In my opinion the cards in this deck also have some of the coolest pictures of the structure decks too. From the Obnoxious Celtic Guards Mid-Evil look, to the beautiful Warrior Lady of the Waste Land, each card is really colorful and detailed. The folks who design the Yu-Gi-Oh! cards definitely went for the extra package on this. The other thing I want to mention about this deck is its Warrior specific. And in Yu-Gi-Oh! there are more Warrior-type monsters than any other type in the game. What this means is the Warrior-type has the most flexibility, and is the most customizable of all the monster types due to the massive amount of abilities the Warriors have. So when you go to customize this deck, dont worry about having a lack of monsters, spells, or traps to add to it. Final statement: Warriors are like RPG characters. Some may start out weak, but the get far better by adding equipment to them. So here is my suggestion, look around at different Equip Spell Cards to get an idea at what abilities you can to your different Warriors just by adding some good weapons. Combine the equipment with the right abilities and your Warriors can wipe out anything your enemy sends at you 
If there's 1 monster that helps me it's armed samurai- ben kei. it can attack as many times as it has equip cards plus his regular atttack! i have 2x Axe of despair, 1 mage power and 1 shooting bow star ceal. i also would hav royal decree on the field. that is 4000 attack points and attacks 5 times to your pponents life points. it is hard to get the cards tho 
I have this deck. It's real fun! I have the Blaze of Destruction deck to. I have a HUGE deck(:. I have these way cool cards: Dark blade, Back fire, Mefist the infernal general, Precious cards from beyond, Nobleman of crossout, Swift Gaia the fierce knight, Roc from the valley of haze, Meteor of destrution, Woodborg inpachi, Obelisk the tormentor, Blazing inpachi, Thestalos the firestorm monarch, blast with chain, pot of greed, Blue eyes white dragon, dust tornado, and reinforcement of the army. The structure decks ROCK!! If you want single cards from booster packs, check out www.yugiohetc.com. Thanks 
The cards can be used as a stand alone deck or it can be introduced into your current deck. This card came is good for subtraction math skills for younger children (scorekeeping). Of course the game is alot of fun. 
My six year old really enjoys these cards. He plays with the neighborhood boys and his sister. He said it had a lot of cards he didn't have 
Well, I have had these cards for a while and I love them!I mean I have thought of 5 combos and have won duels with all of them. If your a fan of warriors I recommend you buy it. Plus all you have to do is add a few elemental heroes and you have a mini Jaden deck 
I've played yugioh for a year or two and I know a good deck when I see one. This is definatly one of those decks! It has won duels 95% of the time! It works together very well and is by far the best structure deck yet. If you get a deck, this is the one you should get 
A true piece of entertainment in more ways than one! Pen, various pieces of colored Chalk, and an eraser all together in a nice tidy carrying case. Hours of entertainment, play-time, and even learning can all be achieved with this set. A wonderful gift for any child, and even useful for parent teaching as well 
got this for my grand daughter she really enjoys it takes it every where easy to pack around she puts other stuff in it to bring with her she also pretends shes off to work like mam 
My son had been asking for some gears for his construction things, legos, k'nex, etc. I had checked with lego education to find their smallest set to be over $100. Theses K'nex ones are great, especially for the price. The case is a little difficult to open, but then again it keeps his sister from opening the box and losing a peice or two. I gave it a four because I wish the set had a few more gears in it, my son's only complaint. I will probably buy some individual gears to add to his set from K'nex Education site. It is well worth the price to teach a kinetic child the concept of gears!! 
My bought this hoping that my kids would be able to finally sing along with one of the songs. In an effort to "jazz up" these kids songs, many of them are difficult to sing a long with. The seller was great. I'm just not impressed with this Fisher Price System. Neither are my kids. 
This was definitely a hit for my little one. We got this for our 5 yr old and she loves (and knows) all the songs 
Who knew I would be interested in numbers. SuDoku requires concentration - even at the easiest levels. The only downfall I found with this game was the instructions. I was already loosly versed in SuDoku via the Parker Vector 3-in-1 Pen 'channel' on AvantGo for the PocketPC. When I compare my knowledge coming in to this version of the game, I find that the instruction sheet is vague in some areas. But if you or someone you know enjoys numbers games, this one is a KEEPER. Enjoy 
My son came up with the word "moo-tastic". He loves his "Moo-Mixer". I have to say, it is really cool. And, the little spinner that mixes the milk is safe for kids -- no sharp edges. The next child whose birthday party we are invited to is getting a "Moo-Mixer" 
I bought this for my fiancée and she loved it. She hasn't used it that much so I don't know how durable it is. My main complaint is that it didn't come with batteries 
This playhouse is the best! We bought this for Christmas for our five children. I was initially hesitant about buying a playhouse due to the unattractive look that playhouses become over time. I applaud the decision of STEP 2 to produce products with a neutral palate because this product looks as good as the day we bought it!! We live in the hot Arizona sun, and the colors look as crisp as the day we bought it. Well worth the money--great design and very durable. 
My twin girls love this cottage. It was so easy to put together. We have it in our living room/playroom. It's the perfect size cottage, for our girls. 
It's been the best purchased I've ever done in my life. It's worth every penny. If it burns down, I'll buy it again. 
We got this for my son and he loves it! This was bought because I loved the design of it and paid the extra for the step2 name and awesome design! I now wish I would have just stuck with our little tikes imaginesounds playhouse though. I have tried to order replacement stickers for this and am unable to, so the doorbell is faded and stove stickers about missing, rain comes in and sets on stove and sink area. My son still loves it but I like my toys to be clean and new looking. He is 3 now and has had it about a year, he enjoys running in and out pretending with the phone 
After seeing Zoobs in a classroom, I was determined to buy them for my grandson. Of course, I forgot until the week before Christmas. Was real glad to still be able to get them in time via Amazon - and my grandson loves them. They're more versatile than legos, and just different enought to be fascinating. 
Santa brought these for our 4 year old and 2 year old. They love them. They really spark their imaginations and creative sides. My husband and I even like playing with them with the kids... My 2 year old can't quite click the main pieces together without help but he tries and still enjoys them. My four year old builds houses, crowns, necklaces... 
I ordered Zoobs at the request of our daughter as a Christmas gift for our almost six-year-old grandson. He loves to create things from Legos, Lincoln logs, etc., so our daughter was certain he would like Zoobs. We gave them to him at Christmastime, but I haven't heard a report. They looked like neat plastic, colorful things with which to build, and I expect Ethan has been enjoying them 
my daughter this bed , she loves putting her doll baby to bed at night and it fits her other dolls too, not just the tidoo we purchased to go with it, we are very pleased with this purchase 
My daughter was pleased as punch. She got 900 feet (that's a lot for child sized mittens and scarves!) of yarn and a pretty basket to keep the things neat. The needles were just fine. A few other kits at our local shop were going for twice this and didn't have as much yarn and the "baskets" were cheap plastic tubs. If something is damaged I know we usually exchange the item to the store or call the manufacturer and they're more than happy to replace items. Also my daughter is seven years old and just entered 1st grade and she had no problems understanding the instructions with a little help from me 
We bought this at the Thomas visiting train event for $6.95. I like the colorforms over regular stickers, as they are much more durable in the hands of my 2yo. My 3yo is thrilled that so many trains were included in the set. However, for the 1-inch thick box, all you get for sticking these on is the picture on the cover. Once all the tracks were occupied, my son started started sending the trains to the Great Scrap Heap In The Sky. Either that, or they sprouted invisible wings. For this to be a truly good product, the background should have been 1) oriented the other way, and 2) should have had at least three other backgrounds - the docks, Tidmouth Sheds, or some other locations. Once again, I am disappointed by the Thomas merchandising machine 
I love that they came up with a Colorform set for this. I am disappointed, however, by how expensive it is for what you get. This set costs almost $10 after shipping. I found one at our pharmacy for $3.50 a week later! The stickers don't stick well and you can't get them to stay on the "storage sheet". The background for the stickers to go on is too small and done "portrait style", when it should be "landscape". This toy is still played with and enjoyed, but I wish I had paid a lot less for it 
This is my fifth Force FX lightsaber. Its beautiful but a bit heavy. The sound is very muffled and the hilt it a bit too thick to be accurate. Although its my favorite design, the Luke Skywalker Green lightsaber is much better. Its the brightest and loudest I have out of the Ep.2 and Ep.3 Anakin, Darth Vader, and this Obi Wan. If your a huge Obi Wan fan like myself its great, but if your not on a Star Wars kick when you get it your likely to be a bit disappointed as I was 
These new FX Lightsabers are so cool and worth the money!!! (Under $[...]) I play with the lightsaber all the time with my daughter and nephews who use my other FX Lightsaber, YES I own 2 of these GREAT ITEMS!!! The sounds, look, and feel of these Lighsabers are so real and authentic to the movies. When these "Lazer Swords" strike one another the make the exact sounds as they did in the BEST story of all times, The Star Wars Saga 1-6. When I took a picture of myself with my Lightsabers and sent them to my nephews, who are 6 and 11 years old they thought I had gotten them from The Star Wars movie itself, THAT'S HOW REAL THEY LOOK!!! To conlude this review, this item is a great gift for your favorite Star Wars fan and a great purchase for any Rabid Star Wars Fan and it only takes 3, YES count em THREE double A batteries, and you also get a stand that you can mount to the wall and put up and take down your Lightsaber at will!!! How cool is that?!!! If you buy this HAVE FUN BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN, I KNOW I CAN'T!!!!!!!! 
Bertie is part of the Thomas the Train friends toys. We gave it to my 2-yr old grandson a few weeks ago. It is well made and holding up to a 2-yr old's playing enthusiasm. It has been played with daily and has been a safe and durable toy 
Only problem with this toy is that both brothers want to play with it at the same time. 
This is one of my 2 year old son's favorite characters. It is a well made toy and has survived being thrown around...or as he says "Bertie Crash!" 
My son loves this little bus. It is well made and a charming wooden toy. It is a nice addition to the Thomas the Tank Engine set (wood not dye-cast) 
Now you can own Bertie the bus, Thomas' loyal friend who has always been there to help. Thomas first met Bertie when he got stuck in the snow. Terence came to rescue Thomas and Bertie came to pick up Thomas' passengers. The next time Thomas and Bertie met, Bertie challenged Thomas to a race. If you haven't seen that story, I will not tell you who won, but you can find that story on a lot of Thomas tapes. The only bad thing about this toy is that it doesn't have any magnets or anything but I guess your child will just have to use his/her imagination 
Bertie is nice to have but my son barely plays with it. It won't attach to anything else, no magnets. Like another review says, it doesn't go well on the tracks, even the the road side of the dual purpose tracks. 
We recently purchased a road expansion pack for my son's Thomas train layout and Bertie was included. He's got bright red paint and a pleasant smile, and his road expansion set makes a nice addition to the train set. My son has several of the Thomas vehicles and they provide him with hours of fun play. Purchase Bertie or any of the other fine Thomas products for your children. They will definitely have hours of fun playing with them 
My son is in love with trains. Thomas is his favorite show by far, but he'll watch anything with trains, even documentaries. And one of his favorite stories is the race between Thomas and Bertie. So we got him this for Christmas. He loves it. He has a little train mat with tracks and stations on it, so he plays and plays. If you have a Thomas fan, this is sure to be a winner 
This game is fabulous! The game comes in a tin so it is easy to keep it in good condition (i.e. no broken box with scattering pieces!). The "bonus disc" has a feature where the narrator reads the questions for younger players, which is wonderful for your 3-6 age group! Adults don't even have to be in the same room to use the "party play" feature on the bonus disc, which makes it great for slumber parties! This game is also good for adult disney fans! There are some clips from older movies like "The Apple Dumpling gang" and "The Cat from Outer Space" (so yes mom and dad...you do have a chance at winning)! This game is perfect for the whole family 
Great game! It has all the new Disney Movies and the oldest movies are really old. Just think the game could be a little bit more tricky but it's reallfy fun, but definitively for 6 yeard old children there are some very difficult questions. The backgroud music is kind of annoying but you can live with Mute ja,j 
I have a very tall 4 year old and an almost 2 year old. They were constantly fighting over foot room in the big Step 2 wagon. I broke down and bought this $[...] Radio Flyer Navigator wagon. After using it for a couple of months now, it was well worth the money. It is considerably bigger (wider seats, slightly more room for feet) plus a storage seat to boot. It is a much nicer ride (nicer wheels, longer handle, feels less likely to tip over even with sharp turns). I use this wagon to cart my kids everywhere, fromt the mall to the museums. Since this wagon holds up to 150lbs, I figure I'll get another couple of years out of it. Very much worth the money. 
My girlfriend and I purchased this gift as a shower gift for our friend's third child. Although, the baby technically can't use it right away, it will help her and her husband navigate life with three kids at pumpkin patches, amusement parks, fairs, walks, etc. The kids LOVE it and were really excited to explore the cooler compartment under the seats. It wasn't hard for her husband to assemble and is great quality. My friend and I will likely purchase the shade for the wagon at Christmas time. We know they will get a childhood's worth of use from it and it will help them to create wonderful childhood memories as a family 
I purchased this wagon for my soon to be 1 year old Grandson, as a Valentines Day present. He loves being pulled all over the house as well as outdoors. I am sure he will get many hours of fun from this wagon. 
I purchased this wagon yesterday for my 3-1/2 year old daughter. I absolutely love it. She is over 40 inches tall and fits in it comfortably. I love the cup holders and storage area under the back seat. You can take this wagon anywhere and have a place to put snacks or other items. It is very easy to pull and the handle is longer than most. The is alot of room for 2 children to sit without constantly kicking each other. My parents purchased a radio flyer all terrain wood and metal wagon for her for her first Christmas. Its a great wagon but now she wants to have one to sit in. It also fits in the back of my van so we will be taking this to parades and for walks from now on 
We bought this wagon for our almost 2 year old and at first we loved it. We bought it for the storage and door, thought it would be easier and she would feel independant. She did love the door but it would NEVER stay closed, we tried everything. It would clsoe but as we walked work itself open, our daughter even fell out because it opened as we were walking. It is a great concept but just didn't work. We took this back and got the Pathfinder wagon instead 
We recently purchased this wagon for our 21 month-old daughter. She likes riding in it. I do wish the wagon had a brake on it, though. That is my only regret 
First off, this thing is truly the greatest toy my daughter has ever had. She got it for her first birthday, and loves it. Having said that--how about putting some kind of a brake on this thing? She's just starting to walk, and she's climbing all over it. It would be great if it could stay in one place solidly. Also, why doesn't this one have the safety straps, like the Pathfinder does? But really, this thing is amazing. I'm more hoping that the company will read this and add some braking system, than trying to discourage parents from buying it. Heck, all I have to do is put a stick under the tire and it holds still just fine, I just think it'd be better with a simple brake. It is a safe, tough, well built wagon. I liked this one best. 
When we were looking for wagons I tried so many of them out in the store. I finally settled on this one because I wanted the plastic for durability and the little flip up seats and seat belts because I was not too sure that my 1 year old would sit still to ride in the wagon. I casually mentioned this wagon and described it to my grandparents saying I was putting it on my son's Christmas list. 2 days later my grandpa called and had found the wagon BRAND NEW at a yard sale for $8.00. Can you imagine that! My son got it as a birthday gift, and it has remained on of his favorite toys ever. He immediately climbed in it and sat down. We wouldn't have to fasten the straps, but we usually do. I like the fact that he can't fall out of the wagon backwards when we go uphill or if I start pulling it too suddenly. The fact that it converts to a flat bottom wagon also is nice for hauling stuff around the garden or laundry from one end of the house to the other. We typically keep the wagon in our garage, and I had to move it to the side of the car opposite that of the door to the house because every time I would let my son out of the house to get in the car he would climb in the wagon and cry when I got him out. Every chance he gets he pulls it out of its parking spot and wants to go for a ride. The few times I have brought it inside he has played for hours with it- which for a 1 year old is remarkable. Steering is a little more difficult due to the handle being atached to the wagon and the tires rotating instead of the traditional design, but that just means it is less likely to tip over. It is light and even fit in the trunk of our volkswagen passat along with a lot of luggage and a few other birthday gifts. I was surprised! We will be taking it on trips to the zoo from now on. Definitely worth the money- it is an investment that should last for years 
I bought this wagon for my son this Christmas and he plays with it more than anything else in the house. Even though he hasn't had a chance to take a ride in it outside, he is loving it. He pulls it in front of the TV to watch movies and he is especially fond of the cup holders. I think that this would make the perfect gift for any child. Plus, if I am wanting to do a quick clean up of his toys it has a storage area in the seat that he is more than happy to keep filled 
They love to assemble new variations each day. It is truly one of the best buys for them. I am sure it will help them now and in the future to develope concepts and assemble them.I had tinkertoys in my youth and have always felt it helped me solve practical problems later in life 
My 4 year old grandson loves the Tinker Toys. It will occupy him forever 
Brilliant. Simple, easy to use creatively, encourages practice with spatial relations and engineering.. My (currently four year old) son plays with his Tinker Toys all the time. He never seems to get sick of these 
My six year-old received this for his birthday and hasn't given it a second glance. But he was the same with Lincoln Logs a while back and now loves them. So I haven't given up hope yet 
a good toy for inspiring the constructive minds of your toddler but some of the longer wood sticks broke off easily.. 
I purchased the wooden version of this toy over the plastic version because I thought the wooden would be more durable. I cannot speak for the plastic set, but the wooden set is certainly not made the way it was when I was a child. I bought this for a Christmas present, and a month later many of the parts are damaged. Many of the ends of the rods have cracked off. A few rods broke when I was playing with my two daughters, so I know the breakage occured during average and gentle play. I was very disapointed in the overall quality. This is another classic toy that is now being produced overseas, and is not the toy it once was. 
Feeling nostalgic and romanticizing the educational value of *classic* toys, I decided to buy this one for my 4 yr old son for Christmas. At the same time, my SIL bought him a "Kid K'Nex Roll and Go Pal." I was dissapointed that she purchased a competing toy so I defiantly broke out the Tinker Toy first. Both of my children were quickly bored. The wood pieces were very stiff and hard to fit together and, well . . . I'm not sure how to describe this but, the various pieces don't make any sense. It's as if someone took a bunch of different shaped objects and threw them into a can. They don't relate together in any meaningful way. I couldn't think of ANYTHING interesting to build and neither could my kids So, we moved onto the K'Nex and the kids have been playing with it ever since. They have made some of the funniest things I've ever seen. As much as I hate to admit it, there are just better toys out there than this one these days 
I bought a set of tinkertoys for my 6 year old son. Unfortunately, since there are no detailed, step by step isntructions, we found it too frustrating to reproduce some of the elaborate creations pictured on the container. We also broke several pieces in the first few hours. Maybe I'm just spoiled with K'Nex, and the very detailed instructions they come with. Maybe for some kids who just want to use their imagination to build their own creations, this would be a good toy. My son really wanted to build the creations pictured on the container, so this toy did not work for us, so we returned it 
I purchased a tinkertoy set for my grandaughter for Christmas. After only a half hour of play we had 3 broken pieces. By the next day we had six. This was not rough or unsupervised play. I contacted Hasbro and they will replace the 6 pieces. What a disappointment. They must not be using the same wood to make the most recent sets 
Our Nephew is very in to the Cars movie and toys. We bought the King car and two others for him. I love this part, we had them sent to him since we would not be with him for Christmas. When the packages arrived, his mother gave him the boxes and said they were from us for Christmas, he shook the first box and is began to rattle because of the car inside it. He then went to the other two boxes and shook them too. His mom asked if he wanted to open the boxes and he said no that would break them. He thought the shaking boxes were his present 
My nephew has this car. While it's pretty simple, it is a really neat toy. The car looks way cool. When you shake it, the engine starts up, then Richard Petty talks to you and the car takes off. The review says it goes up to 20 feet, but I think it will go further. It went well even on carpet. This is easy enough for a 3 year old to work, but it also would be good for any fan of Richard Petty. How often do ya find a running Superbird these days 
Bought this as a gift. It was well liked. A game of intellectual challenge which is great for people who like to play game like chess. The game was good quality and what I expected. I like that it folds up for easy storage. 
When I first purchased this board, my expectations were high, however what I was met with left me in absolute disappointment. For avid Go Players, this is not the board for you. Although if you were a real avid Go Player you would have purchased the 7000 Dollar Kaya Board, however my budget doesn't allow it. This board's workmanship is done quite well, and no matter how you play it, Go is Go, Online, on the board, on paper, etc. Now to the heart of the matter, the major problem with this particular brand of board, is the size. The stones are also poor, but you do not expect top quality stones for as cheap as this board is. However, the boards size, which is incredibly to small doesn't allow you to use other brands of stones if you've purchased them. So you are stuck with a tiny board, and terrible tiny plastic stones that are lighter than a feather. The playing experience isn't pleasant and one false move will scatter the pieces everywhere and you can say goodbye to that game. My advice: do not purchase this board unless you are a beginner and unable to get anything else, but even then I think a beginner would have a greater experience by playing on paper, with adequate Ing Stones. Or perhaps play online. Overall, this board is terrible 
We are doing a research on poeple who have turned to the dark side! Do you feel evil? Does the vision of your neighboor in a heap of robes amuse you? Are you balling your eyes out every day like anakin? Do you tend to do bad things on STAR WARS KOTOR 12? Do you want this lightsaber? Do you crave spicy cheese on nachos? Do you put hot sauce on every thing; Spaghetti-o's to chicken? If you said yes to any of these questions, then you might be a sith! Every Sith needs a light saber! Do you feel all classic? A single blader is for you! Feel like Revan? Wanna do things quickly so you can make your way to the kitchen within 60 seconds? Two single bladers are for you! No? Then you are HOPELESS! Wait... A NEW KIND?! You hopless people are now hopeful! Wanna do 360's with a light saber, act like a gymnastic, and cut things open so their guts spill out like smoked sausage! Follow Exar Kun, Bastila Shan, Darth Maul and other people with a double bladed light saber. Do not strike things with this saber. THEY WILL DO NOTHING except brake your light saber!!!!!!!!!!! 
Covered many topics that my 3rd grader is covering in school. It makes learning them fun and reinforces some very important skills. 
On "Let's make a sentence" the subject and predicate are color coded. My son matches the colors and doesn't read them to make a sentence. On level 2 you make a sentence and it is timed. He just hits the colors. On the "Wacky Word Race" the parts of speech are also color coded. He just matches the colors and doesn't read the words. It would be more challenging if they were not color coded. It is not cheat proof 
My 3 year old daughter was given a wedgits set for Christmas and everyone played with it! Its a great toy that helps kids create spatial development and also helps them follow patterns. It is also a fun toy to play with together as a family. I would definitely encourage people to give this toy as a gift 
We purchased the Deluxe set for my 3 year old for Christmas. He absolutely loves them and so does my seven year old. In all honesty...you almost need two Deluxe sets to really get creative 
This is a great toy for a child who enjoys stacking things. You can also expand the collection as your child advances his/her skill. Highly recommended 
I bought this for my 4 year old grandson and he loves it---the problem is, his 8 and 12 year old sisters do too. The blocks are so different from all their others, and the figures on the box are easy to replicate, even for the 4 year old 
We bought this particular set as present for a three year old. We have bigger Wedgits set for my 5 year old and she loves it. This set is a great starter for you super smart todler. Even if their little hands are not steady this set is very easy to balance. Peases of piramid could be put on vertically as well. Designs can go from very simple to a very elaborate and captivate the whole family. We love it : 
I love them so does my daughter. It keeps us both thinking out of the box and entertained for hours. 
i bought this Deluxe Set for my 6-year-old son. he enjoys it a lot, played with it hours every day. my 3-year also are able to build sth interesting from it. execellent open-ending toys to inspire imagination, suitable for wide age range... strongly recommanded and plan to buy more wedgits se 
I bought the wedgits deluxe set for my preschool. I actually purchased 2 for different rooms and they are always being used. The children are very creative with them making a variety of different patterns and not even bothering with the book. These are durable and of great interest. I recommend them 
After Christmas our house was swamped with toys so we decided to invest in a toybox. After looking around online, I decided that this would be the best to meet our needs. It arrived in about a week with the free shipping. It came in the manufacturer's box. It was so easy to assemble, I did it by myself in about 15 minutes with just a screw driver. The inside is one piece which I was confused about when reading the description. It is almost like a giant canvas bag that attaches to the frame consisting of metal rods that screw into the two plastic sides. It is very sturdy and holds ALL of our toys. It is kind of on the larger side if you are worried about space. I would say that it is bigger than the average coffee table. The top does not stay attached but it does rest in the grooves and can stay open. I like the idea that it can be removed when in use and put back on when company comes over. My daugher is 19 months and she can't quite reach to the bottom to grab all of her toys so some assistance is needed on my behalf. I also love the pockets on the side. I store her favorite books in them. All in all, this is a great toybox and the price is fantastic. Highly recommend 
I love these 2 sets of clothes for Ken! Wow! There are two outfits for the office: (1) white shirt, red tie, black pants, black loafers and (2) light blue and white striped shirt , burgundy tie and khaki pants and black loafers. The other two pairs of footwear are blue sandals and white sandals suitable for the beach and hot weather. The other six outfits are casual outfits in cheery colorful designs. Two of the casual tops even have the words "Ken Sport" like a logo. The other two casual tops have the initial "K". It's fun to dress Ken in these new cute outfits 
Its no wonder Barbie dumped Ken for Blaine....look at this sad line of clothing that Ken has to wear!! All the bright colors and terrible style, Ken looks like he is stuck in the Eighties! Maybe if Mattel took sometime to update Ken's fashion since Barbie would come back to him! Oh and also I think Ken needs some good arms like Blaine so he can hold her! 
We looked long and hard both online and in stores for a table that our daughter could use for a number of years to come. She is a tall 6 year old with two older brothers (8 and 9). After finding this table online, we waited before ordering. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Now that we have the table, we like it very much. It is extremely sturdy and has a nice paint finish. My daugher is thrilled with the drawer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We also purchased 4 of the Brighton chairs in various colors. This set fits all three of our children and they enjoy playing kitchen or eating lunch together. We recommend this table and think that it may be a piece of furniture that our daughter can hand down to her daughter 
the corners of the table look cracked like the table was dropped. I asked for an exchange, but didn't get a reply. Don't know if I'm getting a new table or not and I know I only have thirty days to exchange. The chairs came with imperfections, but I'm willing to live with those. This table and chairs look beautiful in the room and will serve her for many years because it is not small. I like the draw for her pencils, papers and crayons 
Loved this game when a friend first brought it over, so I had to buy one, too. The rules are simple, it does not require knowledge of facts or trivia and creates lots of laughter 
I bought this game for my 12 year old daughter. It's alot of fun to play with a group. Everyone has to answer questions about each other and the most popular answer wins. It's a great way to find out what everyone realy thinks about you - but in a fun way! For example. Imagine If _____ was a cookie what kind would she be. 
I love this game and would suggest it for any family gathering. It is possible to suggest a poor answer just to make a point to that ulltra-conservitive sister or that free spirit brother who needs to get a job. A great way to unite two families or a holiday event that would otherwise drag on. Put the kids to bed and invite their friends. I don't want to tell you more as if I was to be a reviewer of something what would I review? Then every one guesses. Accounting statements? Books? Pornorgraphic movies? Then I select the one I like the best. The play continues. Trust me and keep the kids away if you are really having fun 
Imagine if you were a cat, would you... 1.) nap all day 2.) bring your owner dead mice 3.) be a scaredy cat 4.) constantly cough up hairballs. You know what you would do, but perhaps everyone else thinks differently of you, and unfortunately, the majority rules. We loved this game. In this game you write names on a board with a dry erase marker. As each person rolls the die they move around the board landing on certain names and then reading the "Imaginiff" question about that person. The names you all choose to write on the board can be those of the people playing, people you all know who are not there, or even famous people, it is all up to you. In fact, that aspect of the game makes the game virtually brand new every time you play it. We had many laughs finding out what we all thought of each other. Don't have thin skin though because you might just leave with a bitter taste in your mouth 
This game came highly recommended as entertaining for a broad sweep of ages and a good "ice-breaker" game. We tried playing it with an 9 yr old and he was clueless about many of the descriptions. Spending time explaing them was tiring and not fun. If you don't already know one another, you're stricly guessing about their personality and there's not real payoff to be right. If you DO know the others, you'll find yourself walking a fine line between funny and hurt feelings. We LOVE Balderdash and Wise and Otherwise. Imaginiff is not a player among this group. I'd return it if I could 
This game is a winner, especially for those who shy away from solo performance (as required in Pictionary or Charades, for example) and intense competitive aspects of other games. Imaginiff requires insight and attention to the personalities of other players and invites interesting conversation about how we perceive one another. Many of the questions are hilarious and clever. A great family or party game 
My mother-in-law sent this for my son this Christmas and it is such a hit. Definitely a toy for the thinking child. My son is 9 and although I do have to minorly assist him, he is absorbing everything. Products used in the experiments are replaceable with common household items--such a plus for us because once is never enough. This product seems extremely durable, too, with holders for all the tubes, beakers, etc. I did see that the guide was age-inappropriate (i.e. Why does my child need to know that so-and-so was an exotic dancer before coming on the squad?), so I had to give it an overall 4. I hate to do that, but this is a toy. 
I bought this toy because I wish to be a DNA analyst/CSI when I grow up. It is alot of fun, and I have learned alot from it so far. I love it! I'm Greg Sanders in training. =D 
My daughter recieved this for christmas and she loves it. She is four and a half and has no problems using it. I like that you can control the volume so it is not too loud. The headphones fit great too! Great portable cd player for kids 
This twin set is beautiful, and the faces are adorable. The quality is nice, and the clothing is well made and easy to remove. I ordered it through ToysRUs and it came very quickly. 
I received the wrong item. It was supposed to be a Christmas present for my little girl and I had to hurry and find this item at another store. The company still has not sent me a call ticket for UPS to come and pick it up so I can receive a refund after many emails. I will not be purchasing from this company ever again 
These dolls are great! My daughter and 2 nieces always want to play with these dolls over all the other dolls. We have sets to be sure there are enough to go around. They are snuggly and small enough for them to carry around. I personally love that the clothes don't come off! I tire of hunting down doll socks and with these I don't have to! Great dolls 
She loves them! They are so cute and cuddly! They go everywhere with us and they always have to have their bottles ;) They are a must for any little girl who loves baby dolls 
As of yet, I have not bought this toy, but am going to buy it for my daughter this year. I believe that Leira misunderstood the caps. They are for newborns to keep their heads warm after they are born. If you go to most hospitals, the babies are given caps similar to this one. In most cases, identical. Therefore, the caps that you have created for them are correct concidering the age of the babies. 
I have 6 kids and the 5 that are old enough to play with these babies LOVE them. The boys (3,5,and 7) and the girls (2 and 5) all play with them day in and day out. They go everywhere. Right now we only have 2 babies and the care center. There is a bit of fighting for them, so for Christmas I am buying the checkup center with baby and additional babies so there is enough to go around. These are one of their favorite things to play with and they are worth more than the cost! When my 2 month old daughter was born it was great to see my 7 year old son wrapping up one of the babies and mimicing me. I love to see that my boys are learning to be loving and nurturing as well as my girls. My only wish is that in addition to the girl/boy twins they offer, they should offer boy/boy twins 
i just wanted to see if a person got it because i am geting the toy and it looks cute and i just love babydolls there the only thing i like the best at of all the toys and i am growing up im telling you i love baby dolls please say this toy is good please please please ? if you have any info about this toy contact me at [...]thanks everybody i love you all... 
This is a great replica! Purchased for halloween! Very thick medallion, but the chain isn't the greatest! Lost the clasp on the way to a halloween party (let me tell you the drama!) Just watch out for it! Make sure you try to reinforce the clips before you put it on a child 
I gave this to my latest friend and it's so effective as I expected 
I finally have a piece from a film that makes me feel a part of the film and cannot believe how wonderful the necklace i 
This is my favorite Christmas prezent of ALL TIME!!! I think the reason this is always soo rare is because no one can get enough of it! Even at a high price it still fills joy in the eyes to just lay them apon it! I luv it soo much, my second favourite item after my autographed pic of Orlando Bloom that he, himself sent me!! 
I purchased this product for my 11 year old daughter. I thought that she might be too old for this when she mentioned it. She has had hours of fun with this. It's a good produc 
I bought this toy for my 3-year-old daughter who is obsessed with cutting hair. I am happy with the purchase. The inside chamber is easy for my daughter to fill, and she can easily switch the scalp attachments by herself. She occasionally needs my help to attach the person to the base. Right now she is too young to use the press molds for hairbows, mustaches, etc., but as she gets older I think she will enjoy them. My only complaint is that the pink lever/stand does not click firmly into the larger yellow base that holds the accessories. They frequently come apart. A minor problem but annoying nonetheless 
My three and seven year old daughters have been playing with this toy for over an hour now. The three hair pieces that came with our set slide right onto the head with ease (we do not have the problem that the last reviewer had). I do, however, have to help set the little figure back on the base after the play doh is filled in; if it is not set in properly the play doh will not come out correctly. I am happy with this purchase, especially since the set currently comes with a free set of multi-colored play doh. 
I bought this for our three-year old daughter. This product is not made for a three-year old as the headpieces do not fit properly into the actual head. My daughter became frustrated trying to play with this toy so her 10-year brother tried to help her out. He couldn't even get the head pieces to fit. You have to force the piece into the head by squeezing the plastic and forcing it in. Decided to throw the whole thing away after my finger was pinched between the forehead and the headpiece. Again, Don't waste your money 
My Son got the mini golf for Christmas, What a Blast. All 3 of my children love this game. My oldest, 7, is really good, she beats me. My 5year loves it and so does my 4 year old. Very easy to play, no little toys, and so much fun. My kids have played this toy everyday since Christmas. Perfect!!!!!! 
I purchased this from Toys R Us after reading the reviews here on Amazon (I could not purchase through Amazon). Our boys (21, 16, 11 and 4) are having a blast. The other choice was Golden Tee which I also wanted to purchase but quickly changed my mind after reading the Amazon reviews. This was a great gift for the price I paid, which was less than $20, and the graphics aren't bad either!! I'm extremely pleased. 
What a great toy!!! With three boys they all took turns playing. The different courses kept them busy for awhile. great idea!! 
What a great idea. This game is a lot of fun. My 6 year old got it for his birthday. It takes a bit of coordination to accomplish the goal of getting the ball in the hole. With a little practice he has become quite good at it. The way it works is you swing the golf club over top of the ball sensor. On the TV your swing is captured in the game and directs your ball. You can control how hard you swing and where you aim. It seems that this game is more frustrating for some kids. When my son's friends came over to play some of them picked it up quickly and others got frustrated with it. Overall, with some practice this has become a fun game in our family 
My 6 year old son got this for his birthday and it was the first toy he wanted to play with, so once his guests had left we set it up and started playing. It comes with six different themed 9-hole courses, and we played all six once, and they were all fun in their own way with unique obstacles. The lowest score for each course gets saved and that player gets to input his name for future bragging rights. The design of the toy is unique. You aim by turning a dial on top of the toy, and you can use the club as a long-handled lever so you don't need to bend over between strokes. Once your shot is set up you swing the club over the "golf ball" part of the toy, and how fast you swing determines the on-screen speed of your putt. Unfortunately my son managed to whack the toy several times during our evening's play, and when we set it up this morning for another round he hit the toy a couple more times. The problem was compounded because while in real golf you watch the ball with the intention of actually hitting it, with this game you feel compelled to watch the on-screen action while swinging above the ball. Our game this morning ended when the on-screen picture started to flicker and the toy finally froze on the 9th hole; freezing much the same way your Windows computer locks up. Turning the toy off on resolved the problem but on our next game we got just 4 holes in when the problem returned and the game froze once again. While I'll acknowledge that the toy did take several good whacks from my son, I'd expect more from a toy that the designers should have anticipated would get hit, and hit frequently. We'll return this to our local Toy Store and exchange it, perhaps we just got a faulty toy. We'll know within a couple of days if the problem was just that we got a faulty toy, or if M dropped the ball on this one 
We bought this item 5 years ago while my son was only 1-1/2 years old, by then he couldn't reach the pedal but wanted to ride on it so bad, since I'm petite (102 lbs.) I drove it around our yard together with my son. It is great! Now my son is already 6 years old and had a little sister (2 years old) they are having fun driving it together. My yard is not smooth, it is gravel driveway but I can say this Gator surpassed my expectation! I noticed the plastic wheels kept spinning on uphill surface but just a little push it works, other than that my son loves driving it in our dirt round-about and it runs fine 
Unless you have a perfectly flat yard with golf-course grade grass and absolutely no twigs, leaves, pinecones, moisture, or variations in ground level, this thing won't go. On flat concrete it seems to do OK. In the yard, however, we are forever PUSHING this thing around because it cannot go on it's own. The wheels are constantly spinning out. We bought it as a 3rd birthday gift for my son. Obviously, he would like to ride it, but we hardly ever use it because my husband and I hate walking behind him and pushing! We thought we had purchased a great thing after all the reviews. We were wanting him to have fun and help us with yard work by hauling sticks/leaves/pinecones around. How wrong we were. It was fairly easy step-by-step assembly. We have had no breakage or charging problems, but we don't use it very often because of the major traction problem. It does seem to stay charged quite awhile even after long amounts of time in storage. We bought this after a lot of research. These people who think this thing is so great must have flat concrete yards. I have never spent so much money and been so disappointed. 
As Christmas approaches, I thought I would give the counter argument to all of these wonderful reviews about the Gator. I received the gift for my two boys (aged 3 and 5 at the time)2 years ago. Initially the Gator was great. Apart from major traction issues (it is terrible with any type of moistrue on the grass), the guys loved it, and it worked well. After 3-4 months, it began to fail. The gear box started to slip. The windshield cracked clean off. The seat adjusters lost their screws. And a bunch of other stuff. It is a very fragile toy, and that needs to be taken into account for anyone purchasing this for good, hearty kids that like to have a good time, but can be extremely rough on toys. In general, I am a fan of Peg Perego, so that makes this even a greater dissapointment. At the price, I would look elsewhere 
I bought this for my 5 year old in March. After reading all the reviews i figured i was either going to get a lemon or not and i did not. This thing has been run into fences, swingsets, gas meters, the house, sand boxes, trees you name it my kids have pretty much ran into it and im not just talking head on either they have run into poles with the axle and nothing has gone wrong. The battery lasts atleast an hour and a half with around 100 lbs. (3 kids) in it that is riding on a so so slope. My son weights around 40 lbs. and started having problems getting started on a hill because he doesnt have enough weight in the back but figured that if he put it on fast he can get going. The one thing i didnt like was peg perego's website makes it look like the seat slides but you have to take some bolts off to move it, also the instructions is like everyone says took me little over an hour to put together i think the reason is mostly because they are only pictures no words. The fact that this can hold up to 130 lbs. is amazing my children will be able to use this for years. My daughter (2 years old) is starting to drive this now instead of her little 4 wheeler. We have been thinking of getting something else from peg perego for her. Cant really think of anything else im sure im forgetting stuff but i hope this helps with your decision. I never had to contact customer support but from the sounds of it from other reviewers they seem pretty good 
My son received this Gator for Christmas a few years ago. It has provided hours of fun for him and his friends, but I am still disappointed... 1) Tires have lousy traction - slip on grass, snow and dirt 2) Battery is a PAIN to get in and out for charging...the compartment is WAY too small to make this a simple task...it takes about 5-10 minutes, if you put the bar back in too. 3) FRAGILE!!! Totally NOT durable! The windshield snapped clean off, one of the clips on the front grill where you need to change the battery also snapped off, the reverse function broke and we had to order a new part for my husband to fix it...and once it was fixed, a week later the gears totally stripped! I was pretty happy with this toy until my friend got the Power Wheels Grave Digger for her son. The battery pops in and out in 2 seconds, has a charge indicator in the dash of the toy, runs AWESOME on even wet grass, and has more pep than the tractor with 2 kids in it. I'm shopping right now for another ride-on for our son, and I'm going to stick with Power Wheels this time 
I'm jealous! Why didn't we have great ride on toys like this when I was young? We've had this for 3 years and it is still in great shape, runs well, and my daughter has a blast in it 
My 4 1/2 year old son got this for his 3rd birthday and it is still going strong! Even after his uncle put a tow hitch on it and he tows any thing he can, including his sister's Barbie Jeep. He "4x4"'s, slams into things and is just generally very hard on it! Compared to his sister's jeep cousin's ride on toys, the turning radius is the best I have seen, the two front seats are quite roomy and the battery holds better than I expected. It rides on pavement, gravel and grass with ease and with a running start can make it up some decent grassy hills. It is well worth the extra money. The only con I could find is that it isn't big enough for me to drive! 
I bought this doll because my son's name is Aidan. For me, it's just a keep sake for me, and I love it. 
The doll looks very princely and his arms can bend, which is great. That helps my kids put his clothes on. 
THIS IS AN AWESOME DOLL, AND THE SHIPPING WAS FASTER THAN LIGHTENING. WE ORDERED THIS ON A SUNDAY AND GOT IT ON TUESDAY, WOW! MY 5 YEAR OLD JUST LOVES THIS DOLL. SHE PLAYS WITH THIS AND THE PEACH, LAVANDER AND PINK KELLY DOLL AND PONY WITH HER PEGASUS CLOUS CASTLE. PRINCE AIDAN COMPLETED HER SET WITH BARBIE AND PEGASU 
Okay, his lips could use some work. They look a little feminine. But, really, it is just a doll. When he kisses Barbie, no saliva will be exchanged. Get over it. Buy it or don't. Y'all need a bit of "ching, ching, ching...peace..... 
My daughter was really keen for this doll and eventually I relented and bought it. It has proven extremely disapppointing. The expression on the face is quite inane, and it has been quickly relegated to being used as a bit of a patsy toy. the character in Pegasus is flawed, but he isn't stupid. I was annoyed with the crown, he wasn't, after all a Prince - he may have become one, but not during the movie so why put a crown on his head? My daughter really wanted ice skates for him as that is one of the key features of this movie. None of these characters come with skates it seems, yet there is a huge ice skating scene at the start, at least twice in the movie and a lovely double one at the end. I really like that the manufacturers have tried to make the expressions smiling and pleasant however I can't recall Aiden doing it once in the movie. Seems it was designed independently from the movie and without reference to it in looks. On the plus side, the costume stuff is all right and can be used with other dolls. it all seems to be very well sewn and hardwearing 
Aaaghhhh! My eyes! That has got to be the scariest looking guy mattel has ever come up with! His outfit is great, but honestly, I shuddered when I first saw his face 
My husband and I recently purchased this item for our 3-year old daughter, although the toy is recommended for ages 4 and up. Be advised that if your little one is prone to sticking small objects in his or her mouth or if there is a baby in the house then I would probably pass on this product. The pack includes small, button-size "click-in controllers" which can be a choking hazard. In my opinion, the real fun in this toy comes from the rocketpack itself so the small pieces can always be stored away from smaller children. Our daughter could not get enough out of her new rocketpack. She even wore it when she brushed her teeth (well, we did pretend earlier that our bathroom was the moon)! That is another reason I highly recommend this toy because it helps the child use their imagination to the fullest. The pack also includes an activity card with space mission activities which helps aid in their imaginative play. The rocketpack is very durable and has a good amount of storage space. It has even been useful outside of the house. Instead of putting her newly found "treasures" (a.k.a rocks and flowers) into Mommy's pockets, my daughter now has a place for them in her backpack. It's so much fun for our daughter, yet still practical. Your little one can pretend to zoom into space no matter where they are with the Turbo Rocketpack 
The toy looked like it would be made of wood, but it was made from cheap plastic 
Cute Fun and Educational what more could you ask from a toy 
We bought this for our son when he was about 18 months. It only frustrated him that he could not put the blocks together correctly in order to make the animal sounds. So we shelved it. Then at 2 years old, he rediscovered it and loves it! He is so proud that he is able to manipulate the blocks in order to create sound. This is a toy that rewards fine motor skills. And at 2, he is very interested in the various animals their sounds. This is a very high quality toy and I am surprised at some of the negative reviews here. My son has beaten the heck out of these blocks and they are still working just fine. We love this one so much that we just purchased the similar "Transportation" sound blocks - also by Melissa and Doug. Hope this helps, Jod 
We buy lots of Melissa Doug toys and puzzles, but this one was really pretty "cheesy" and definitely not worth the $$. The first one we received was also defective/didn't work. I've seen much better versions so I would shop around 
Great educational puzzle for young children. This is the only toy with batteries that we have in our house. This puzzle is sometimes used in evaluating kids 
My son received these for Christmas and his 1st Birthday. He loves it when he matches up the animals or vehicles and makes them make the sounds. He hasn't mastered it but has more fun with it. And now that he's 2 1/2 he's even more interested in how it works. Although a word of caution. When he was teething he thought these blocks were great to scrape his gums on. Which would have been fine because they are smooth but they have the little rubber dots to contend with. He managed to pop off one and now the ambulance doesn't sound. And he did not swollow the dot (which is easy to have happen). But these are essential cause and effect toys that all children will love. We gave our neice the farm set and she still plays with it daily. Great toy but another little thing to remember with the rubber dots...supervise and count the dots 
I bought this for my boyfriend as he is an avid fan of playing Golden Tee for countless hours at the bar. The actual joystick and game are very similar to the bar version, although the graphics are somewhat reminiscent of Nintendo circa 1990. Regardless, a fun, well priced way to simulate the game in your own home 
I picked this up as I hadn't played golden tee in years, and thought it was a worthwhile 35 bucks. I got it home, played it, enjoyed it with a few people, and still enjoy it with a few people. However, you will get very bored with this, very fast. The game, while the graphics don't really deter me... there is not much differentiation in power levels. Also... if you slice or hook the ball, the game allows you to hit 475+ yard drives consistantly. That may sound amazing, but it gets really boring when you finish a round -24. The trackball is very stiff, and extremely easy to gain full power on. The problem is that this game requires very little finess. It's hit it as hard as you can with the right club. There is only one course, and after you play it with your buddies twice you are bored with it. IT isn't the real golden tee, but hey.. it is 40 bucks. I've bought video games for much more than that with less staying power. If you are a golden tee fanatic, you will probably not enjoy this game. IF you take it as a game away from the real golden tee, then you will enjoy it. Don't expect to be playing this every day, or spending hours and hours mastering it. This game is worth having around, but it is nothing spectacular 
I bought this from Target and wish I hadn't now. The images on the box are deceiving. I think Atari or orginal Nintendo may have had better graphics than this! It's not even close to the game you'd play at the local tavern or bowling alley. What a waste of money, hope you don't waste yours on this too because you will be GREATLY disappointed 
This is sad. A game that had a ton of potential (who doesn't want to play Golden Tee at home?) yet is sorely lacking. I can't believe the Golden Tee people put their brand name to this. Hope someone at the company made a buck off this lousy game cause they sure cheapened their name with this junk. The fact that this game runs off batteries should be a warning sign. It's just plain weak. Complaints: The graphics are lousy, there's only one course, putting looks/plays awful, the trackball is bad, the whole interface is slow, the sound effects seem to be from the era of Pong. It's really really that bad. I don't know why they made this game. Golden Tee has such a cult following that they could have probably charged 100+ bucks for a real trackball console with a bit of memory and a choice of courses w/ good graphics. Something that replicated the full-size game. And I bet people would have bought it, too. Now nobody will trust them when/if they ever do that. [...] I don't even like video games but I was excited by the prospect of this thing. And it totally let me down. I'd give it zero stars if possible 
I WROTE A REVIEW FOR THIS GAME ON TARGET.COM, BUT I JUST WANTED TO ADD ONE MORE NOTE TO MY REVIEW, OR MORESO, THE IMAGE THAT YOU SEE IN THIS AD. LOOK AT THE SCREEN ON THE TV, THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT!!!! WHAT THE GAME LOOKS LIKE. I CONTACTED TARGET.COM TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS FALSE ADVERTISING AND THEY RETURNED MY SHIPPING COST IMMEDIATELY. BUT NONETHELESS, DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE SCREENSHOT, IT IS FROM THE REAL ARCADE GAME, NOT THE PLUG-N-PLAY YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY. LIKE THE OTHER REVIEW, I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING! GO TO THE BAR AND PLAY THE REAL GAME AND SAVE YOUR MONEY, FRUSTRATION, DISAPPOINTMENT, AND THE GAS MONEY TO GO RETURN THE GAME THE NEXT DAY. TRUST ME, YOU WILL 
I had been looking forward to this game for quite some time. I was so happy to finally get the game. After installing the 4 batteries I hooked the game up to my TV and was disappointed before I even started playing. The graphics were horrible and the screen was shaky. Besides the look of the control panel this is nothing like the real game you find in the bars. I am surprised Incredible Technologies was willing to put their name on this product. The trackball is a joke. It barely spins and you can't get any power on your shots. You never see the golfer like you do in the real game and when you are putting you can't adjust for hill, terrain, or anything else. Putting is too easy. There is no way to miss. Driving and fairway shots are unreliable because the weak trackball doesn't respond to what you intend to do. I don't have the money or the room in my place to buy the arcade version so I figured this would be a good substitute. Boy was I wrong. There is no course selection and the course you do play is absolutely boring. I am going to return this unit tomorrow. It is way too frustrating and there is no way to get any enjoyment from this game. I think I am going to head to the bar now, play the real game, and drink until the memory of this cheap imitation is long gone. As I side note: I wish you could give a product 0 stars. It doesn't seem fair that 1 star is the lowest you can go. One star gives this product way too much credit 
this is a really fun piece. bought it for my 6 month old, but my 3 year old is also playing with it. another plus is that it looks nice. the stickers on the wheels (that you see in the picture) came off but i glued them back on. it seems like a sturdy piece. i am happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others 
My 2 year old loves this! It is a great toy for taking long car rides. He received this as a gift last year but he did not actually start to play with it until recently. Mom and dad like it too because it keeps him occupied in the car, wherever our destination is, and at home. Nice toy 
It was my daughter's favorite gift. It was probably the least expensive of all her gifts. She loves to pretend play.. 
I got this for my oldest three children ages 11, 8, and 7 as a gift from Santa along with an opening "balance". The children loved the idea of having to write checks and now when they want something they can write their "bankers"(aka Mom and Dad) a check and we will buy it. So they are learning that once it's spent its gone, so are trying to decide should they save or spend. Since they have no actual money its not burning holes in pockets or getting lost. They are actually thinking about diffrent things and when we say get your check book the re-think the decision about wheather they really want it or not. I'm hoping it not only keeps them from "borrowing" from one another but make sure they really want what they buy, so it's not stuck in the toy chest within the week. Would have given more stars but it's to early to tell how this will work in the long run 
I bought 2 of these cars for my sister's twin boys. They are both around 4 years old and as you can imagine very hard on toys. I have to say they were VERY excited about this car. With a push of the button on the engine it makes several cool sounds and even if you roll the car forward it makes a "revving" or "peeling out" sound. They really liked this. I was a little concerned about the roof opening for accessing to cockpit. It looked prone to break and I did warn them both which the completely ignored and within an hour both tops were popped off. This is actually designed very well and is very easy to pop the roof back on. Seems it is made for young destructive hands. Overall the car is very sturdy, aesthetically pleasing and a great toy. The only downside to this car is it does not come with a Batman figure. Sad the manufacture makes you go out and find a figure separately. Anyway, I was prepared for this and also bought them two Batman Exp figures which they could easily fit in the car. This car was a real hit with the kids and will receive lots of rough play 
My boys (ages 6 and 7 )received this for Christmas and it is awesome!!! It lights up and makes sounds and you can put your Batman figure in the seatbelted seat! Very Cool. My boys really enjoy playing with this in their Batman world! Can't beat the price. Well worth the money and more! 
I adore my Railroad Rush hour, but it has now been taken over by my 7 year old who has discovered he can do the puzzles too. He is up to the intermediate stage and very proud of his problem sovling ability. (As am I) A terrific game to have for relieving boredom, and don't be tricked into thinking it is only for kids[...] 
This is a good mental exercise of spatial reasoning. But that's not all. My 2.5 year old likes to line up the colorful trains. My 4.5 year old likes to set up the board, according to the cards. I enjoy solving the puzzles, and hope my kids will follow suit some day 
Like Rush Hour, Railroad Rush Hour has you "escaping" the traffic jam... this time in the railroad yard, where the traffic can include rail cars and cargo. Rearrange the pieces to get the engine out. 40 challanges included; nylon bag stores pieces when not in use. Larger than Rush Hour pieces makes this puzzle easier to handle for eager young solvers. And with the new pieces, the challanges are all new and different, even for Rush Hour lovers 
This is a fabulous game for people of all ages. Even little kids can play the easy cards. The harder ones can be very engrossing for adults. My son started playing it when he was 4 years old. I have also given it to somebody as a present for their 40th birthday. I recommend it for anybody who wants a bit of a mental challenge 
This is a great puzzle game. Kids learn problem solving and adults practice their own problem solving; all of this brain work is neatly disquised because they are having fun. I wish that Binary Arts would come out with more card sets for their Railroad game like they have for the Rush Hour game. I want extra puzzles! It would make it more rewarding to own 
This game is like rush hour except a heck of a lot better. This game is so much fun. Me and my family sit around it and try to figure out the puzzles 
My son received it for his 9th birthday and it is one of the best presents ever. It keeps him challanged and he gets such a sense of accomplishment when he completes a puzzle. It's also great for travel 
This is a wonderful game. For young kids, its better than Binary Arts's regular "Rush Hour" game because it includes some "junior" level cards, but you'll find even 4-5 year olds can do some of the more advanced puzzles, especially with a bit of help. I play this with my kids, so I can help if they get stuck. This has developed their problem-solving skills like nothing else, and since they love trains it's easy to get them to concentrate 
My initial reaction was, "this stuff is horrible" but that came after my two-year-old threw it all over the family room. Of course, it was my fault for thinking I could leave him under the supervision of his four-year-old brother while I changed my clothes. After the destructive two-year-old went to bed, my four-year-old asked me to play with the Moon Sand with him. A few minutes later, I realized the stuff really wasn't as bad as I first thought. Yes, it's messy, no doubt about it. But on the upside, it vacuums up off of carpeting very, very easily. Moon Sand is not Play Doh. You can't roll it out like you can with Play Doh. And you can't really use cookie cutters to make shapes like you can with Play Doh. I would suggest getting one of the Moon Sand play sets or making sure you have molds to use with it. When using molds, you have to pack it in really tight and kind of tap, squeeze, tap to get it out. And only very gentle pressure will destroy the item you just spent all that time creating -- Moon Sand is very crumbly. I did find it almost therapeutic squeezing it into a big lump then breaking it apart and fluffing it back up. The consistency of this stuff is pretty cool. So, expect a mess and expect it's going to take a little practice to get the hang of it if you -- errrrr, I mean your kids, are used to Play Doh or clay. But, if your children enjoy crafty things or creating things with their hands, they'll probably enjoy Moon Sand 
I was excited to get this for my 10 year old niece but very disappointed that it didn't come with any instructions. It's not intuitive and I had to buy an individual bracelet set just for the instructions 
For starters, the iQuest system is amazing. It makes studying for tests so much easier, and helps you understand stuff you don't get with helpful hints. The cartridges are a must have for an iQuest!!! I have all 3 for 6-8, but math is definiteley my favorite. BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 
The iQuest 6-8 Math cartridge is awesome. My daughter loves it. It makes studying on the road so much easier. She received the iQuest and the Science and Social studies cartridges as a gift. She specifically reqested that we purchase the Math cartridge recently. I find her "playing" the tests all the time. I would definitely recommend this cartirdge, and the iQuest system 
First the play characters looked cheaply made but they are perfect for his hand size. He crawls on the floor still holding the characters. The toy is very colorful. He plays with this toy the most. Plus we like it because is does not make noise. 
My daughter received this from one of her aunt and uncle on her 1st birthday. This became her favorite toy. She loves playing with it and carrying it around. 
My daughter received this for her first birthday and it immediately became her favorite toy. She loved carrying it around the house with the handle and using it to sit on. She's over 2 now and still plays with it. The "people" are fun to stack and she enjoys putting things inside (of course, at first she needed help separating the shapes from the letters). It still gets used on playdates even by the older kids. Great toy 
My daughter loved this when she was 6 months old - opening and closing the red door. And now she's a year and she puts the shapes in, takes them out, puts them in, takes them out. It will be great in another year as she will be able to put the shapes in the correct holes. This toy is a lot less expensive than others but keeps her attention for much longer. We love it 
Few toys in our household have stood the test of time like this one. My toddler and his baby brother both play with it regularly. It functions as both a shape sorter and a prop for imaginative play. 
My 23 month old loves this toy and so do I. It's a shape sorter with shapes and letters. It has four people who sit on top and stack and fit on your fingers. There's an easy to open door to get the blocks out. It can even be played with upside down. It is sturdy and well made. One of my favorite toys 
My 16 month old son loves motorcycles and I looked high and low for a toy motorcycle that is sturdy enough for a child under 3, but still looks like a real motorcycle. Finally, I found the Motorcycle Hauler. Not only, are the motorcycles sturdy, there are 2 of them (one for each hand). My son also likes to push the truck around. The only thing that frustrates him is he cannot put the motorcycles on the flatbed by himself. Something he will be able to do when he gets a little older no doubt. This is a great toy for my son and he enjoys making the motorcycles go vrrrroooomm! Worth every penny. 
I got this toy for my 2 year old grandson as a Christmas gift. The child absolutely loved it and plays with it all the time. My wife and I could not be more pleased with this purchase. 
I bought this toy for my 18 month old (and watched him to make sure he didn't break off the kickstands and eat it). He loved it and played mostly with the motorcycle. He went thru a stage of sitting on the durable trailer and riding it. Now at 27 months he is playing more with combination. It remains one of his favorite toys 
We bought this last Christmas (2004) for my son then 5. It was a huge hit. He loves the fact that he can take the motorcycles off and play with them by themselves. In my house, the platform hauls more than the motorcycles. He uses it to move anything that will on top around the house. Almost a year later it is still one of his favorite toys. It is very durable. It has been dropped, washed, run into walls and furniture and it still is in one piece. A great product and toy for the car/truck/motorcycle lover in your child 
I bought this toy for my 2 year old grandson who loves motorcycles. He has loved playing with it and does so every chance he gets. He plays with the truck by itself and the motorcycles by themselves... 0r all of it together. I love the softer wheels as they don't damage furniture 
My son loves the truck and motorcycles. He can not wait until he gets the other trucks to complete his collection 
My son got this as a Christmas gift just after he turned 2. He is 3.5 now and still loves it! The motorcycles hold up really well, but they can be tricky to put on the flatbed. So, he really plays with them separately. The truck and trailer, however, are his favorite toys and he plays with them all the time. He can get the trailer onto the truck very well on his own and carries his hot wheels around on it all the time. It is virtually indestructible. Buy it for your 2-year-old 
My 2-year-old loves this truck and the motorcycles! It's very durable, and even has endured my toddler trying to ride on it. Love the no-scratch tires too! This is a VERY, VERY nice toy and a great gift idea for any little boy 
My granddaughter loved the pot holder loom. Brought back many memories of myself when I was a child. Goes to show you that the old stand bys are still popular with the kids today. Great service 
I have made at least half a dozen potholders with this quality metal loom. It is easy to use. It is like one I had years ago with a baked on enamel finish. The tines are slightly angled outwards to help hold the loops on while one works with them. Easily recommended to others. Don't buy a plastic one, spend a couple of extra dollars and get metal quality 
This product differs from what I found in the store because the loom is made of metal; those I found in the stores were plastic and I was told would break with use. When I was a little girl, I had the metal loom and made potholders for all my family members for gifts. I wanted my grandchildren to enjoy that same experience. Only a week after Christmas, I got my first new potholder! I am confident that the loom won't break and the children are learning about color and how combinations work together while creating something useful, making them proud 
As a child I made potholders on a loom like this and now my daughters is doing the same. This loom is solid construction, there are plenty of loops of all different colors and the potholders are filling my drawers! 
This doll scares me half to death. It has a very creepy voice and a creepier laugh. It reminds me of a female Chucky and I'm terrified that it might come alive in the middle of the night and kill me. I don't want it in my house anymore, so I'm going to give it to charity and hope my daughter forgets about it 
this item did not work right for us had to send it back. but it is a neat idea for kids 
Hayley works fantastic! If she is not working right, have u thought about exchanging her for a new one. You might have bought a defective one. If she is not working properly then u need to exchange her or know how to work her properly. Try turning the doll on. May times I forgot to turn the inside switch on. The first time the doll is played with I noticed she need to be played with for about 10 minutes before the transmitter was charged. Play with her for awhile and she will give u the right clues. She needs to get charged up. The best way to play with Hayley is if she is out of plain view. Hide her behind a pillow or camouflage Hayley in a messy room or under a blanket or sheet. This is the most exciting way to play with Hayley and the most fun way. Sometimes it depends where u point the antenna. There are 2 buttons on Hayley to turn her on. You have to becareful when u close the back of Hayley's dress you could accidently turn the switch off. Plain simple if Hayley is not working exchange her for a new one or your not working it properly. Make sure the first time u play with her, play with her for 20 minutes no matter what the clues say to charge the transmitter. Then she is fine after that 1st time. Call Kid-riffic before bash an awesome doll. I have never had any problems with any of our Hayley's that we bought. You have to stop, push the button to get a new clue or u are carring around an old message. My girls think they are playing with a real friend. They respond to Hayley as if she were real. My oldest daughter is 10 and absolutly loves her. She said it is the funnest doll she has ever had. Hayley is a 10 star all the way!!!! 
I bought this doll for my 4 year old daughter, and it never worked from the minute it came out of the box. She can be standing on top of it and it stil tells her she is far away! Unortunately, I can't find my receipt to return it, but take it from us - you will be very disappointed. (... 
My daughter BEGGED for this toy for Christmas..and we couldn't find it! Her birthday is early in January and we found one on Amazon. She was THRILLED with this doll. I wouldn't say it is her FAVORITE toy...but she does play with it consistently. She is 6 years old and we felt that she was too old for it at first, which is why we passed on it for Christmas. She wouldn't "let go of the dream" so we found it for her Birthday. It is sometimes a little hard to get the doll to re-set, but seriously...it's a toy!!! You can't expect it to perform miracles. For the price...it's a great doll 
I gave this doll to my niece for Christmas! I was disappointed when I recieved the doll, on how it looked CHEAP! But overall my niece loves to hide her then find her! She works great and my niece really enjoys her 
Don't waste your money or time. Definitely not worth it. You can be standing right next to Hayley and it doesn't seem to find her. My daughter tried it a couple of times and said she wants to return it 
Note to all parents: A group of us parents watched our kids play with Hide-n-Seek Hayley. We had so much fun! You do need to read the instructions though. She needs to be sitting in an upright position to get the best clues. The kids need to play at a slower pace. The kids get so excited running from point A to point Z with the hand held unit that Hayley is trying to register the childs location. If you remind the kids to slow down, stop, look listen you will get the clues and the lights as they are suppose too. The child needs to walk around with the hand held unit, find a location, stand still for a moment and you will get the correct lights and the correct clues. If the child is running all over the place poor little Hayley is constantly trying to register the childs whereabouts. If you tell the child to slow down for Hayley, she is as fun and very exciting as she appears to be. Hayley just needs a few seconds to think and she will work fantastic. This doll is also design well because it is also meant for the children to use their thinking abilities. They have to think OK, I look like a popsicle, what is Hayley trying to tell me? She is saying that I am cold. Hayley say's very encouraging messages. We hide her everywhere, in closets under pillows and my kids and their friends were able to find her. She works great! It was the hit of the sleepover. It made my job easier. Just remind the kids to slow down, and refresh the clue button and have her in a sitting position. If you play with Hayley right she will fulfill all of your expectations. Hayley is an awsome, awsome doll 
I purchased this game for my 12 year old son for Christmas. Since he has no siblings, I am usually his oppponent for all games. This game was challenging for both of us, used strategy as well as luck, moved quickly enough that we stayed interested, and was easy to start playing without having to read a huge amount of rules and instructions. I think it helps with math skills, too, but isn't so difficult that younger players wouldn't enjoy it also. I also like how it stores all pieces into its plastic frame to keep all of the game pieces together. It also has some ideas on how to play a solitare game if you can't find someone to play with. Altogether a great game 
We bought this when our son was 16-months old; he's now 18-months old and loves it, plays with it all the time! I do have to keep my eyes on the balls because they can get lost easy, but it's worth it to see him using the hammer and watching him play. 
My one year old LOVES this toy. She pounds it with all sides of the hammer, as hard as she can and it all stays in tact. It's very strong and entertaining. Needless to say that all kinds of surprise items are chucked into the holes, but easy to remove 
My three year old has always gravitated toward this wherever he's seen it at playgroups, so even though he's three (it's for 12+ months), I got it for him for 'under the tree' at my parents' house and he plays with it daily; was his favorite gift, if you can believe it. It can be noisy, so beware of that part...and also remember these days won't be around for forever, so what's a little noise periodically? The fun he has with it is priceless 
My son started playing with this toy when he was about a year old. I would push the balls and after laughing like a loon and he would chase and hand them back to me. Very good for coordination skills. A short time later he was doing it himself and at 3 he still plays with it when he sees it at playgroup. This toy is a heavy favorite in the toddler room. 
My son got this for his first birthday and has loved it for the past 4 months. He learned very quickly how to place the balls along the top and hit them with the hammer. He squeals while he watches the balls roll through the mirrored maze inside... it's very cute. The only problem I have with it is that he's figured out how to stuff all sorts of small toys into the holes on top, including his fisher price little people animals. They can get into the toy, but I have to take a screwdriver to open the back and get them out. I do wish it unsnapped easier to free trapped toys, but the upside is that it's very durable and hard for a toddler to destroy 
This toy is amazing, my son recieved it for his first birthday. He is now turning 2 and it is STILL one of this favorite toys. Every kid that enters my house plays with this toy. It is very easy they can even hit it with their hand if the hammer isn't around. I did however wonder how i would clean this once some dirt had built up inside...but i solved that easily...i just ran it under the faucet and it cleaned up great. And this toy has been banged around with no cracks at all 
My 3-year old son loves dinosaurs, and as soon as he saw this one in the store, he knew without a doubt that Santa would bring it. We weren't planning on getting it for him, so when we asked if he would be sad if Santa didn't bring it, he replied he wouldn't be, because Santa would DEFINITELY bring it for him. It's all he wanted. I was concerned that it was the type of toy he would play with for maybe an hour or so, then get bored with it, so I was hesitant to get it. But we ended up getting it for him, and since Christmas it's rarely been in a different room than my son. He has plastic dinosaurs, and dinosaur books also, so he always has his favorite T-Rex when he's playing with them. He uses it to eat the other ones or to fight them. My 18-month old steals it every chance he gets because he loves the roaring and motion also. When it's quiet-time, there is a convenient 'off' switch on the foot. It's pretty tough, as it's been dropped and kicked a few times, and works just as good as ever. Overall a great investment, lots of fun for everyone, and has lots of potential to fit into my son's play style 
My son (5) received this for Christmas and it's been a huge hit! My younger son (3) is constanly begging to play with it. My nephew (2) and husband play with it as well. This toy spans all ages. It's much bigger then the regular T-Rex by Imaginext but still has all the same great safety features such as fierce looking teeth without being sharp. The animatronic movements and sounds are pretty cool and justify the pricetag since this toy is rarely left alone. A great addition to the Imaginext prehistoric line. Now all I have to do is buy a couple more. 
This was disappointing. When the phone arrived,it had a nice medium volume.The next day the volume was so low, you could barely hear it,except see the lights blinking.I changed the batteries, but it still did not help.It was a waste, since my grand-daughter's loves phone ringing, and this does not. Giving the benefit of the doubt,my item may be faulty. I threw the box, so could not return it. My advise is" Keep the box and return label" for sometime, incase you encounter the same problem 
We love this phone. It's great that it's in different language 
This is a cute phone, though the voice is slightly obnoxious. The thing that really bothers me is that when you press the moon/pound button, it plays the tune of "This Old Man" in one key (E-flat) while the voice sings it in ANOTHER KEY (B). It's atrocious. And this WILL be your child's favorite button to press, because kids love music, no matter how awful it is 
This is a great toy. Easy for our son to carry around and he loves all the noises the phone makees 
My son loves this phone. There are so many buttons to push and so many different sounds. He gets bored with it just like any other toy, but when he hasn't seen it in a few days he is really excited to play with it again 
My son absolutely LOVES this phone. He loves how it lights up and plays music. He plays with this toy every single day - don't know what I would do without it! And the price it great too - Very durable also 
My granddaughter loves this toy. She loves pushing the buttons and hearing the music 
My 3 1/2 year old got this for Christmas to use in his toy kitchen. It's another well thought out item from Melissa and Doug. We love wooden kitchen toys and this was a great addition. His favorite part was the butter "pats" that have velcro and can be cut off of the "stick" of butter and put on the "toast". We're getting a lot of "soups" with butter in them 
We gave this to our now 4 year old son for Christmas. He played with it for the first day and occasionally gets it out now. However, it has not held his interest like some of the other cooking or wooden toys. My only other complaint would be that if you have a child like mine, the butter might be stuck in. It can be difficult to get out 
Ideal for anyone who likes espionage and fun 
I purchased the Undercover Detective Activity Kit for my eight year old granddaughter. We combined it with a wig, false teeth, and a few other items in a backpack labeled "Lauren's Field Kit." It was such a huge hit with her and all the kids and adults. The uncles made up a crime scene by stealing something of hers and the aunts all helped her follow the clues. It was amazing and she still thinks it's her favorite gift of all times! We did put the fingerprint powder up for special usage as her little brother and sister aren't ready for that and I think neither was mom! 
No directions - these kids have to figure out what these cryptic codes mean without an instruction manual or any indication of what the buttons are for. The kids spent their own money on a cool toy.......they thought- do not buy unless you are a nuclear physicist 
My 8-year old picked this up yesterday, she was very excited. In summary, after about 15 minutes, she was in tears over the thing. Reason being is that she was frustrated with the overall navigation and controls for configuring and setting up the thing. We located the instructions buried in the packaging, and were able to eventually get past it. After configuring, she had the instructions out trying to send messages - she finally was able to do it, but it's not very easy. In addition, the IR is a severe limitation as line of sight must be maintained. This product would be much better if it was RF-based, and was less cryptic in the initial setup, as well as sending a message. For example to send a message, here's process: - Chat Mode button - type message - send button - it then asks for the P/I? which we have no clue what that is - then hit ICQ button Several steps, lots of button pushing, not the most intuitive. Recommend that you do not buy this 
I bought this as a gift for someone else and was embarrassed by how cheap it looked when we opened it. To top it off, the sand in the timer was all glued or stuck together so that the only element of the game which you couldn't make yourself didn't even work. The parts look like they're worth less than a $0.25 and the boards and pieces are ridiculously cheap. They could've at least put an extra nickel or two into the spinner, the key element of the game. As it is, I think a kindergartner could make this game in their arts and crafts hour. I'd recommend traditional word games like Scrabble or Boggle instead of this. 
We got this game for our 6 year old, not knowing what to expect. Turns out that it really challenges her to come up with good words! After a few times, though, we didn't have to use the "adult rules" because (1) she was too good at it now, and (2) it was just as challanging for the adults as the children! Now, my 4 year old has joined in the game. We use a "stripped down" version of the rules for her: Now that she knows phonics, she came come up with a word that begins with one of the letters spun, and then writes down that word. Great practice for the whole family 
This game is clever! It really is loads of fun for kids to play and at the same time (without their conscious knowledge) they are improving their word skills. The game has a spinner, which, off-the-bat makes kids interested. Next, all kids play each round which ensures that nobody has to wait their turn (waiting for their turn in a game to my kids seems like slow torture). Since, they are all playing in each round there is lots of competition to come up with the best and longest word to fit one of six categories (ie. boys or girls name, living creature, food or drink and I can not remember the others). All and All - a smart and fun kids game 
I purchased Wordplay because I am always on the look out for games with an educational dimension. My son (aged 9) seems to have taken quite a liking to it, which is great since he tends to shy away from anything that he says `feels like school'. He loves the spinner in the middle of the game board (a nice touch), and the idea of `spinning to get your letters' (which are then used to form words). The words themselves are left to the child's imagination and vocabulary skills, ensuring that the game remains flexible and interesting. Even when he is not playing with some of his friends, my son sometimes comes up to me and asks that I spin for him (so that he can proudly show me the words he has formed using `my' letters). All in all, very smart. Sometimes the simplest ideas really are the best 
I LOVE Ravensburger Puzzles. They are made to last. My daughter loves puzzles and these pieces are so easy to put together. We love the bright colors and overall quality of this puzzle. I recommend Ravensburger when you buy puzzles 
Bought this for my son who is five years old and loves puzzles - especially Thomas the Tank Engine puzzles. I thought 100 pieces may be too much for him but it wasn't. He loves to figure out how things go together so this was perfect. Great product and would recommend highly. 
We probably have 20 Ravensburger puzzles and my children love doing them over and over. They hold up well and are challenging, yet still engaging. 
Of all the gifts my 2-1/2 yr old grandson recieved for Christmas, he likes plays with Mater the most. He has a very inquisitive nature and loves mechanicle things. This "Cars" toy tow truck is a good choice for this kind of child 
We just love Mater from the movie and this toy brings him home. The rip stick comes out of his engine (his nose) and he then drives backwards. My kids just love him 
I received the toy in exellent condition. All was on time and exactly as shown 
Got this for my nephew. He loved the movie Cars, of course. Also purchased Lightning McQueen. You can't miss with these. He loves them. I remember the rip stick cars from when I was a kid. They are still a winner 
My granddaugter will love all the animals she can create, using this set. She loves the zoo, and there is a great variety of animals in this set. She can even make an "ele-giraffe! 
My kids have 3 or 4 bins this size of Duplos. This particular set was recently given to one of my sons as a gift. It's an especially nice set because of the variety of colors included that you never see in the regular sets. The kids love looking at the pictures and making the animals with these blocks. They also use these blocks for their all-purpose building needs, as well. :) What a wonderful set! You just can't go wrong with Duplos! We have zillions and they are played with by all the kids (ages 2-8) regularly. I'd say our Duplos are the most played-with toy in this house 
My grandson really loves this set. It is of the usual quality Leggo's have been known to be. They are so good to help the dexterity of the little ones 
I love this toy, it is one of my 2.5 yr old's favorite toys to play with. Can't complain about anything. 
I think this is a great toy. I bought this for my 3 1/2 y.o. daughter. She is not able to put the animals together herself but she can fix them and make them with me. My 5 1/2 year old son has been having a great time playing with it as well. He is already adept at lego and yet he finds the animals fun and challenging. You must save the cardboard pictures of the animals that the box is wrapped in so that you can refer to the pictures for building. My two suggestions for Duplo would be that they include a book with pictures of how to build the animals and that they include just a few more pieces so that you can build all of the animals and the refreshment stand. This set allows you to build all the animals but if you want to build the refreshment stand you will have to take a few pieces from an animal or another Duplo set. Overall - I would recommend this toy to anyone with girls or boys ages 3-6. 
My little sister and I love Barbie,My Scene,and Bratz.And ever since this came out,my sister wanted it.It's really expensive though.I mean,65 dollars?But luckly,we got ours at Wal-Mart.But as soon as my parents got it,it went on sale! Fun This toy was very fun.For both me and my sister.It comes with a vanity,bed(for kelly)A table,two chairs,and some pieces of cake and makeup.One thing you should know is that it is quite expensive for both the dolls and the cloud kingdom.All my sister got was the kingdom,Rayla the cloud Queen,and Brietta the Pegusus.But we play with our Bratz andMy scene.It can be for any type. Durability Ok.Everything is nice except for two things: 1.)The bacpart(Cardboard)is not a very good quality 2.)When you are done playing,take the3 pieces apart gently LGP3LN 
My 5 year old daughter loves Barbie and all the Pegasus toys but Could Kingdom provides no stimulation for her and she is disappointed and bored with it. It hasnt captured her attention for more than 5 minutes and she loves to use her imagination. It takes so long to put it together and is not durable. It is expensive for what is provided and there should be more magical lights and buttons to press to make it interesting but its basic a bunch of plastic clouds that take up a lot of space. 
Assembled, this toy is very pretty. Especially when all of the dolls (sold separately) are posed on it. It's VERY cute! However,the design/quality is very poor. Mattel needs to keep in mind that parents sometimes need to relocate or store a toy, and this playset cannot be moved without falling completely apart. It falls apart when it's played with too. Also, the backdrop is made out of cardboard. CARDBOARD! It doesn't attach firmly and keeps falling off. I don't think Mattel bothers to test market their toys with actual children anymore. If they did, they would know this needed more work before release. I guess it's cheaper to rush a toy to market before Christmas than to perfect and produce a quality product. If I had been able to examine one of these playsets before purchasing, I wouldn't have purchased it 
In concept, this is a great toy. In design, however, it has many flaws. The backdrop piece just does not stay attached! (I actually fun-tacked it to the wall behind where Cloud Kingdom sits in my daughter's playroom.) The Clouds pieces, while very pretty, are just not solid enough to hold up. And be sure to make plenty of space for this toy because it takes up 3 feet of room and does not fold away for storage. My 4-year-old does not seem to mind any of this, though. It really does inspire her imaginative play as she flies her pegasi through the sky 
Just for the record, this is the car that got crashed in the first race. It got upside down and finally McQueen jump over its wheels to bypass the other crashed cars 
I am pleased that other people have found this calculator useful. However, I cannot recommend it. I see two major problems with it. The most obvious is the very poor quality of the screen. The lines that make the digits and math symbols are too thin, too light, and very hard to read. I cannot understand why they would make a calculator for young children with such a truly terrible digital display. The cheapest calculator on the rack at the drug store has a better display than this one. The second problem is that it gives the answer to division problems as decimals rather than as remainders. There *are* calculators that give remainders instead of decimals. Such a feature would be suitable for such a calculator as this one, which is clearly designed for the early grades. The concept behind this calculator is a great one. The calculator itself, however, is poorly designed 
The See N Solve Visual Calculator is really useful for helping young ones who are just learning their math skills. To actually see the problem on the screen is very productive to understanding what the child is doing. I, as a grandmom, had a hard time pushing the numbers, but that may be just me, because my grandson has no problem at all. I would recommend this as a gift or an aid to help with math 
I love the fact that this calculator puts the equations in the form they are learning in school. You actually get to see the equation, not just the answer. AND it shows the dividing "bridge" in division, not the dash with dots over/under it. I think it helps my son see the equations in a form that is meaningful because it's how his teacher does it how it is on his homework. He's 6 thinks it is fun to just sit around practice with equations, testing himself before he hits equal for the answer. Glad I bought it 
I purchased this calculator my my special needs child and it has been great. Simple, easy to use and see what she is really doing. I would recommend this item to others 
Wow, did we laugh! We didn't expect the surprise ending, like the other reviewer wrote, to be quite so dramatic. My friends like to play card games like hearts and gin and they loved playing this with us. But this game was funny because of all the cards that had us stealing from each other. What fun 
My family plays this game over and over. It never plays the same way twice and always has a surprise ending. We love playing it with our friends and now our friends want a copy for themselves. 
Item fits well in the seat of the car. The rubber gripped lining prevents it from sliding around, and the surface is easy to damp wipe 
The quality of this table is superb. It is very strong and sturdy. I was tired of wasting my money of poorly made tables. My son is 5YO and slightly tall for his age. He sits at the table with plenty of room for growth. This was a great investment because it will last for many years to come. As mentioned by other reviewers the color of the wood pretty much coordinates with anything 
I purchased this table for my 15 month-old daughter to practice standing and walking now and later, for play and crafts. I work at a Montessori school and this table is as sturdy, heavy and strong as those we purchase for the classrooms from specialized Montessori catalogs at twice the price. I think my daughter will have one this for a very long time. 
This was the best! It arrived in perfect condition and 1,2,3 we had it together. Quality of wood is great. All you need is an electric/battery screw driver and it was a cinch! It's very sturdy and will last a lifetime. 
OK, so this set is a bit more expensive than it's plastic counterparts. And more pricey than Little Tike's other wooden table (the Hudson), but that extra expense is WELL justified! This table (and the matching chairs) are not only beautiful but sturdy as well! The light wood finish compliments all types of decor. The light coating of finish on the table and chairs make clean up a breeze, which is a huge plus in my book! These are sturdy, well made pieces of furniture which your toddler and children can beat up without you worrying about paint chipping. It is perfectly proportioned for young children. My nearly 3 year old daughter, who is 38 inches tall, sits at this table comfortably. Her 6 year old cousin, who is 51 inches tall, also fits at this table comfortably! We would buy from this collection again in a heartbeat and would (and have!) recommend this to anyone looking for a beautiful, sturdy, functional table and chairs set for their little ones 
The reason I'm so THRILLED with this sturdy, wooden set from LIttle Tikes (table and chairs) is that it's smaller than most kids furniture. I was all set to pay big bucks for Pottery Barn Kids stuff, but my (very tall) two year old wasn't big enough for them! He loves doing projects and play doh etc. so we wanted to get him a table. I spied this set behind a bunch of stuff at our local toy store and when he sat on it, VOILA!! It was perfect. It is heavy and sturdy (good for boys) and the natural wood looks great in our home. I also realized that although I lusted after the painted PBK stuff, it will chip and stains will show much quicker than this natural wood. We are VERY pleased with it 
After looking in stores, catalogs and online we decided to order this table for our two year old son. Even though the price was a bit more than I felt we needed to spend it was worth it. The quality is great the legs are thick and sturdy Our son loves it! Of course he loved helping me attach the legs which was simple and after we comvinced him to turn it over he was delighted to belly up with his colors and books. We feel this is a great quality piece that will be easily incoporated into his room as an bedside table or end table after he out grows its current purpose 
my kids are just going crazy over the "webkinz"! This cat was great and it was shipped really fast. The thing I learned recently is you might be able to get them cheaper @ local card stores and Hallmarks. 
I got this tent for around $15 brand new, much cheaper than what I had seen anywhere else. I was prepared to pay around $25. What an awesome deal! Though it is rather large and the colors are not what I would have initially chosen, it does work with the tunnel we already had and my daughter seems to like it. I don't think I'll have any problem getting my $15 worth! 
We are happy with the tent. It is spacious and durable, the kids spend a lot of time playing inside of it and when they are done we can put all the toys inside. They are learning to get most of their things in one place 
This tent works great in and out of the home. Great fortress within the home, or to get baby off the grass and sand outside. It takes up some square feet, but if you have the room, it is fun to play with. Assembly time is probably 5-10 mins for one person. With more use, I'm sure it can be assembled at a faster pace. One side stays open, but can be masked with a sheet or blanket (if you would like your baby to stay inside). My 9 month baby and I easily fit within the tent, with much room to grow. Easy disassembly. This tent does the job of getting baby out of the sun, and great place for naps when out. For this low price, nothing compares. Stows away neatly and easily in a small bag (approx 4x12 inches). 
I had high hopes for this thing. I remember the fun of the old Viewmaster Projector I had as a kid. None of that fun exists here. The slides are hard to look at and trying to get anything resembling focus while wearing the glasses is almost impossible. Get your child a good viewmaster and you'll be glad you did 
I love watching the shows with my brother it is fun and we learn a lot, But there is no 3-D effect! Also I can't find any other slides online for this projector 
This projector is just what everyone above has been saying...useless...Do not go and buy it!! I give it "0" stars. The negatives are very hard to make out. I couldn't tell if I was looking at Earth or Venus 
All of these negative reviews should tell you something! I wish I had bought this at Amazon, so I could've seen these reviews first. They are all correct. There is NO 3D effect at all. In fact, wearing the glasses is a viewing obstruction. We could see the pictures better without them. Also, I don't know if it was my imagination or my frustration, but it seemed that wearing the glasses actually gave me a headache! This would be a much better product if they didn't bother to try to make the images 3D. I too have been looking for slides that will fit into this projector. It wouldn't be bad with plain 2D images 
I agree with the other reviews. My son got this as a Christmas present, and was more interested in the big flashlight aspect of it than the slides. The slides are completely blurry, and there is no 3D effect. I am trying to find other non-3D slides that fit the projector, though, and would like to hear from anyone who might have found some (johncpratt@yahoo.com). If available, they would greatly improve the usefulness of the projector. Otherwise, skip it 
We received this as a gift. It is WORTHLESS. There is little or no 3-D effect. The slides are of little interest 
I bought Darth Tater for my 4 1/2 year old niece who is a huge Darth Vader nut. (She thinks he's cute..strange child). She opened this on Christmas and fell in love with it. Mr. Potatohead is a great toy, in general and I love that they came up with this character 
This was a "gag gift" for my brother in laws 40th birthday party, but it went to "toys for tots" for Christmas afterwards and what a great thing to do with it!! 
Just need to say that I have this baby at my office and everyone loves it! Some of my friends liked it so much that they even got to buy their own. Star Wars Unleashed it ain't, but it's a nice toy for geeks like me 
My kids are two of the biggest Store Wars fans out there, so this toy was a no-brainer for me. When I saw it listed here at Amazon I was thrilled. Christmas Day came and I was an instant hero! Darth Tater is just the cutest thing, and it even has a little cape for him to wear. Cute, cute. Just needs a little Cuke Skywalker to play with in the future (hint, hint) 
We got the Darth Tater for our 5 yr old daughter wen we went to the Disney Star Wars Weekend. It was a "gift from Mickey" that she got one morning (her 9 yr old cousin got the Spud Trooper). It was great, and they immediately loved them. While at Disney MGM we stopped in the one toy story themed store to get exclusive Disney parks potato parts (fill a box for $10). When we got home, there was the other potato waiting as a "GFM". Now when her friends come over they have 2 potatoes and some hillarious disney park only pieces. The little mermaid battles a spud tropper bearing a cinderella slipper. This is a great toy for the young kids because it is for the 3+ crowd but mom and dad get a hoot from playing with the potatoes too! Now we are just rying to find the R2Potat2 
This happens to be one of my favorite toys (I collect toys). It is so cute it's outragous-whenever I see it, I can't help but smile. I keep Darth Tater up on top of my left audio speaker tower, and he's one of the first things you see when entering my living room. This is a great toy concept, and for those of us who have never forgotten our potato head days, this will bring them back with a smile. Very easy to put together, but I would NOT buy it for a small child, as there are some smallish plastic parts that they might swallow=very definitely a toy for us scifi/emorabilia lovers. Honey, I remember when the first Tater Heads came out, you had to stick the plastic parts into a REAL potato! So this all-plastic version is a VERY pleasant update. This would make a great office toy......I give this five smilies up!!! :- 
Very cute and very fun desk accessory! We are big Star Wars fans and this is a perfect addition to the collection. You cannot be in a bad mood while looking at Tater Vader (as we fondly call him). : 
I am already in my 30s and I still felt so joyful when I finally laid my hands on it! First time I knew about Darth Tater is at work, reviewing advertising reels (I work in advertising), and I just flipped when I saw the ad for Darth Tater. I just knew I had to have it! It's going to sit proudly on my desk - weak-minded Jedi beware 
My husband received this for a gag present, and my 3 year old daughter loves it. It's by far her favorite of her Mr. Potato head collection, along with Spudtrooper. I'm not sure if it's the lightsaber or the cape, but something about this toy captivates her. If you're a Mr. Potato Head fan, whether young or old, this is a must have. We're looking forward to adding Artoo-Potatoo to the family when he's available also. : 
Yes, The Big kids will love that you remember them and remember them with a Star Wars kitsch type toy!!!! It is a bedroom delight for the eye that collects grins and dust!!! 
I bought this game during a vacation and we had such fun playing it on the road back home. You get 5 cards which have a headline word on it like "Man" and "Blonde". You are able to trade your words out once (up to 3). Each card has a point value on it. You want to create the best headline possible to make the most points. Headlines must make sense and be possible. Lots of fun 
My almost 5 year old son loves driving his Jeep all over the neighborhood. Because of the better handling and wheel design (not slanted), the Jeep is remarkably agile. What my kid has done so far: - Taken the Jeep off road on bike trails - Drive through iced dirt - Drive through 1/2" mud - Drive through 1/4" water puddles - Pull passengers on a tied on Wagon (We almost died laughing) I agree with the previous reviewer that the car is a bit big for a sub 3 year old, but my younger one (2.5) loves being the passenger. 
Bought this for our 2.5 year old son, it's a bit big for him now, but we figure by age 3 (summer time), it will be just fine. lots of power, and nice features just right for a little guy. Our son likes the removable engine panel in the front and has found it a perfect place to hide toys and the like. Have not had it in the grass or any other areas where the "ultimate traction" claim could be tested, but from what we have seen indoors one could easily believe that this will make a difference. One final note, make sure you check the dimensions on this before ordering. it's very large but we recommend it 
My son has just started liking baseball cards. This is enough to keep him busy for awhile. He is still sorting them from Christmas 
Got it about three days after I suibmitted my order. I was very pleased 
When you first realize the 2006 Topps Baseball Card set has 659 cards in it, numbered 1-660, you are probably thinking you know which card is the missing card. That is because in the wake of Mickey Mantle's death several years ago Topps decided to honor the Mick by retiring card #7. Today we say that the modern era of baseball cards begins with the 1952 Topps set, for which Mantle's card is the biggie, not just because it is his Topps rookie card but also because it was a high number from the 1952 set, which jumps the value way up as well. However, there actually is a card #7 in the 2006 Topps set, and it is of Mickey Mantle. What is kind of cool about the card is that it is just like all of the other cards in the set and there is nothing that distinguishes the fact the Mick is no longer active except for his career stats ending in 1968 (he stole six bases in his final season on those ruined legs). The card that is missing is #297, Alex Gordon, who turned out not to meet the new gold standard for having a rookie card. There are some cut out versions of the card floating around out there is you want to have a really complete Series 1 collection (as opposed to have four incomplete collections for about the same price). An intact version sold for $7,000 because clearly it is the rarest card around this year. Topps had to do the cut outs because under Major League Baseball Players Association rules the former University of Nebraska star, who was the second pick in last year's draft, did not sign a contract until September. After years of having baseball cards of players who never spend a day in the Major Leagues, the MLPA changed the rules so that rookie cards can now only be put out for players who make the 25-man opening-day roster or played in at least one major league game the year before. Topps anticipated Gordon would make the Royals' 25-man roster, but the third baseman was assigned to Wichita instead. Then again, when you get the complete factory set you get the 659 cards plus five exclusive bonus rookie cards, so now you are up to 664 and the deficit is more than made up. That solves the mystery of the missing card for the 2006 Topps set. Personally, I think this rule change is great, because I like to see who was playing with each team each year. Granted, that is difficult today because this set already has Johnny Damon with the Yankees (#185), but Coco Crisp (#12) is still an Indian and not Damon's replacement with the Red Sox. Tom Gordon (#163) appears as a Phillie in the photo and on the back, but his card still says Yankee and Matt Morris (#238) is seen as a Cardinal on the front of his card with the Giants. The main thing is that when you get to the rookies, cards 296-325 in Series 1 and #616-45 in Series 2 (with Jason Papelbon, #355, one of two exceptions), you will actually find players who are in the major leagues right now, including the prohibitive favorite for the American League Rookie of the Year Award, Francisco Liriano (#309) of the Twins. This beats going back a couple of years and looking at all of the rookie cards and finding only a handful have made it to the show this many years down the road. The Topps set remains THE set for me each year because it is the one with history behind it, so if you feel the same way it is a must have for your collection. Cards #243-59 are the American and National League Gold Glove Award winners, a set that is missing the A.L. Catcher, who was not I-Rod but Jason Veritek, who does not have a Topps card again this year. We then have the award winners in the two leagues for the Cy Young, Most Valuable Player, and Rookie of the Year awards (#260-65), followed by the Team Cards/Managers (#266-95, 586-615). What they are doing here is interesting, because they have the teams arranged alphabetically from the Arizona Diamondbacks to the Washington Nationals, and what you have hear is the manager card or the team card for each, but never both (e.g., you get Mets manager Willie Randolph and the New York Yankees team card). In Series 2, you will find the appropriate counterparts. There are Team Stars in both series. It is interesting to me that with both Series 1 and Series 2 when you look at the three checklist cards for each the cards for the series end on the front of the second checklist card. The rest of the checklists are devoted to the insert cards available. For Series 2 they list seven Trading Places Autographs and Trading Places Autographed Relics each, 27 Trading Places Relics, 20 Trading Places cards, 40 Signers of the Constitution, 31 Signers of the Constitution Cut Signatures (includes Franklin, Hamilton, Madison and Washington), 30 Hit Parade cards, 15 Topps Stars, 100 Mantle Home Run History cards ("MHR2-MHR101), 100 Mantle Home Run relics, 18 Walmart Cards, 15 Opening Day relics, and 15 Opening Day Inserts. For me the Trading Places and Hit Parade cards are of interest, because they are sort of basic and reflect what actually happened in the 2006 season, but the rest surely takes us into the realm of glorious excess. No wonder I am a "buy the complete series" rather than "tear open a hundred packs" sort of person, because I really do not want to be in the position of hoping for an autograph of Roger Sherman rather than Billy Wagner (or visa versa). Topps is the one baseball card set I get each year because of the history of the company and not because of the extras 
This is great for older kids and adults. Too powerful for little ones 
What can you say about an engine who manages to get cheerful little Toby mad at her! Mavis is a young, feisty diesel whose inexperience frequently gets her into trouble. That said, she *is* learning; and certainly after she shows her usefulness, she becomes one of the crew. (Even though she is a Diesel they don't hold that against her.) Like all of Thomas' friends Mavis is sturdy and a great pal. She is also very useful in the development of 'made up' Thomas tales. In appearance Mavis is black with the yellow markings around her square face. In addition, and for reasons unexplained, she has sidebars and a cow catcher which is certainly not standard quarry attire. It does mean, however, that she can substitute on Toby's line from time to time. Four stars. Mavis is a nice, second-string engine 
If your child enjoys acting out the Thomas Friends episodes, Mavis is a black diesel engine with yellow stripes around her face who works in Toby's quarry. At first, the quarry manager would not let Mavis go out much, but when she saved Toby from falling off a bridge, the quarry manager decided to give her a second chance. She and Toby are now best pals and work together to get the troublesome trucks in shape at the quarry. To expand the fun of Mavis, you can get the quarry mine tunnel and send Mavis for the ride of her life. If you need an engine to help Toby with the work in the quarry, I recommend getting Mavis 
I was just looking at my 8 year old Mavis and I relized it only has four wheels. The one in the picture has 6 wheels. Of course Salty in the picture has eight wheels and our Salty has six but that made me wonder. Because of Mavis's sideplates she doesn't run very well but my little sister loves her anyway. I wish they'd make the magnets like the take along Thomas magnets that u can connect both ways but I guess we can't have everything 
Mavis is a diesel engine that works in the Sodor quarry. She sometimes is too independent for her own good. Mavis has sleek black paint, a cowcatcher, and buffers around her wheels. Her smiling face will be sure to brighten up your child's playtime. Choose Mavis or any of the fun Thomas products. They're great 
We had planned on getting one of these houses for our daughters 6 3 to share but Toys R Us had them b1g1 in October so they each got one for Christmas. I am amazed at the detail put into these houses. They look great and are really durable. We bought about 6 rooms worth of furniture and there are still at least a dozen more playsets they can get to go with it. The girls love it and it really gives them a chance to use their imagination 
My six-year-old daughter received it as a Christmas gift and absolutely LOVES playing with it! Everyone else in the family loves playing with it too, including her older brother. Hers came with the Mom, Dad, twins (one boy, one girl), an older sister, a cat, and some furniture. She also received some of the furniture as gifts, and it definitely helps to have them when playing with the house. The dollhouse is really easy to store because the sides can fold up when playtime is done! One drawback to the dollhouse is that the rooms are small, so if you have a lot of the furniture for the dollhouse, not all of the pieces will fit in the rooms. However, there are creative ways to play with all of the furniture. I would definitely recommend this as a dollhouse to purchase for a child who is five or older 
I bought this house for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter for Christmas. I can honestly say it is the best money ever spent. I even got it at a great price during toys r us' by one get one free event last October. A friend and I were both getting them for our daughters so we got a great deal! Anyway.. she has played with this for several hours every single day since she got it. The only negative I can say about it is that sometimes it is hard to get her away from it so we can go places and sometimes she wants me to play a little too much! 
I was surprised by how enchanted my daughter is by this house because she is hard buy for. Most of the toys I think she will love sit collecting dust. She is four years old and I chose to buy her a doll house for Xmas this year because I remember loving my doll house so much when I was about her age. I also owned a Fisher Price doll house, so I wasn't turned off by all the plastic. I have to admit that I was disappointed by how cheaply made the house seemed to be when we pulled it out of the box, but after two weeks (and her twin baby sisters getting into it every chance they get) it is holding up well. Yes, the twin time doll house is right up our ally! I love how it mimics our real life family so well (with the exception of hair color, the twin boy, and the pink decor). I especially like the furniture sets, they are attractive, interesting to play with, and seem well made. It is a drag that everything has to be bought separately. More corporate greed I assume. The house should at least include the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and family room. The rest of the rooms could be optional. What is up with the silly little kitchen sink and cheapo furniture that comes with it? At least have the decency to lower the cost an additional ten bucks and have the house empty. With the exception of the baby cribs, these items do not get played with once the "nice" furniture arrives. I bought her doll house at Walmart, so it came with the big sister and her bedroom set, which was a nice addition. Family members bought her the kitchen, bathroom, laundry room, family room, and dinning room. I think it would be nice to have the parents bedroom, too. The house is certainly too small to accommodate all of the furniture sets. I would prefer to have a house that doesn't fold but has larger rooms. I question how well this house would hold up if it is constantly being folded up. My other recommendation to Fisher Price is to add a stair case. My doll house had a winding black stair case and that was definitely a fun feature. Overall I like the house, but I think it could use some tweaking. 
This Fisher Price Loving Family Twin Time Dollhouse is a favorite of my 3 1/2 year old daughter. We gave it to her last Christmas and she took right to it - especially since she has twin brothers (5 1/2 years old)! The dolls and furniture are the perfect size for her little hands to maneuver in and around the dollhouse. I suggest getting as many family members as you can - especially if you have extended members (ie grandparents, siblings, babysitters, older cousins, etc) like we do that play a big part in our daughter's life. This makes for really fun pretend play! The African-American family is a wonderful addition to promote diversity as well as the SUV for the family to buzz around the neighborhood (read: playroom)! Some of the furniture makes "real life" sounds with moving parts. This helps in making this dollhouse more realistic! This Christmas we'll be adding the Backyard Cabana and Laundry Room 
I gave this five stars because my four year old daughter absolutely loves this dollhouse! In my opinion the rooms are small but she thinks they are perfect. The house itself is not too big nor is it too small. Perfect for little hands. What would be nice is if Fisher Price would come out with an add on. So much furniture but not enough rooms. Every time a new set comes out, we buy it.....we really need a bigger house! All in all this was the best purchase I have made in a long time. 
This house is great! Adorable and beautiful. It even looks good in my daughter's room. I think it was difficult to get the furniture during and after the holidays but now they are easy to get. My sister bought the house for my 2 1/2 year old daughter, Peyton. She also bought all the furniture for her except for the nursery because she has the two cradles and the highchair and there's no more room in the room, and the family room, because they have the living room already. The two chairs that came with the house are for the breakfast bar that also came with the house. They aren't dining chairs. I think they just gave a little furniture because they obviously want you to spend the money to purchase more. Yes the rooms are small. I wish they were bigger too, but I don't think my daughter notices so much. She just likes playing with it. Although I will admit she uses my coffee table as the kitchen and my ottoman as the parents' room. The furniture is adorable! Lots of cute fabric and accessories! I have a 9 month old so I put all the small pieces away. I don't think my 2 year old would appreciate them that much anyway. There are some accessories that are tied to the furniture with strings. Good idea for someone her age and since I have another baby I'm glad. I will cut those off for her when she is older and so is the baby, if she cares enough by then. We have the kitchen, bathroom, parents' room, girl's room, dining room, living room and laundry room. I haven't taken out the dining room and laundry room yet because the kids room is where the dining room should be. There is another room downstairs for the laundry room but I think that set seems a little old for my daughter. She doesn't know what a laundry room is because ours is in our basement. This house can't really hold all the furniture available unless you use the "terraces". I also bought the blonde mommy (as a babysitter, aunt or older sister) because I wanted the little girl and it came as a set. The only other set I really want is the SUV. I have to admit that I am living vicariously through my daughter because I would have loved this dollhouse when I was a little girl. I think that's why my sister bought it for her too! It's a beautiful house and I think well worth the money, especially since it wasn't my money! lol. It's probably not for anyone older than ten years old. I can see how it would be frustrating for them. 
I love this toy. My baby cousin who is 21 months old was over and just played with it. Nothing ever kepps her busy for over 10 min. but this toy did. The toys are very hard to find 
I am so glad i got this gift for my husband. We and our friends have played this game over and over again. I just love it. The rules are sometimes not specific but we just make house rules to cover any questions. We enjoy it so much we wish that it was larger so that more than 4 people could play. Great buy! 
If you like games, this one is pretty good. It is easy enough for kids, but fun for adults too. The rules are somewhat vague, but pirates don't really need rules, do they? I mean, they are more like guidelines than actual rules. 
I bought this game for my 15 year old for christmas and she loves it. It has different levels and modes of play and lots of interesting pirate lore. Every game is just a little different so it isn't just going around the same game board again and again. The playing pieces are made of metal, the dice are wood, and the treasures gleam enticingly. The cloth playing "board" has the look and feel of an old world chart. Playing the game is fun because you never know what turn the dice will take, and what fate the seas have in store for you. This game is perfect for pirate enthusiasts, young and old 
We received on of these as a gift and enjoy playing it. The box and pieces are very well made and could be left out on a bookshelf. It is not, however, a really challenging game, but fun nonetheless. We did like it enough to buy it for another game lover as a gift 
We thought this game was a bit pricey, but you get a much better-made game than plastic-and-cardboard ones for nearly the same price. Glass 'jewels', metal dubloons, metal ships, velvet purses, and a cloth gameboard all stored in a very well-made wooden bookshelf case with a strong magnetic latch. The game play is not limited to a preset course or path, but up to the player to determine direction and route. Treasures can be gathered by raiding, trading, or attacking other players. Extra powers are received by becoming the "Dread Pirate," but this can be lost in combat with another player. The rulebook includes basic rules and advanced variations to keep play interesting. Like all games, die rolls and luck can sometimes play a large part but that always changes. I expect that it will eventually become monotonous, but long after most other games would have become excrutiatingly boring. Rules are easy to alter (such as more or fewer jewels to gather) to experiment with other variations and keep it interesting. Bottom line: Much more - in both fun and (especially) quality - than other games of the same price. We have had no 'buyer's regret' from purchasing this game at all. Top-notch all the way; we could (and have) gotten far less for the same price. Highly recommended 
This game is of the highest quality and we were quite pleased with every aspect of it. The wooden dice, pewter ships, velvet treasure bags, cloth map, plastic gems and hefty metal doubloons...everything is just so "neat". We all enjoyed checking out the details of it all. As far as the gameplay goes, I don't understand why some people would have a problem with the dice rolls. That is one aspect of the game play we truly enjoy. It is exciting to try to outroll your fellow players, if you're lucky enough to be the dread pirate you get to add +1 to your roll, and it brings some educational value to the game. Another part of the game that we found both educational and fun was the cards that come into play when you land on certain spaces of the map. The cards have directions for you to follow, and they also have tidbits of historical facts on them. Our entire family loves this game, it is enjoyable for all ages, from our 5 year old all the way up to us 36 year olds. It is very easy to learn to play, even for the younger children. There are basic game rules and there are also advanced rules for the older crowd who've gotten used to the gameplay the first few times around. I highly recommend this game to those who are looking for family games that are both educational and entertaining. I also recommend it to those who are fans of all things pirate. 
I usually hate games like this such as Settlers, Risk, etc. But this game was absolutely wonderful! My friends and I had an amazing time playing this game. It was so much fun. The game has a little something for everyone. The set-up is very cool, cloth gameboard, nice and sturdy game pieces. You also learn sweet pirate facts in the Lore and More on the cards. It is easy to understand and play, not too complicated. It is fun, because there is a lot of chance (dice determines a lot) and you can go from having no money to dominating the board. Very fun, I would recommend it to anyone. 
After reading all the negative reviews, I was hesitant to buy this toy for my son. but he really wanted it, and everytime he saw the commercial he went nuts!! I bought it in September and put it away for Christmas. He talked about this thing almost everyday! Finally on Christmas morning, he discovered that Santa left it for him. It didn't require much assembly, Just sliding ramps onto the croc. Our Crazy Croc works perfectly 7 out of 10 times. It's good for him to see that things don't work exactly the same every time. We have a great time with it. The noises it makes are pretty cool, it burps and laughs and says a few phrases, but thankfully it can be shut off. My 3 1/2 year old LOVES it. The key is to make sure everything is lined up, and to find a car that fits it. We have about 50 different cars, and most of them fit. He has his favorites, and most of them fit. Not every car has to fit, Isn't that the beauty of the world? That everything is different, works different and gives different results for different people? I'm certainly glad we got it! 
I got this for my grandson (6) who wanted it because of the commercials. As stated by most of the other reviewers, it just doesn't work. Everyone who bought it should be able to get their money back, or Mattel should send each one a free car that will work. It's a piece of junk. The Terrordactyl works very well, but you'd be crazy to buy the crazy croc. Maybe we should all send them back to the Company with out complaints. 
We bought this croc for our son (5) who loves anything Hot Wheels and found that most of the cars don't work with this. Also, the sounds are annoying to the point of my son wanting it to stop.. which is very rare. Half of the time the crocs mouth won't drop shut, and I agree with one of the other reviews saying that it's nearly impossible to get the car in the boat. We tried and tried and got it in there once. Most of the time the car never even made it to the boat because it flipped over after dropping from the crocs mouth. Amazon is correct in charging only $5 for this toy, it's not worth any more than that. 
My son and neighbor kid were totally caught up in Mattel's ad. Everybody else on-line is out of stock. Amazon's price is unbeatable - WOW!! - [....]. Sam just got it in the mail. Perfect pre-Christmas gift. I know the above sounds indulgent but he loves hotwheels - all types of cars. The Croc is tricky. Yes - the sound can be turned off. Works best with the 1987 Camaro. 
I got this for my daughter and she has really enjoyed it. It came in about 5 pieces that weren't hard to put together, but you did have to make sure they were snapped together well. The little head came off the first time she played with it, but I found that I hadn't pushed it together hard enough. It hasn't fallen off again, yet. It is made for the Little Mommy dolls, which are 14" long and they work well with it. It even has a place behind the ears for the doll's hands to hold on. For the price, I thought it was a good deal 
This set is great for the age range, as it has various activities for different physical levels. We know we'll get several years' use out of it. It was really difficult to put together, but feels very sturdy and well-made regardless 
We bought this for our 2 year old little boy and he absolutely loves it. He really likes the tunnel and tall slide. He also likes to pretend with the steering wheel. My husband was more than a little frustrated at times while assembling it but after it was all said and done he was happy to see that our little guy loves it. We also got a free sand box which our son also enjoys. 
I have always liked Little Tykes stuff anyway, and this slide is definitely no exception in quality, durability and enjoyability!!! I have 22 month old twin boys and they love it. They love the slide, the tunnel, the little footholds on either side to climb up and down, and they also love to jump up and down together holding onto the rails on the top! The steering wheel is also fun. They roll all their cars down both slides, even their huge cars (another plus about this slide is that it's wide!!!!) and the long slide is super fast. It's great. Well worth the money. We've only had this thing for a month now, but I think they'll play with this for years 
We have two boys ages 3 and 20 months. They have throughly enjoyed this toy. It took my husband and I only 1 hour to assemble. My older son enjoyes the higher slide while my yonger son enjoyes the lower slide. They also love hiding underneath. It is very durable and well made. I know that our boys will enjoy this for years to come. 
Good toy. Soft, cuddly, well made. My kids love the Webkinz and the website. They are very happy with the cocker spaniel toy 
Webkinz Pets are an excellent choice for a child who wants to use the internet and a parent who values internet safety. The pets are adorable and my children are addicted! Fun for parents too! 
I just got webkinz for my kid last week. He loves his puppy webkinz very much. However, this website keeps all kids hooked on. What bothers me the most is some pop-up games that allure him to play to keep coming back webkinz site daily in order to earn kinz kash (virtual money of this website). One of the gimmick that this website entices your kid addicts to them is similar to gambling websites, and they really do have a game that no different from the slot machine!! This makes my jaw drop seeing what he is playing!! I couldn't believe it!! Beware your kid might be learning how to play a slot machine at the very early age when you let them enter webkinz website unsupervised!! My wife need to pull him out and tell him that this is not good for kid to play something like a slot machine or gambling-like games, even though it's originate from the webkinz website. Please make sure that parents always have to supervise your kids when you let play webkinz online. This website is not 100% safe for kids. They seem to have a hidden agenda in alluring your kids to become addicted to their games and their sites in order to make sure that your kids will keep their membership once their first yr member expires. Some (or Most) of their games are non-educating games and really not much different from the gambling websites. This webkinz website is not safe for kids. Beware of addiction, and crave for earning more kinz kash which makes it indifferent from gambling websites 
This webkinz is he same kind of dog I have. I like this webkin because you get to go know the enternet and by them food,rooms,toys,games and beds. Then you click on things to do and you will see things like arcade,wshop,myroom and stuff like that well got to go so bye bye 
My daughter tried to set up her account and it said her code was already in use. In other word, someone probably stole her code. So no costumer service help for a month now. Still waiting for a return phone call. All I got from email was the run around. I have a HUGE family. This is something I would have gladly given as gifts and recommendations because I know it would be fun. But now I feel totally dissed! They took my business and then pooped on it 
I purchased this for my [...] year old for christmas and we love it. I am always looking for fun educational things for her to do on the computer and this is a gem. Once you purchase the stuffed pet of your choice you register it online and a virtual version of that pet appears on the computer. The kids can earn money playing games etc. They then can build rooms in the house for there pet, take him to the doctor,go shopping etc. In this world of computer dangers this item is excellent and great fun for her, We love it 
This cute little guy was a big hit on Christmas morning. He arrived early and was packaged well 
Even though the Webkinz toy website were fun for my daughter, we lost the tag and have tried contacting customer service for TWO MONTHS!!! No response by emailing through our email, their website or calling. WHY do they say you have to be 14 years or older to call, if no-one is answering the calls anyway!!! I don't plan to buy another, or suggest anyone else buy one either, until they can improve their customer service. What a kick in the face!!! 
I just received these blocks today and love them. However I was alittle concerned after reading about the quality of the blocks in the previous review .I run a daycare and purchased three sets each set is very well made and are easily stackable, in fact I am ordering two more sets 
I first used these blocks in a pre-school classroom. I have searched everywhere for them so that I could purchase a set for my two daughters to have at home. Hooray for Amazon! These blocks offer hours of fun, are safe, and easy to wipe clean. Kids love to build pretend villages, furniture and large towers, and if they tumble no-one gets hurt 
As far as toys go, this is by far one of my favorite buys, the overall set is huge, far bigger than I expected. The sculpts for both figures are top notch. Highly recommended for any horror fans, a must for a Halloween fan 
This set can certainly be used as a toy for kids. However, its real purpose is more decorative than functional. It is designed for display by hardcore Halloween and horror fans. In that regard, it is outstanding. Michael Myers looks just about as I'd picture him from the first two movies. However, I am really impressed with what they did with Dr. Loomis. Loomis is the sort of guy who, if you don't get the likeness right, can easily come out looking like Lenin. The figure looks about as good as something in this size range can look. The other features are quite good, as well. The steps and the surroundings are attractive. (They do screw you out of the shrubs that are pictured on the box, however.) Overall, I thought this was beautifully done. The effect is quite authentic. Everything looks just as one would hope. I hope they eventually create more of these, to commemorate the later films, as well. (I personally would pay heavily to see Loomis released featuring his 2by4 from part 5.) If they do make another one, they'll have a hard time topping this one 
This is the best halloween toy to own!Very big when put together the size of box is very misleading!Detail is the name of the game here people that see it are amazed with it.You can place fallen leafs and tree branches were u want them to be the pumpkin lighting up is also a creepy feature.If you are a halloween fan i would strongly advise picking this item up for your collection well worth the cost!!!!!!!The night he came hom 
The only difficulty I have with this as a bath toy is that sometimes the water doesn't drain out of the jet ski as quickly as I would like. My 2-year old son loves it, though and plays with it every night in the bath tub. He's a huge Diego fan 
I bought this item for my three-year old grandson to add to another set. He really likes it since he is a big Diego fan. It provides many opportunities to imagine he is an animal rescuer 
We love this game! Our 2 1/2 year old twins are even able to play by themselves. It's a great way to bring some fun to those cold days when we can't be outside. And the box makes taking the game with us so easy! 
This game is really great and I highly recommend it. My 3-yr old girl and my 7-yr old boy both really enjoy it. Even though my daughter doesn't know all the characters, she can search by color and match the pictures on her bingo card to the pictures on the screen. Because it's random anyone can win which, of course, the kids love. This is also great for grandparents who know nothing about Nickelodeon characters and want a fun, low-key game to play. Spongebob does a little video tutorial in the beginning, so there are no difficult instructions to understand. That also means it takes just a couple of minutes before you're actually playing. There are little montages throughout (like 2-min. shorts) featuring various characters to keep their attention. We can and will play this again and again. They should come up with a version with magnetized chips so we can play in the car 
With two young boys who are always looking to play their video games, this game allowed FUN for the whole family! The game runs very quickly and is entertaining. It kept everyone's attention and even my husband and I had fun. The only way you cannot have fun is if you don't like Bingo to begin with 
Quite a few reviews compared ZOOB to Legos which is to compare apples to oranges. I have been a major Lego fan since I could assemble two blocks, and have already purchased sets for my son, but Legos are more about building buildings, boats, man-made things in general, whereas ZOOB is much more organic allowing you to create living movable things such as dinosaurs, spiders, snakes, creatures of all shapes, including the primordial. You can also build cars and motorcycles, but the point is this toy is more for building singular objects rather than the cities and villages I used to build with Legos. The toy is sturdy if handled properly. It has been entertaining for the adults and children in our family 
This toy was suggested by my son's physical therapist to help him improve his wrist strength (writing problems). He has a lot of building toys but this one works the wrist more and is super fun. He has made dozens of different vehicles and contraptions with it and really likes it. I would recommend any Zoobs, but the Car Designer Set was real hit 
I think that the zoob racer set is really cool. I like it cause you can build stuff relly cool out of it. I have built a submarine, flying machine, racer car that can fly, and some things from the book. I was really fun, and I want to get more of this stuff. I really want to try the remote control one, maybe I'll get it for my birthday or christmas. I think other people should get it. I really like doing this toy with Mom and Da 
Zoob is a great product! Fun and colorful. Easy to follow directions. Fun to create your own stuff, my kids make robots (or something they call robots.) Easy to put together, stay together well and come apart when needed. This is a great toy for a child or adult who likes to create and build. My boys are 7 and 4-1/2 and they play with this together 
we got Zoobs years ago and we love them but we couldnt find them anywhere!!! the ones we had bought our kids were breaking from all the use i saw these and didnt think twice about getting them!! my kids make all kinds if things not just the things in the books!! 
Zoob car design works with other Zoob pieces to allow for so many possibilities. Loads of fun, and I think the age recommendation is right on. My 4-yr-old needed a little help with this one the first couple of times. This toy does take a beating as the monster trucks fly down the steps and into walls without a broken piece to date 
My "not quite four year old" received this product as a Christmas gift. He loves building toys, and loves cars, and enjoys putting together toy cars. This is easy for a four year old to manipulate, but allows a child to create his or her own designs. It works in a manner similar to K'Nex, but the pieces are easier to snap together, and therefore less frustrating 
I love ZOOB toys for so many reasons. My sons play quietly for long periods of time, happily being creative and building the most amazing things. We give sets as gifts as often as possible and I am always surprised at how many people are not familiar with the line. The pieces (there are 5 different shapes which are different colors so that one can keep them straight) connect 20 diiferent ways and give you endless possibilities for building fun. It also allows you to make moveable creations (unlike many other building sets). The pieces are very durable. My 180 lb husband has stepped on a few and they survived without a crack. Last Year Santa brought a large ZOOB set and during the year my son remarked on how he wished there were wheels so he could design vehicles. Then we found this set- perfect! It does not disappoint:) 
This is a great toy. Very durable. This Batmobile was built to last! My Son looooooves it 
I recently gave this car as a birthday gift to a four year old boy in my home daycare. He loves it so much! It is very detailed and yet still very rugged. He has had two problems with it but an older child would have more patience. It's difficult getting his Batman to sit all the way down in the seat. And unless he's all the way down, the top won't close and has popped off (it looks difficult to pop off, but this kid has done it). It's easy for an adult to pop back on. The second issue has been getting the arrows that shoot out back into the guns. You have to rotate them until they pop in. These are pretty minor problems if you have a child with a little patience and the overall quality far outweighs these issues 
I saw this toy at my [...] and decided to suprise my 34 year old. This was the best money I have ever spent and would have gladly paid 10x that amount. My sons have found many of their other action figures that fit into the cockpit and even have ones whose hands fit on the steering wheel. I am looking for a Batman figure but they are happy while I searching. The sounds, push button action and missle lauching is perfect for little fingers. There are so many additional features on this toy that they have made this their favorite toy. Buzz and Spiderman have now subcum to BATMAN!!!! 
i bought this version of the Batmobile instead of the RC version because it was not as pricey and didn't require a separately-purchased, expensive battery. this version is a great Batmobile. the electronic lights and sounds are cool, the rockets hide great inside the chassis, everything looks great. it's great to roll across the floor and startle any sleeping pets. the only problem? the Battle Gear Batman figure i have DOES NOT fit in the cockpit. the cockpit is way too small, requiring you to bend and jam your Batman action figure's limbs and trying unsuccessfully to force it into the cockpit seat, and even then it doesn't fit. i like to take care of my things, since i see them more as collector's items rather than toys. i wanted this Batmobile to be a safe place for my Batman figure, which normally lies out in the open. so unfortunately, this is a big disappointment. oh well, the rest of the Batmobile looks great 
My 5 year old was hooked on this toy when it first came out. Now that the movie has just released on DVD and it contains a lot of batmobile footage....he is hooked all over again! My kid is REALLY hard on his toys and most are missing heads, arms, legs, broken or dismantled within a day. This toy is still working 100% and still in one piece! This is not a junk toy and well worth the money spent 
All of the kids love this batmobile. Unfortunately we lost the darts the first day. : 
My 13 year old son bought this toy with a gift certificate he got for his birthday. And he absolutely loves it! He says, "I like the toy very much! I really, really like it! It launches rockets and it makes lots of cool noise." He plays with it a lot, and it's also good for scaring the cats. lol 
The product is impressive but it more delightful if a miniature of batman is included. I thought a miniature of batman is included in this product. Well anyway, the product is impressive 
If you're unsure of what to buy for a birthday present, this is it. I bought it for my 7 year old and every boy from age 4 and up love it. When we have play groups, all the kids want it 
I bought this car for my son to play with his rectangular street rug. These are really cute cars, make of some kind of soft rubber that make them safe for a 10 months old. The wheels are strong enough to be able to roll even on the rug or on the carpets. The house soft fabric box is great when you want a toy to go. A cute toy for a cute price. 
I love this line and I hope it does well. This Ace is awesome. I love that he comes with his flyer and especially with Bud and Lou! I only wish that Bud and Lou were jointed and possible as opposed to being PVCs (very weighty pvcs I might add). Buy these toys and maybe Fisher Price will make more Krypto figures 
We were looking for a new toy for our then six month-old daughter, when a kind stranger recommended the Triangle as one her child had found entertaining. We looked closer at it and realized just how much was going on in this toy - each side has multiple different actions, shapes, colors and activities, and there are spinners, rattles and mirrors too. In essence, you gain five sides of activity, and can extend the entertainment value of the toy by periodically rotating it for younger kids so that it always presents something new. As they become stronger, they begin to discover that it can be picked up and shook for added interaction, and will also begin rotating to different sides themselves. While it is just slightly on the large size for easy portability, when we did have room, we were sure to pack it for trips as this one toy provides far more entertainment than carrying multiple others. Plus, it is well made and very durable. Now at 16 months, our daughter still carries this around as one of her favorite toys. We love it and she does too! We'll certainly be hanging on to this one for the next baby! A tremendous value 
We recieved this as a part of a gift box my mom bought at costco's. I didn't think much of it when I saw it but it was bright and colorful.  Also in the package was a blue hippo that had blocks inside it and a plunger to push them out. Frankly speaking my 6 month old (at the time, now 7months) didn't know what to do with it, and it didn't capture his attention. However wow! This gadget Triangle! My Goodness!! There is so much to look at and do, he is captivated by it. :) He'll play with one side of the triangle for so long that he forget it has activities on the other sides. So every 10 minutes or so, I'll flip it and he will gurgle with renewed enthusiasm and start playing with the 'new' side! When my son gets sleepy and lies back on his nursing pillow, often I'll hold it up and turn it back and forth so he can watch the 2 gears race up and down. One of them moves in a zig zag pattern and the other spins, its even fun for me to watch. As a side note, its great exercise for your wrist. It also makes a pleasant sound, when the tiny balls rattle, sounds like your shaking a box of salt, not too loud, perfect for a drowsy baby. I also like that: 1. It has so many toys on it but is just one piece, so no lost parts or cleanup. 2. No batteries needed. 3. Its not a loud toy, just loud enough. I highly highly recommend this toy, its really a bargain! One update: At 9 months, my child is still crazy about The Triangle. I believe the whole Infantino gift box with both toys was $[...]. And no batteries needed. :) What a bargain! 
Very little usage and very light usage of this product resulted in a broken rim 
My son who absolutely loves all sports cannot get enough of the Hoop Challenge! With two balls, a pump and an over the door hoop complete with separate LED scoring and even crowd noises what is not to love? He can play by himself and practice his free throws and "three pointers" or he can challenge his dad or me or even his sister to a game of one on one. The coolest thing is that this hoop actually recognizes which ball goes in and scores accordingly! The balls are color coded: white and black. The only reason that I gave this only 4 stars is that it doesn't always score correctly and it will score if anything breaks the sensor on the rim, like your hand. The scores only go up by one point instead of two. Also, the crowd noises get to be a bit much; what would really improve this is if you could have a dual switch where you can have the crowd noises on or off, but you have to listen to them if you want to use the scoring system. But this is one of the coolest and most often used toys in our house and will be loved for many many years to come 
The basketball hoop was great until the hoop wouldnot stay on the back board. This problem started about 1 week after I received this gift for Christmas. I've been unable to use it since then 
A gift for my sister's 6th birthday. I was over-joyed because I had one when I was her age. I ended up decorating the crown, although I'm sure she could have handled it, I just think she wouldn't have thought to make a pattern to make it look nice. Setting the game board up is a little hard. You have to remember how the colors go otherwise it won't fit just right. It's like a puzzle almost. The jewlery is just like the classic game, simple and easy to take on and off. Yes it's cheap and that's a good thing seeing as how both my sister and I have forgotten to take off one piece well after we played the game. The jewlery even fit me at 22 so even us big kids can play! There isn't much difference with this one and the original except you have a Cinderella themed board edges and clock tower. If the original is cheaper then get that one. It won't make a difference to the girl because the game is still the same. The only downside was when we played with just two players it was hard to get rid of the clock tower (which you need to, to win). We would just end up going around and around the board either trying to get rid of the tower or trying to get the "take any piece" circle to get the crown. We ended up making it so that if you landed on the clocktower after you already have it you can put it back on the game board. I think with three or more players we could just keep circling but with just us we use that cheat. Another thing for us was when I tried to open one of the earrings it fell apart and this was the first time we played it. It didn't break, I just had to pop it back into it's tiny holes but it still sucked since it was a new game. 
The Pretty Pretty Princess Cinderella Edition game is one of our five year old daughter's favorite games. We had fun gluing on the stickers and trying to match our jewelry set. Having to wear the jewelry adds to the fun. It's an easy game to learn and play. Her grandmother enjoyed playing this game and even glued sparkling craft pieces on the bottom of the jewelry box, much to the delight of our little Princess. As previous reviewer mentioned the game is not 'educational'. While I, too, like educational games, I don't think that every game has to be educational. Sharing time to play together is rewarding in itself. The Pretty Pretty Princess Game is simply a sweet little girl's game, one all three generations had fun playing. 
My daughters love this game! It's fun and they pretend with it, so there are extra laughs! It's too easy for kids over the age of 6 or 7, and I would say that it's a great beginner's game for ages 3. My 4 year old decorated her crown and has a BLAST playing this game! The play jewelry is easy to put on, and fun! A 
My daughter loves this game. It is not educational, but is usually better than watching TV. Advantages - The box takes up little space. I actually like how the board is 4 puzzle pieces for this reason, and do not find it flimsy. - The jewelry seems as durable as other play jewelry to me, but I have not bought Disney jewelry before. - The spinner/ jewelry box does seem very durable, and is such a great idea. - My daughter loves just playing with the jewelry for dressup. Disadvantages - Not very educational (little strategy is involved). - Many fathers would not be willing to play this game. - The game pieces are so much fun apart from the game, that they may become los 
My 5 year old got this as a present and liked it. However, her 3 year old little sister plays it and enjoys it more. It does seem a little too simple for older ones but it is entertaining. Also, it can tend to get a little boring as you continue to play since it seems to take some time to finally win. Actually we have never played it till someone wins because they seem to grow tired of it before that happens. All in all, this is a good board game and it is fun to play...just maybe not till the end 
We only have the alphabet puzzle, but my almost 2 year old loves it. She has a lot of patience, and will do th epuzzle 6 or 7 times in one sitting. There are a lot of little pieces that try to get lost, but I think this is a great intro to letters. She has started to say 2 or 3 of the letters because we talk about them as she puts them into the puzzle. I didn't realize that this would be her favorite of all the puzzles we have 
My daughter received this gift for christmas along with a play kitchen. She just loves putting on her apron and oven mitt and baking things. She even uses the towel like daddy does- like another oven mitt. 
This wood version of the game is wonderfully durable. It looks attractive when playing and when on the shelf. It has a classic aged look 
If you are trying to collect all the cars from Cars the Movie, this one is a must-have! It matches The Hudson Hornet EXACTLY from the end of the movie (when Disney gets your tears flowing)! Get it if you are collecting! I would give the toy 5 stars except it is an obvious marketing ploy to get consumers to, well - buy, buy, buy... and if they are going to do that, I would rather see a replica car of "Tex" instead of a second Hudson Hornet 
The car case is really cute and a great idea, but not well made. The latch broke off within days of receiving it. If you don't have the exact cars that are pictured, then they may not fit. The car spots are specially fit for the cars pictured. Save your money on this one 
We love this case because it fits all the cars, even the big ones. We are actually looking to buy another one because so many more cars have come out they don't all fit in one case 
My son loves this case. Its made out of thick sturdy plastic and is nice and rugged. It doubles as a race track, but its kind of small for that. 
Even though this puzzle is intended for children, it has another use. My blind mother wished she could remember the placement of all of the states. She said "If only they made a puzzle-like product that had all of the states which would talk when you pressed each state." I searched and searched through all the catalogs of products made for visually impared people and found nothing. Then a friend showed me the Melissa Doug USA Map Sound Puzzle she had bought for a child. Wow! This was exactly what I was looking for. My mom found the puzzle easy to use and has spent hours with it. The voice is loud and clear. So far, she has been able to remove each piece, listen to the information, and replace it without getting "lost". The only negatives for this kind of use is that the intended use is to take all the pieces out, then put them back one-by-one. For a blind person, you have to take each piece out separately and put it back before taking the next piece out. Getting an inland state out can be a bit difficult. Also, some of the smaller states are grouped into one piece, so a blind person only can tell that the states are grouped, but can't tell how they relate geographically to each other. For its intended use as a child's puzzle, it would work fine. Just make sure your child is over the age where he or she would try to swallow a piece. They are small and can be a choking hazard 
Wow! In the series, this is the piece to rival Red Riding Hood. The 'twisted' Gretel brings her into the graphic novel-esque dimensions of a girl. The image of Gretel is sexy and looks great from the tattoos to the fishnets high heels. This far outshines the accompanying Hansel(but sold separately) figure. I'll admit, it's a bit of a sexist view on the female figures sculpting but it's still great art. While Red may be the best figure of the series, Gretel may be my favorite 
Tamagotchi connections are very cool.They are usually sold out at lots of places because right now they are so popular.They're really fun to play with because you can play games and enter codes online, buy stuff, and feed them like a real parent would do. They're not the best to bring to school though because they distract you in class. It's usually best to leave them at home and put them on pause. Most people think they're pretty dumb so if you like playing with electronic toys, then you should maybe consider buying one of these.If you decide to buy one of these you might want to buy an extra set of batteries in case yours runs out. They're platinum batteries a tamagotchi can hold two 
it is fun! and the colour is awesome. so many new things to do, i can never be bored again 
hey i just got this one yesterday and i cant stop playing the games on it i already have 7000 points!!!!!! 
my friend has three tamagotchis and they are so fun to play wit! the minis make no sense but still the v3 is so awesome 
I looked every where for this! Then i found it at toysrus online but they dont have it they ran out. Man i wish i could have one 
Tamagotchis are cool, cute, fun, nice, ultra hot and amazing! I have like 11 of them! They're the best toy in history! Everyone is tama-crazy! You should get one 
My 3 year old grandson is wild about cooking shows especially Emeril. So is his mom. He would set up on a large ottoman with his mother's pots and pans. Now he has his own utensils and loves them. His favorite is his own timer which only times one minute 
As the title says, but one corner of the product was broken during shipping or ??? We did not want to wast time and postage returning it, so we patched it up the best we could with tape. Otherwise, a great toy and lots of fun - my son is in 3rd grade and every kid now wants one for themselves 
What the heck is the Amozon featured reviewer talking about. IT'S AN ANT FARM! We better keep an eye on her students. Anyway, it is a drag that there is no queen. My grandson was pretty disappointed. It is probably better to not order the ants at all, left up a rock in sandy loam and grap as many workers and eggs that you can. Chances are that you will not get a queen but if you get young enough eggs the workers will grow a new one 
I had this ant farm as a child and LOVED it. It was very educational and entertaining. The ants created their own little community, along with connecting "highways" (tunnels), a graveyard (they carried the dead ants to one little area of the farm and buried them), and even a food "cellar" (they stored all their extra food in one little area at the bottom of the farm). My ants lived for several months and only died when my mother was cleaning house and tried to move it. The tunnels all collapsed and the ants were killed. I am currently a 4th grade teacher and purchasing this for my classroom. I am going to use it to teach habitats and communitites, but most importantly lifeskills. Ants exemplify so many lifeskills...patience, cooperation, perseverance, endurance, caring, effort, problem solving, etc. WOW!! So much we can learn from one tiny creature. 
Took like 2 months to get the ants. Two weeks for them to die. We have 2 ants alive. After two weeks. I don't know.... We followed the instructions.. 
Really neat to see ants run through tunnels, have meetings, and dig. They can really work hard! Very durable, but carefull not to scratch it. All in all, a fun pet 
The Ant Farm is a wonderful educational toy, but the quality is disappointing as other reviewers have said. The plastic has rough, unattractive edges from manufacture, and the bottom is not perfectly flat, so it can wobble a little bit. None of this will matter to my nephews, but certainly the manufacturer should do a better job 
We love the Radio Flyer classic wagon. We use it more than I thought we would. Our boys love going for rides in it. 
this toy is the greatest toy i have ever played with. every time i played with it was a new adventure 
We were very disappointed with this toy that we bought as a gift for a friend's baby. The daughter absolutely loves it, but the suction does not work at all. It is really too bad, because it would be perfect for a high chair toy 
I had high hopes for this toy to entertain my 9 month old in his highchair or on the stroller. While it is a cute and fun toy for him to play with, the suction doesn't work well. My son was able to remove it immediately with normal play. I have to actually hold it up for him to play with it. It is a bummer because he really likes it.....when it is standing up. 
My son is 5 and this was a great gift for him. He enjoys the many different activities associated with each DVD. Unlike a previous person complained, I was fully aware you needed the special player to view this DVD. The player is very easy to use and my son requires very little assistance from me. He sits for over an hour playing with each DVD!! 
My 4 y/o daughter and 2 y/o son both love this toy. They enjoy having their very own "CD player". There are 3 discs that they can play and there is also a convenient storage space on the back of the player to hold the two that are not being played. I think this is very smart because other similar toys do not have this space and we ended up losing some of the extra CDs. The microphone is wonderful for them to sing along with. There is also a three setting volume control... great for the parents! The only "negative" comment would be that the songs on the CDs are on the short side, with a few barely 10 seconds long. All in all, a fun durable toy that has remained a favorite with my kids for several months now.  
My three year old loves to hear the sound of her own voice and to sing along with the songs. A fun toy. It's a little hard for her to put the fake CD's in the fake player because you have to line then up perfectly in order to be able to close the cover 
I was worried that my 15 month-old will be to young to start playing with Legos, but she proved me wrong. She loves them and can play even alone. These are little bit smaller than the first set we got, but still bigger than their regular size for older kids. I would recommend this toy to everyone with small children: it improves their motorical skills and coordination 
We've purchased this as a complement for the Bulk Tub, and both sets completely fit in the tub, so we use the bucket to store other toys in the bathroom. These are large duplo pieces, the smallest about an inch square, great for babies starting 6-9 months old. The comments I made for the bulk tub apply, and I highly recommend these for the versatily and creativity. You can make anything out of them, you're only limited by the number (both sets are enough for quite a lot) and by your imagination (I've made, trucks, boats, castles, even a cathedral). It provided great long hours of fun with my daughter now 3 years old. I expect it'll do so until she's at least 6, at which point we may switch to other smaller but more challenging toys (like the reggular legos) 
My daughter is 18 months old and she loves to play with blocks. She developed interest in bigger blocks that came with the activity table. She liked to create a tower with it. To elaborate more of her hand-eye co-ordination skills, I bought this 90 piece bucket for her. It is a perfect first blocks set for a toddler. The blocks are not too big like Mega blocks and not much small like Duplo blocks. This size is perfect for their tiny hands to work with. Plus I find the bucket has nice quantity of blocks, not too many to get tired of the mess and not too little so that the young ones get to explore enough 
This is a large bucket has 90 pieces in it. There are lots of the standard shapes, including 57 squares, 13 rectangles, and 2 thin rectangles. There are also some fun and unusual shaped blocks including 4 squares with eyes on them, 2 squares with slanted edges, 6 rectangles with rounded edges, 1 half round, 2 rectangles with a quarter round cut-out, 1 rectangle with two quarter round cut-outs, 1 windmill blade, and a rounded top piece that the windmill blade attaches to 
He absolutely loves these toys, specifically the little people...which he has a tendency to lose and unfortunately Amazon does not seem to carry the people as separate sales items, although they are offered on Wow!'s website in Britain...losing these little guys has been a bit tramatic...please start selling the little people Mr. Bezos 
My son received this as a gift for his 2nd birthday and fell in love at first sight. He only had eyes for this fire truck for the rest of his party. Two days later, it is still his favorite toy. I like that it does not require batteries, but still makes some noises. I really think this toy has staying power because there are some features of the toy that my son has not figured out yet. I think he'll have fun with it for a long time 
I work with children from infants to 5 years old. It is a excellent toy for toddlers.It helps their eye and hand coordination and they love watching the balls go down and come out. It keeps their attention for long periods of time. It helps older children learn colors and cause and effect. The children I worked with ejoyed it so much I am now buying it for my granddaughter 
None of the toppings have a chance of staying on the pizza except the one that is placed directly in the middle. The pizza is way to tipsy for any fun at all and the toppings are made of hard plastic. Trying to think of a way to modify to use it...should just send it back. 
Our 5 year old daughter got this as a holiday gift. It's turned out to be a favorite game for the entire family and friends. It's a clever, fun, fast and creative game for the whole family. Even our 2 year old son loves it - however it changes the whole out come of the game. He stands back and just throws toppings at the wobbling pie but he's entertained for 15 or 20 minutes so that's worth a lot! We'd recommend this as a birthday gift to kids because it's unique and fun 
This is one of our 3 years olds favorite games. She especially likes playing with her daddy. She even plays with the toppings in her play kitchen. 
I bought this thinking it would be fun for my 4-year-old, but he quickly became discouraged. The pieces slide off so easily that he was almost immediately disqualified, according to game rules. His dad and I found it difficult as well. You have to pile all the game pieces in the middle very carefully to get anywhere with this one. Where was the quality control when they invented this? 
The box says that this game is for 4-7 year olds. When my 4 yr old son got this last year we discovered that the box couldn't even read 30 years and up. Both my hubby and my brother tried to play this game unsuccessfully. The problem is that the pizza surface is too slick and the pieces will not stay balanced up there. The toppings though are really well made and Isaac had fun making pretend pizza with them but we were never able to play the game. it was a disappointment b/c it looked so cute. We bought Topple instead this year, which is the same concept 
These are great. My grandson will be 3y/o and loves to paint.The paint cups do help to prevent spillage. It can be filled cleaned easily. I would definitely recommend the paint cups,if you are buying the Melissa Doug Easel b/c they fit easily into the tray where paint is kept 
We purchased this table for our 3 yr old son for Christmas and he was VERY excited to see it set up "under" the tree. He plays with it quite a bit, loves the track and all the pieces that came with it. Everything is made of wood and seems to be good quality. The table top has a nice road and building scene painted on it with bright colors, it's very cheerful. The track pieces fit with other wooden track pieces from other sets pretty well. The only thing I would change is for the table to be a little taller. It's at a pretty good height so that he can walk around the table moving the trains on the track and such, but a little higher table might last him a little longer. The table was also very easy to assemble. My husband did it Christmas Eve in less than an hour, with no swearing or throwing of parts!! We think the table is great. 
kids play with it every day! well worth the money and makes the $$$ spent on trains even more worth while 
WOW!!!!!Love it. Our kids love it. They play for days with it. Great craftsmanship. Lots of parts but worth the time to put together 
If you've mastered the 3x3 cube and are looking for a challenge, go for the 4x4. As we all know, competitive cubing is almost exclusively on the 3x3...however, if you want to bone up on your cubing skills this is a great training cube. There are so many more combinations and permutations of cube coloring in the 4x4 design...think about it, there are 96 sub-cubes in this version vs. 54 in the original 3x3 cube. Like many of the other Rubik's products, this cube is not flawless. Stickers peel easy and there's a bit of squeak in the twist action. I wouldn't use in a competition, but like I said 4x4s are rarely used for competition. Buy as a training aid 
Good sequil to the original cube. I've invented my own method to solving it by using 3x3 techniques. Only two minor problems with the cube. If you are spinning it really fast, sometimes a cube will pop out, and for some reason the orange colored stickers fray faster than the other colors. But other than that a really good buy 
I used to love playing with the 3x3 Rubik's cube as a kid and decided to get it for my son for Christmas. I mistakenly ordered the 4x4, but decided it didn't matter - still the same kind of fun and challenge. The day it was opened, the stickers started to come off and when I tried to use it, within the first 30 seconds, four pieces came off, one of which broke and can't be fixed! I just went online to order the 3x3, but are finding similar reviews about stickers, etc. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! 
I love rubik's cube I myself can solve a regular rubik's cube but not the big one the problem though is the stickers they peel off about the second day that you use it they need to go back to the way they did it in the eighty's paint that way I don'y have to buy a new one every time a sticker falls of 
I bought the cube, and it was in ruins a week later due to the fact that the cube started showing signs of flakiness by the second day: some of the stickers (mostly the white and blue ones) had begun peeling off. This is beyond belief because this toy should have been designed / built with the durability to withstand some handling; the statement "if you learn how to solve the cube, then you'll be performing thousands of turns on it" is spot-on. 
On Stephen F. Yegge Steevey's review replace the word cube with duck. It is really funny XD 
I bought the cube, and it was in ruins a week later. One of the center pieces broke off, and it's irreparable. I saw it coming, though, because the cube started showing signs of flakiness by the second day: some of the stickers (mostly the orange ones) had begun peeling off, and the pieces were getting very loose, very fast. The cube burst side pieces out on two occasions before its final destruction. I was being as gentle as possible, but if you learn how to solve the cube, then you'll be performing thousands of turns on it. Both the 3x3 and the 5x5 cubes seem to hold up a lot better than the 4x4. I'm hoping I can find another manufacturer. I've played with 3x3 cubes from many manufacturers over the years, and some are obviously better-made and more durable than others. This isn't one of the good ones. If you're going to make serious attempts at solving your 4x4, I recommend lubricating it with something. The cube-solving sites seem to recommend silicone spray (whatever that is). When I was in high school I'd take them apart and put vaseline in them, which smooths over the "catches" that happen as you turn rows that are slightly misaligned, and also has a slightly glue-y effect that holds it together better 
This is a super well-constructed toy, simple and straightforward. My son really likes it. Before he was ready to put the shapes in their individual holes, he would just dump them out and put them back in the top. His hand fits fine into the top hole. It's a little weighty, but that's not a bad thing, especially since recent studies have shown that kids who play with weighted toys have better muscle tone. I'm knocking off a star because, as a previous reviewer mentioned, the vertical slots are trickier to use than the slanted ones 
The beads are fun, and nice colors are available, with good selection and quantity. They are a bit small, so hard to use for some one like myself with little hand/eye coordination. The product came with a good variety of strings and I was able to create quite a few diferent items. 
I bought this and was dissapointed.It was not good at turning at all eventually I got angry and threw it straight up and watched it fall and crash into nothing.That was the most fun I've had with that plane.If you're looking for an easy plane to fly buy the Tyco RC sky scorcher it is way better 
This was the simplest, ready to go airborne-ready product I have ever experienced. My 9-year old got the hang of it quite easily and it survives "crash landings" with minimum damage overall. It also survived crashing into a lake (which I don't recommend doing this without a remote-controlled motorcraft to retreive the plane) and dried out to fly again! Fantastic toy 
A guy I work with is really in to R/C planes and his enthusiasm has finally spilled over to me. I recently bought this Dominator just because I wanted "wing" with dual motors...so I went to Wally World and plunked down about $30.00 for this thing. At first, the plane did a sharp right turn and cartwheeled on the blacktop of our parking lot! Surprisingly , there were only a few scuffs...my buddy bent the rudders a little and we tried it again and it flew pretty straight and he got it up at least 200' in the air and it was pretty awesome! I then flew it a few times with no crashes, but it IS kind of hard to control....you do need a lot of space to have fun with this thing. Something to remember: ABSOLUTELY double charge the batteries EVERY TIME! My flight times are around 5-7 minutes each time. I've learned to get it WAY up in the air as soon as possible and then only a few touches left or right .... it glides pretty nice for a cheap little plane. It does look cool in the air and I like the sound of the motors when turning... I'd recommend it , but only fly it with someone experienced with them at first.....Overall, I'd buy it again!...Oh, use clear packing tape along the leading edges of the wings! Trust me, it makes a difference... 
This plane was useless. It crashed on it's first flight, and broke. We never could get it to fly right, and it quickly was smashed to pieces. Don't waste money on this plane 
My 9 year old son got this for his birthday and he (Ok, we) love it. We crashed it many times (always on grass) learning to fly it and it has taken no damage at all. Being foam, I would not fly it over any hard surfaces or around trees and houses. We fly it at the local park or the school field where we have plenty of room. Once we got used to the controls, we can now fly it for the full 2-3 minute charge non-stop. I'm now looking at other Air Hogs planes for me so we can fly together 
These Creature Peepers are wonderful!! Our 4-year-old just loves his! Before we had this, he was always bringing his newly-found "friends" into the house. Yuck!! Since buying the Creature Peeper, he still brings his 6 and 8-legged "friends" into the house- but now I am much calmer about it! He loves to catch all sorts of bugs and study them through the magnifying scopes in the top and bottom of this toy. Great fun for curious children! 
We bought this hot tub a few months ago and we really love it. It was so easy to fill and just plug and play. The waterfull is especially pretty at night. (this is one of the only tubs in its price range with colorchanging water fall and seats built in that we had seen). Being our first hottub we did alot of research and decided we did not want to have to rewire our electric in case we want to move it around. It is made great for the price and the shell is very sturdy.It did take quite a while to heat up (we live near Chicago so it is cold here). But once heated it retains heat well. If considering a tub in this price range I would definately consider this tub. We use it every day, even in the freezing weather right out back on a concrete pad. Only thing we kind of wish we would have bought the X-500 model which seats five and has a lounger seat in it, but I am sure we will be getting our moneys worth from this 
I have owned my X-spa for over a year now. It is wonderful! Just fill it up, plug it in and enjoy. Does not impact my electric bill at all. Maintenance free (well, you do still have to clean it, you know). Works on regular household current, no need to rewire. Customer service with this company is top notch - great people to deal with 
This is a piece of junk. My husband and I went to set it up to surprise our son and had it back in the box before he ever saw it. It is not worth the money 
My 5 year old sleeps in this on the weekends. It is very durable. We've had it for a long time. To the ones who said it won't go up or collapses easily...YOU DIDN'T ASSEMBLE IT CORRECTLY. It folds up nicely under the bed and it expands so well that it's a bit difficult to move through the hallway. Luckily it's bendable. I don't know about playing in it though. It is kind of small unless it's for a 2 year old or younger. Our son only sleeps in it 
I am being generous giving this thing a star, it's more like -10 stars!! By far, the absolute worst toy I've ever bought!! I paid $19.99 for this piece of garbage. Within 5 hours of setting it up it collapsed permanently. No bottom to support it. It has these silly plastic tubes that you put over both door ways (supposedly to support it) and those were broken in less than 24 hours. The wire that holds up the tent is very flimsy and bends easily so almost instantly my kids bent it out of shape and once that is done the thing won't stand up. Four years ago we bought a plastic Hello Kitty tent at a yard sale for a dollar and a friend gave us the plastic house shaped frame for it and that thing lasted years, I was expecting too much from this one I suppose. Makes me mad since I paid retail for the dumb thing. DON'T BUY THIS TOY UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO THROW AWAY!!! YOURS WILL SOON TURN TO GARBAGE LIKE MINE DID!!! ABSOLUTE TRASH!! Before purchasing this for my son for Christmas he was really into making forts, so I set up a card table and gave him 2 old sheets and some pillows and blankets for the inside and he was a happy camper, thought this would add to his enjoyment since it was Spider-Man!!! I will be throwing Spiderman OUT and setting up the card table again!! AND I REPEAT....DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS ON THIS ONE!! 
Great size and everything, it's just that this tent will collapse if you touch the edges. And knowing kids, it collapses a lot 
THE TENT IS TOO FLIMSY. IT CAN'T SUPPORT ITSELF, IT'S AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER IT GETS PUSHED ALL AOVER THE PLACE BY MY KIDS. THEY DON'T EVEN PLAY IN IT ANYMORE 'CAUSE THEY ARE OVER IT 
This toy has been great so far. I purchased it for my 7 year old who just had to have it for Christmas. I found the battery pack right on a rack at Best Buy for $20. The 2 boys have laughed and played for hours with it. My 7 year old took his Christmas money and purchased an NSECT also by TYCO (all battereies included) and he loves that too. Only problem now is that the radio frequencies conflict so they cant play with them at the same time. I should have checked that. I would recommend either of these toys for boys their age. I love to watch them light up 
My son loved this toy at christmas, however in less than an hour it was broken. The gears had stripped on one side, and it never made it out of the house. Now, amazon.com was very good in saying they would send another...I sent the broken back...but the toy was on back order until April, 06. I waited, at the request of my 8 year old son who wanted it so badly...the time came and went...the only way I knew what was going on was by my contacting them...they never bothered to let me know of any problems with the order...but always apologetic. I finally asked for a refund in April because they told me it was still not available....now I'm stuck with the battery pack that doesn't go with anything else....and after reading all the other reviews, I wouldn't chance getting another one, even though my son did love it. 
Before I talk about the toy, everyone please note YOU MUST ALSO PURCHASE THE TYCO PRO FLEXPACK BATTERY PACK. I'm sure it's just an oversight on the part of Amazon Toys R Us. However, the ad for the Shell Shocker only states that the toy requires 2 AA batteries. So wrong. The ad also shows that people who have purchased the Shell Shocker have also purchased the TMH Flexpak Battery Pack and Charger. I followed, but was mislead. To top it all off, because we opened the package, we were to be charged for shipping to return it. Wait! There's more. When you search Amazon for the correct battery pack, you are redirected to BananaToys.com (...)Toys R Us worked it out for us though. Our local Toys R Us store had the battery pack in-stock (...), allowed us to return the incorrect product to the store, and they credited the cost of the wrong battery shipping charges. Thank you Toys R Us. As for the toy. It's amazing. We bought the Shell Shocker for our grandson's seventh birthday. He absolutely loves it! I'm sure who has more fun with it--him, his dad, or his grandfather. Watch the tail--it can inflict pain. But if you're aware and careful, it's just a blast to play with and watch 
First let me say this...ANYONE who does not know to purchase or at least check to make sure that batteries come with ANY toy these days is an idiot. Second...If you had half a brain, you'd charge the thing BEFORE you wrapped it up. That way it's ready to go. Yes...$100 is alot of cash..but we all end up paying it to see the look on the kids' faces. However, all of that that was just stated is a mute point when addressing this toy. It is absolute junk..And if you have gotten more than an hour of play out of it, you are one of the few lucky ones. It takes very little pressure on the "fins" to overpower the gears while morphing. At that point, the gears break and you have a $100 paper weight. Now...you can send it back..Amazon absolutely took care of that for us...But what you are going to get in return is the same piece of junk...Only new and shiny, that will be broken in an hour again. We purchased two..one for each of the boys. The gears broke on one the first hour. And that was while using it inside. Amazon replaced it very quickly. I think it lasted a couple hours. The second Shocker has the same electrical problem as others are stating. Doesn't want to power up. We even went to the trouble of finding another battery...At a local Wal-Mart of all places. Still does not work. Save your money on this one..It looks like a couple of people have lucked out with theirs..But read ALL the reviews. The majority of people are having the same problems. Unfortunately, we purchased ours early on...and there were no reviews to read at all. 
I can say now that I have recieved the battery pack that I ordered, It is a blast! My kids and husband love it! THIS THING IS A MONSTER!!!!! It is fun to watch the laughter while it is digging through mud. 
Loads of fun!!! 
This was the must have toy for my 7 year old. Found one at Toy-R-Us (...); also bought the 1 year replacement plan. Found out about the battery and bought one at the same time. Christmas came a week late and when the present was opened it was discovered Toy-R-Us sold me the wrong battery (should have checked it myself). And if you have already tried to buy this gismo you know the battery is not to be found except on line. Ordered one from Amazon and it was delivered several days later. Charged it up and popped it in; chased my dog around the living room for about 10 minutes and then waited for the next day for my 7 year old to take it outside. I have a back yard about 1/2 the size of a football field, all grass and soft earth from last nights rain. He broke it in 20 minutes. I retuned the unit to Toys-R-Us and they gave me a full refund, even the cost of the replacement plan (by now my 7 year old wanted something else). Okay, but I still have a (...)battery (if you count shipping) and Amazon won't take anything back that's been opened. I went back to Toys-R-Us and they were nice enough to refund me the price of the battery also; they are a class act. I rated the educational value as 5; that was for me not my son :-) 
It's just like the real thing and taste like it too! I put this in my mom's purse and she totally freaked out she was like "oh my god is this real!" and she beat the dog with a wooden spoon. Definately worth the $14 
I don't know what to say, other than that this confirms what a loser I am. 
Both me and my kids have learned so much from this toy. We rarely start our children out on real items until they understand the fake ones first. Therefore, we have been slowly going over each inch of this toy and explaining the bits and pieces to our children. What fun! We even made a model of peach pillows to push the toy in and out of. It really taught them a lot. Eventually, we moved on to the art of touching and playing with it. It was really neat when we gave little Robert his first real piece to explore. He was so experienced! I believe it was because he had so much practice with the toy first! Thank you, 'Doggie Done It!' You really helped us learn to play with our poop as a family and now we truly are closer than ever before. If only Jimmy hadn't succumbed to that awful problem with dissentary, he could be here with little Robert and Josiah. Jimmy never was as talented as the other 2 with the quick regurgitation, which is necessary to avoid the ingestion of too much fecal matter, obviously. So buy this toy 
The consistency is all off. When you throw it, it doesn't stick to anything. It's odorless and it tastes like plastic!! Why pay shipping and handling for something I can get for free! 
Mckenzie, A.K.A, NO MORE FAKE REVEIWS! Is right,my dad works for Amazon too and is constantly having to talk to people on the phone about making any more reveiws. I finally stopped, i was the one who posted: SO YOU WANT TO BE A BANANA! But from doing that i got grounded for a year with NO Christmas presents 
With twin 4 year old girls, I have vast experience with little houses, castles, etc... This toy far exceeds most of them out there, including many disney products and barbie castles. The pieces are small, yet manageable and sturdy. There are enough "tricks" (working light, mailbox, etc..) to keep it interesting, yet not so many that it is too much for a preschooler. The miniature little ponies are adorable and fun to play with. I was impressed with the product considering the affordable price ($22 and it came with an extra free pony). I have paid $20 already for a barbie castle that only comes with tiny thin miniature plastic pieces (that always get lost) and thin, cheap plastic structures that do nothing (no lights, etc..) This product is well worth it 
As the mother of a little girl I have alot of experience when it comes to plastic playsets, sadly most of them have little attention to detail and are poorly made, my daugther started eyeing this when it first came out in the stores and asking for it. She just received it for her birthday and I think I was almost as impressed with it as she is in love with it. The attention to detail is amazing on a $20 plastic toy, working lights (batteries included!), mail box that opens (and is full of letters actually addressed to different ponies), working drawer w/ bottles inside that snap onto the top, little shower brush, etc. She's been playing with it and the smaller ponyville sets I got her nonstop for days, excellent value 
I'm a 21 year old My Little Pony collector and recently a friend at work brought my attention to the "Ponyville" mini ponies, which I was initially skeptical about. But oh my gosh! I think I like them more than regular ponies! Sorry, girls!! The ponies are small, but sturdy and you don't have to worry about their hair getting tangled because they are all moulded plastic, but with fabulous attention to detail! Pinkie Pie's balloon house is such a wonderful playset, and if you're going to buy one playset, buy this one. It's more fun than the Sweet Shop, in my opinion. The froggy is adorable, and removeable from his fountain. The house itself snaps shut so your little one can carry it with her. The tiny pieces either have pegs to hold them in place or can be put in the tiny drawer in the bedroom. I LOVE how precious the bathroom is, even though we're left to wonder; Where do My Little Ponies answer the calls of nature? There are also "add ons" you can buy, such as Triple Treat's ice cream thingie and Sunny's swing. They are each around $5! In conclusion, this playset is sturdy, well made, clever and doesn't take up nearly as much room as a regular MLP playset, and you can infinitely add on things, making it more fun (I embellished mine with the new McCdonalds toys and other Ponyville accessory sets). Make sure you get one for your little girl 
My daughter absolutely loves this playset. It's fairly small compared the 'normal' sized playset and comes with different mini-ponies (depending on where you buy it). The mini-ponies are about the size of the littlest pet shop figures, without the bobbling heads. The accessories however are TINY, and I wouldn't recommend this set around any child younger than 4. The mini-ponies themselves are fairly sturdy and solid. There's a lot of attention to detail to the playset. The are also lots of cute accessory sets that can be purchased for under $10. I like the fact you can buy packs of the mini-ponies for around the same price as a regular sized pony. This is a great way to have a good sized pony collection for your child, without having to give up lots of room. All in all, I think this Ponyville theme line of mini-ponies from Hasbro is a keeper and a nice addition to the My Little Pony world 
I bought this after reading the reviews that were positive for this little gym. At 3 months of age he does enjoy kicking the gym and getting the music started. My sister-in-law says while yes it is loud, it isn't anything that seems to be bothersome to my nephew. It gets his attention and keeps it....for a little while at least 
We bought this for our son when he was 2 months old and he has yet to be interested in it. The music is very loud and he has no interest in playing with any of the buttons or objects on it. He does kick it and push it away from him, so I constantly have to push it back towards him. At 4 1/2 months old, he still is not that interested in it, but we keep trying it out each day to see if it will spark an interest. 
this has been a wonderful toy for my son who started using it at 2 months old. it entertains him for a good 15-20 minutes in which time i can get the must do list done. he loves to kick it to make the music play and by 2.5 months he was batting and grabing at the toys. i did have to put a pillow under him to raise him the first couple of months so he could reach. other parents have complained that it moves when their baby kicks it, i just placed it against my coffee table and it doesnt budge. i would love to know however, if anyone has figured out how to adjust the volume. this is a must get 
We were given this as a gift when our son was about 5 months old. He has loved it ever since. First he would lay under it and kick at the toys, then we changed it so he could sit in a Bumbo seat and hit the toys, then we changed it so he could stand at it, now he is walking at 10 months and loves to walk over to it on his own. I think our son was an active guy and probably was destined to be an early walker, but I credit this toy with keeping him interested at many stages of his development and helping us to encourage his interest in standing. It has always been easy to change the set-up of this toy so that he is not bored by it. Whenever we have play dates with other babies, they love it too! After having it in his life for 5 months, he still loves to play with the buttons and rattles. I'm sure he'll continue to use it as he gets older as an art table or something. Highly recommended 
My little one got her fingers stick it the toy. I had to tape it off. Still not a very fun toy at all 
My son likes playing with this toy now that he can sit up on the green bench and play with the buttons. When he was younger and not able to sit, we would put him under it and have him kick the bench. When he was able to kick it hard enough to make it play music, the toy would move across the room because there is no traction on the bottom of it to prevent it from moving. This is a great toy for when the kids are able to actually play, but not a good toy to use as a kicker. 
My oldest daughter received this as a gift when she was three. She spent hours playing with all the dolls and all of their outfits. Five years later, my second daughter (who is now 4) pulled them. She loves them too! She spends so much time picking out costumes and dresses. And my 3 year old niece pulls them out every time she comes over. These are much nicer than the ones I had as a kid! No tabs! They stick with sticky tape that is easily replaced if needed. And the book has many different scenes to place the dolls in. Also there is a nice place in the back of the book to store all the pieces. They go in these little drawers and dressers and closets that fold back into the book and then close with velcro. They can get messy when the girls have every single piece spread out on the table, but they sure have fun! 
This Monopoly game was exactly what I was looking for. I was impressed with the durable wooden property houses and metal player pieces. The "Chance" and "Community Chest" cards are neat too because they are relevant to 1930's history. There are only two things I can think of that they could have done a better job with. First of all, there aren't enough houses and hotels. I played a full-length game with several others, and by the end of the game we were using household jiblets to signify houses and hotels. Secondly, the property prices are not printed on the board. The game comes with a paper sheet that lists property values. It was cumbersome to have to keep referring to and easy to lose track of. 
It is the same as the original but a collector might like it 
Everyone of the kids at my daughter's daycare (she is 1, they are between 15 months and 4) love the smaller version of the monkey. I accidentally bought this bigger version -- but still to rave reviews. He is cuddley (more so than a typical beannie baby) and has a sweet face 
this was a gift to my girl, and she absolutely went giddy for it. She renamed him to Sam, and he rides around in her backseat. It's a cute toy that every monkey lover should love 
Our family truly enjoys the Rush Hour game and tried this one as well - it is bigger and bulkly and convenient for travel. I alos find the puzzles to be a bit easier. The pieces don't slide as well as Rush Hour 
I knew this game at a friend's house and love it even I was 30 already at that time. I bought several when I went back to visit my family and they all love it. When I told my mom that I would give my brother's 1st grad boy a set, she told me he won't like it since he doesn't like the brain games. But he loves it soon after my sister explain to him the rules and he enjoys to do it. My little one, almost 23 months old now, likes those animals and loves to put all of those animals to the board one by one and kind of learn the size and arrange the place. It's not only for 8 and up 
I bought this for my 6 year old. She played with it for an hour the first time. It is a game she can play solo. After using the Junior cards, she went on to the beginner. She is still progressing. This is a great thinking game. I highly recommend it 
This game is so much fun!Let me tell you a secret about this game.You can look on the back of the cards to get clues to beat the level that your playing if your stuck.So this game is so fun 
My 7-year-old daughter loves this activity. There are so many active toys available, but Binary Toys has the best strategic-play games around. We play together often with this toy; I find it as much fun as she does. But, she would just as soon sit at the kitchen counter playing it by herself. We take it on trips, and all the relatives enjoy it, too. Since the "solution" shown on the back of each card is straightforward to follow for an adult but not for a child, she is never tempted to turn the card over and "cheat." Instead, through trial and error, she eventually escapes the safari and moves to the next card. Having the wide range of skill level cards helps keep everyone interested. Having the handy cloth case for storage is appreciated as well 
Forklift works, load attaches with magnet. Although Trix is a lesser Bob the builder character, my son does play with the take along Trix. Has the honor of being included with other toys in clay, dirt, water, concrete. After 2 months HARD play holding up well 
This toy is great as an instant source of fun because it assembles very easily and quickly. It opens up big but stores flat, another advantage. My only reservation is that the frame may get bent with alot of active use 
We bought this product for my 2 year old son for his birthday. He absolutely loves it! He and my 5 year old son can play for hours with it 
My 3 year old loves to play in it and he even has a fire hat to go with the truck. He put it over his toddler bed and had a tent to sleep in too 
This product is great. Good design and easy to store. Kids love it 
Looove this toy!!! We would highly recommend it...Our three year old loves playing with it, in addition to it being a fire truck, my son has used his imagination and has made it into a Mail Truck, an Ice Cream Truck, a Bus, and it makes a great tent when we put a sheet over it. It is very flexible and sturdy. I also love the fact when we are finished playing with it, it easily folds up into a compact package and can be put away. It will easily fit into our suitcase and plan to take it when we go visit grandma over vacation!! 
I gave this to my youngest nephew for Christmas, and just received an email from my brother stating that my nephew plays in it all the time. As his daddy is a volunteer fireman, he likes to emulate him in every way. This is a great product and I'd highly recommend it to anyone 
I bought 2 of these (and a school bus) for Christmas presents for boys ages 4, 5 and 6. Talk about being the hit of the day! Very easy to set up (they basically just pop open) and put away. The kids loved them and hey, they can use their imaginations! 
My 20-month-old son adores his fire engine. It is extremely durable and I have little fear of it tearing, even when our golden retriever tries to get inside to play, too! I love that it easily folds up to a very compact size that I can just slide behind the couch for the next day and don't have to leave it up at all times when he's not playing with it like other similar products. I wanted to point out that this product IS made of quality nylon, not plastic like an old review states. There was no toxic smell whatsoever when we took it out of the box or went inside it. The windows and openings are not covered with plastic either so there is plenty of air circulation. There are two openings on top, and 4 or 5 windows, plus a crawl door in back and a full size door on the side. Both are just hanging nylon doors that you can roll up and tie if you choose so they are not in the way. The "floor" of the fire engine is also completely open so if your tot trips and knocks it over, they won't be trapped inside. It is very lightweight so kids should take care not to lean on the sides, just like any other tent-type toy. My son enjoys pushing it around the house because it is so light. It's also a great place for stashing all his toys. He loves to piles up his favorite toys inside! It holds it shape very well despite all the play time it receives. I think it's a steal at this price for hours of open-ended play and endless potential as your child grows 
We gave this to our son for his fourth birthday and he loves it! It's so easy to set up and folds up flat in just a couple minutes 
MY GRANSON LOVED HIS LAPTOP HOWEVER HE KEEPS THINKING ITS A NEW CHAIR. WHEN HE GETS OLDER HE WILL KNOW WHATS ITS FOR. I THINK IT IS A GREAT STARTER LAPTOP FOR ALL CHILDREN 
This is an excellent toy. I am very pleased with it. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my son. I got a bonus because my nearly six year old loves it too. I must say that the six year old is too advanced for the skills it teaches, but it is good reinforcment. Four would be about the right age. This toy teaches the pre-kindergarten skills such colors, shapes, counting, alphabet, etc. The pooh characters are adorable. The lid closes and the handle for carrying is convenient. I would highly recommend this toy 
I got this because my daughter wanted me to get a toy laptop for her baby son, because he keeps trying to grab theirs. Most of the modes are too advanced for him (he's not one yet), but even at his age you can set it to "music" and it will play a different tune for every letter or set it to "letter sounds" and when you push a letter, the letter comes up on the screen, it says the letter and the sound it makes. He will have fun with the other games later. The price seems to have gone way up since I ordered it for 44.75 - Look around before you bu 
I actually found this at Marshall's for a lot cheaper and was glad since my child rarely wanted anything to do with it. I got it to help entertain him in the car ~11 months but it only frustrated him with the poor attchment sites. He kicked it off quickly. At home, as he has gotten older, he occasionally picks up the phone to "talk" on it but since there are few noises, he got bored quickly. He's almost two and it just kept collecting dog hair and dust on it. I tried attaching it in his crib which secured better but he ripped it off too. Overall I would not recommend it for the car and most kids probably would get bored with it too. We'll see when my second arrives this year 
In general this was an ok product. It was too big clumsy for the car but my son liked to play with it in the house. It would be a good buy at $15 but no more than that 
I was expecting something nice looking, something that looks like 30$ or so worth. But instead we get this cheap looking cloth made crappy thing. The baby never liked it. I wouldnt pay more than $5 for this item. I think its a scam, they make people think its so good but then you get that. Please dont buy it or you will be disappointed. Thanks 
we received this toy as a gift for a 1 year old daughter who liked to pretend she was driving. it didn't attach to a 20lb+ car seat. so obviously, it didn't stay in our child's lap for very long, and it would drop to the side. it wasn't entertaining either. we ended up selling it at a garage sale for $1. and instead we bought the mickey mouse driving wheel roadster that lights up and plays tunes, and it was an instant hit 
A fun toy that gives young children something to do in the car 
This parachute is alot of fun. My kids love to play with the parachute. Not only do they play with friends, but it has become a family fun game. My kids love to see howlong they can keep a ball bouncing on it. Durable and easy to store 
We're really satisfied w/ our purchase, this is not expensive as the other ones and made of excellent material, hours of fun!! 
This is an incredibly versatile and durable toy for all ages 
I bought this parachute to use with my kids and my neighbors, which will happen come spring. I also run a moms group at my local library and bring it with me most weeks. The kids are all 3 and under and love it each time we use it. They help hold it, run under it, stand under it and get static hair and even sit on it and we spin them around singing songs. It is very large, and great for a group of kids. I would recommend to all. Enjoy! 
My two year old son fell in love with parachutes during his Gymboree play classes. After just a few weeks, I decided that I needed one for home so we could continue the fun there and invite the neighborhood children to join in. All kids love parachutes and there is so much you can do with them. He loves being dragged around the house in it, hiding under it, using it to send one of his teddy bears flying through the air and making it go up and down with the other kids. The only reason that this product receives three stars is that it was smaller than I expected. The product dimensions are clearly stated but I had difficulty transferring those dimensions into how it would work. It is difficult for the kids to run under the parachute because it is so small. Very good for the price but I will need to buy a larger one 
This parachute is a lot of fun! Kids come up with all kinds of uses for it, but our favorite game is to put the baby underneath the parachute in the middle and just pull it up and down. He gets a kick out of it and the older kids love to see his reaction. This one is bigger than I thought it would be, which is a good thing, but unfortunately we actually don't have enough people to play with it when my husband is not home. If each person holds onto 2 handles it can fit about 5-6 people around. But if you have only 3 people to play with, while it still works, it's more fun with more people. But I guess that's the way all games/toys should be! Definitely recommend this for outdoor (or indoor with a lot of room) activities with lots of kids 
For the past several years I have vollunteered at my kids' school for their anual field day, and I am always assigned the parachute activity. From grades K-5 most kids chose this as their favorite. There are so many games and activities for this simple parachute, I even enjoy them with the kids. So of course I had to buy one for home. I have three kids ages 8, 7, and 3; we all have fun together 
We used this at our daughter's 3rd birthday party and the kids loved it. It is very durable and fun 
With parachute play, we had campers ranging from two years old to over 60, and everyone was able to participate- together. Little ones ran under the billowing, bright nylon. They played with a giant beach ball under the covering like they had their own live forthouse, then we put the ball on top to see how many consecutive times we could cooperatively toss it from the parachute's center, then catch it to send it aloft again. Game possibilities are endless. Having ten sturdy, comfortable web handles all around the edges made it manageable for big and little hands alike. The parachute packs up small and light in its accompanying nylon bag, so we could use it as filler play for 5 minutes between activities, take it to the beach for anytime to warm up from the water, and even tote it on our hike to use as instant shade when draped over a piece of string strung between two trees! Every family taking a road trip should have one of these as standard travel gear along with a soft frisbee and a kickball. One unexpected benefit: This is a perfect solution if you're looking for a colorful, lively photo op to advertise a camp, children's program, cooperation seminar, or just to capture a memory that will make your heart smile 
Skip load flips to reveal another color to signify load is dumped. Doesn't really help to explain the roll of a skip loader to my son. But my son plays HARD with his take alongs and Skip has endured 2 months of HARD play in water, clay, dirt, and on concrete and is still in great shape. For a lesser character, its a last one to buy if you have the money or like the character. 2 stars for education as it doesn't really teach the roll of a skip loader in construction and no magnets 
This joystick is a wonderful blast from the past. It plugs in easily to any tv and was a great attraction at our last party. I got it for my husband for his birthday and it was definitely the gift of the year! Everyone wants one... 
I used to play Galaga forever in the arcades when I was 12. When I plugged this in and played it I couldn't put it down all over again! I have Playstation, I have XBox, I love video games. But there's nothing like going back to the basics. My six year old and three year old ask me to play it all the time. The fun is not lost on them even though they play games on the computer and on the Playstation, games with far more detailed graphics and storylines. Truly a bargain 
I think this game is great. I remember playing it at the arcade in the early 80's. My sister and I were addicted to it. After a while it faded away and we missed it. My daughter bought me this game and I was so like a kid again. I am enjoying it to the hilt. It is definately worth the money that it cost, which was surpisingly inexpensive. I recommend it highly, especially for those who remember it back when. 
Very portable, inexpensive, quality product. Plays just like the arcade and is just as difficult so you wont get bored of it quickly. Get more than one because it is an excellent gift idea and you wont want to part with yours, it's that good 
This is a great game system to pick up and take with you on a trip. I use this on call with an old tv with mono input av jacks. This gaming system has MS. Pac Man, Pole Position, Galaga, Mappy, and Xevious, all classic arcade games. Ms Pac Man is true to the arcade, and has the feel of it as well with this controler. Pole position is the closest I've seen to the arcade version, with the joystick turing as a steering wheel (very neat). Mappy is an interesting game of an mouse trying to nap a cat on the loose in a museum. Galaga is a lot like space invaders, with more difficult ships to blow up, and xevious places you behind the helm of a spaceship flying over land, blowing up enemies (a lot like tiger heli for nintendo). very cool system, great value from around 6-12 dollars. Worth picking up. Much better than some games available today. Four AA batteries, then plug and play, Family friendly!! 
Bought this puzzle for my [...] and [...] grandsons. They loved it, particularly the younger boy. It is a beautiful and sturdy puzzle 
Of the floor puzzles we have bought, this one has the thickest cardboard, the glossiest surface, and the most vibrant colors 
My 4 yr old daughter loves dinosaurs, but not puzzles so much. She does like this puzzle though, because the large, sturdy pieces fit together well and stay where they are put. Also, the bright pictures make finding the right pieces easy and matching colors fun. All the kids are impressed with the size when the puzzle's complete. Also, the cardboard box has held up as well as the pieces, but the puzzle comes with a paper insert picture to use when putting together, just in case. 
I just recently bought this item for my younger sister who is actually studying Psychology... needles to say she loved it! From the hilarious packaging including some of his most notable quotes to his phallic cigar, this item makes the perfect gift for anyone interested in Psychology, whether they agree with Freud's theories or not. The seller did also a great job in packaging and shipping it so the box came in perfect conditions, as my sister obviously sees this as a collector piece to be placed in her office... =) And yeah, he looks like the typical movie villain, cigar included... 
This toy is lots of fun. I like to play with it using my old GIJOE toys. My favorite scenario is to have Sigmund Freud kill off Cobra Commander, and then take his place as leader of Cobra: The Enemy. With his cigar, he works really well as an evil villain. (Plus, he likes to torture the good guys that they capture by tying them up and putting his cigar out on their bare chest.) It is lots of fun to play with. The final battle usually takes place on the rug at the foot of my bed (which substitutes for a jungle), where Snake-Eyes challenges Sigmund Freud to a duel in order to avenge the death of Duke and all the other Joes. (Snake-Eyes is always the only surviving Joe left.) Sigmund Freud then tries some ninja moves to kick Snake-Eyes' rear, but Snake Eyes beats the crap out of him. It finally ends with Snake Eyes using his sword to gut Sigmund Freud, as his sword slowly slides out of his bloody entrails. It really is a lot of fun! Sometimes I do a Transformer Crossover Universe, where Megatron comes in and has Sigmund Freud join him in some plot to obtain energy in order to build the ultimate weapon and take control the universe. The Joes always have to go get help from Optimus Prime, who always puts a stop to this plot just at the last minute, but not before his arm gets chopped off in battle. (I am actually missing Optimus' arm in real life, so that's why this always happens in the story.) Anyways, Sigmund Freud is great fun for the whole family! Especially 10-year-olds (and above). Buy it today 
This hilarious line of "action figures" only gets funnier and funnier as more and more of them become available. I bought the Freud action figure for my mother, a therapist who agrees with just about nothing that Freud ever said, and she now has it placed in her office, sardonically, of course. This makes a great gift for your favorite mental health professional, whether they love or loathe the man. Either way, it's funny 
As we fill up the house, the kids are having great fun with this room, playing mom dad do the laundry 
The loving people dollhouse is so cute! My daughter pretend plays with hers all the time!!! The furniture like this one is so realistic and has things that move and such which make play time even more fun! They are built to last. I never have to fix these toys which is a nice change from most toys! GREAT TOY 
Got this toy for my daughter for Christmas. Both she and my son loved it, but it only comes with 8 or so pieces of cardboard and you go through them quickly. I bought refills, which were hard to find locally and they also last about 5 minutes. As other reviewers have said, get your own cardboard, any neon color works well, and use one of the original pieces as a stencil to cut them out. It's much cheaper than buying the refills if you don't mind a little bit of extra work. I bought regular cardboard which curled up after they came off the toy, but we can put a book on them when they are dry to flatten them out. Cleaning isn't too bad either. Just a couple of papertowels and voila! It's clean and ready to be used again. 
My duaghter who is 3 1/2 years old got this toy from her grandmother. I was a little hesitant at first. I remember something similar when I was child and it made for massive clean up when done. So I have been putting it off getting out for my daughter. Who has asked me non stop for the last two months. I kept saying it was special toy for a special day. Her not knowing I just didn't want to deal with the hassel of the whole thing. Well I got it out today. It's humid and raining and I thought I can't put it off forever. THis toy is great. It was so much fun and really there was hardly any mess. I instructed her less is more on a project like this but I don't think it made a difference. With each paper change I did wipe it down with a wet paper towel and that was it. They think it's super cool because you use it with all the lights off. It's also nice because it comes with the batteries. This is a real winner. I highly recommend this toy and don't put off playing with it either like I did. 
I bought this toy for my daughters birthday (3) and everyone in the family loves it, her father had to make a picture of his own while the both of them argued over whose turn it was 
I bought this for my oldest daughter who is 10 for this past Christmas, and I have to admit that I was worried it was for younger children. She loves it !! 
This has got to be one of the best things i ever bought my kids!!!!!!!!!!! Even the adults loved it and we have found that you dont only have to use the paper we even put 4x4 household floor tiles on it making sure they were centered and the kids painted them not only with the paint that came with the thing but with the paint you find in any craft store. then we sprayed them with clear spray paint and you can use them for coasters or as i am gonna do use them for a back splash made by my kids. This is a MUST BUY TOY FOR ALL AGES my 4 year old grandson was even able to use this with no problem, and they have ran the thing for many hours and it is still using the same batteries that it came with. 
My 7 year old son absolutely loves this toy. It doesn't come with much paper; however, I bought black card stock at Michaels arts and crafts store and cut it to size...now he is back in business. As the paper spins, the music plays (you can also turn the music off), and the black light in the background makes the neon colors glow(especially in the dark). The effect of the glowing, spinning artwork is amazing!! With this toy, anyone can be an artist!! 
We found the prices on the internet way too high, but our daughter loves the movie, and this is one item she felt she could wait to get (she is 3). Well, we wandered into Walmart, and got it for a LOT less than on here, and she has played with it (the three cars with it she had avoided buying other ways) ever since. Mack can pop off his trailer just like in the movie. For us, one other advantage is that my in-laws have a car hauling business, and Mack looks nearly like thier trucks. They have a part to thier trucks that goes over the cab and right behind that allows 3 more cars to fit on. But, the way the truck works is accurate enough for loading and offloading cars. Anyhow, for our daughter, that is an added bonus that it looks like the trucks she has seen all her life. I definitely recommend the set for those interested. But, I think anything over $25 is too high for the way it is made is all 
I just got this for my 3-year-old son. He loves it! I bought it at Wal-mart for $19.95. Great deal because it comes with 3 cars. This truck doesn't have closed panels like the real Mack in the movie, but my son can use his little fingers to push cars all the way in through the open wall. I think this is much more fun than the real version. 
I'd actually like to give it zero stars. The photo makes this product look like a decent sized truck when in fact it's a fraction of the size. Excellent example of false advertising. I guess the "1/32" was the clue that this was NOT in fact a full-sized toy. I recommend you stay away or the recipient will be disappointed, as mine was. I will no longer be buying toys via this method 
My 3 year old loves this book. The games are fun and easy for a preschooler. His favorite is matching the fish and echo cave. He likes the Spongbob book much more that the book that came with the leap pad unit. My five year old has a leap pad plus writing system and tons of books, but he will get this one out and play with it once in a while too. I highly recomend this one!! 
I love the My First LeapPad system and my son has so much fun using it. Unfortunatly, the SpongeBob Square Pants Best Friend Adventures I purchased was defective. What I first noticed was that the pages were just a tad too wide to fit into the system. I could tell from comparing it to other books that there was extra space on one side. I tried to remedy this myself by shaving off a tiny bit to make it fit into the system. Once it fit and we tried out the book I found that all the sensors or touchpoints were way off, an inch or so in some cases. I called the companies customer service department and through the conversation also found that the pages were out of order and possibly missing. The gentleman was very nice and helpful and sent me a replacement book. But that book didn't fit! And it had the same problem with the pages being out of order. I have emailed the company and asked to have a replacement with a completely different title. I think 2 defective books of the same title is enough of a hassle and we will move onto a new one. This was the only book we have had trouble with. All the other titles have fit and worked just fine for us. Kudos for their customer service department though! 
We have at least five other Leap Pad books, but this one is by far my son's favorite. The activities are better too (we just love composing music on the "Get Ready to Rock" page). I'd definitely recommend it 
I'm not sure what the people are talking about with the three foot radius. That's how mine were at first, but I finally figured out how to make them work. They are more or less of the average 2 mile radius. I wouldn't expect too much, come on people! These are KID's toys! They aren't going to give a 7 yr. old a pair of hundred dollar talkies, now would they? The main trouble was getting the battery. After we had the batteries in, it came the testing time. They work pretty well, Except if it is below 60 or 50 degrees. Then, Only one will work, and not even that well. But, I have figured out how to make them quiter without turning them off! Hold you're hand over the mouth piece really tightly... It should elimanate most of the static. But, for ten dollars, these are a very good pair. I am however saving up for the Uniden Ten mile radius 20 dollar adult walkie talkies 
We bought these for my son, who was very eager to have a pair of working walkie-talkies. They work well, at a substantial distance, HOWEVER, when you are not actually speaking into them (i.e.,pressing the 'talk' button) they emit a continuous, loud, unbearable static noise. With all of today's technology, it's hard to believe they couldn't manufacture something better 
Don't buy these. They don't work at all. Even just a few feet away, all you'll hear is static and not even a hint of the other person's voice. I purchased a pair at a brick-and-mortar store, and returned them 
My son (5 yrs) recieved this for Christmas. The neighborhood girls love to play it with him. We also have sleepovers of 4 extra boys ranging from the age of 3 yrs to 7 years and they ALL loved it. We put a heavy book on each side of the end of the track, like the directions say, and it works great. We also put a pillow in front/behind the door to keep it from moving. These kids have gone so far as to make a cardboard target and place it so they can 'get points' each time it comes Zooooming down and hits it. We get big screams when the cardboard'ring of fire' is used and the car goes thru without hitting it(this comes with the set). This elevator is a great invention. The only thing I would change is the grey piece under the track that holds the end of the track up. It often comes loose and the car will jump off the end straight instead of jumping up. I guess we will tape it until we get more track to add to this baby. Great FUN! 
My son received this for his 4th birthday. He and his older brother, age 8, have spent lots of afternoons playing with this toy and trying out all of our cars. They have a great time and I think this is a great product, much better than some of the other hot wheels tracks we have gotten in the past. This would make a great gift 
My 5 year old received this for Christmas. We set it up and it works fine. He has no problem getting the cars up to the top to launch. We have moved it to different doors with no problems. We did tape the bottom of the ramp to the floor so it would stay further away from the door. This created a much better jump with the cars. 
My husband bought two of these for my sons(ages 3 and 2) to play with. Both of them had a lot of fun with it and both were able to maneuver the pully system with no problem. The oldest kid(hubby, age 32) had as much fun with it as the little ones. 
WE got this last week - nothing has broken - it was easy to assemble, it's been moved around the house to different doors. I say this is on of these 'sets' hot wheels got right! I have three boys ages 4,6 and 8 playing with this toy 
My son wrote the first review right after we got the V-drop. He loved playing with it for 1 day but then the device that brings the car up to the top stopped working. I couldn't believe it. He suggested that we bring it back to the store so we could get something else. So that's what we did, but I said no more hot wheels stuff for awhile. This was one of many Hot Wheels birthday presents. 
It is easy to assemble. It is a lot of fun. Most of my cars work on it and I have 70 Hot Wheels cars. I got this for a 6th birthday present. I wanted to write a review because I wanted to be the first person to write a review of this toy. My name is Andy and my mom helped me write this 
We are a family that loves games! This game appears to be educational, but has NOT been fun to play. The little tiles aren't easy to deal with, and the cheap plastic set-up leaves much to be desired. Save your money and play hangman on the chalk board 
A good game that basically facilitates the pencil and paper game. It's no real change from a simple piece of paper but it makes it fun for my 7 year old who just loves it 
The tiles are NOT see through---they may have upgraded them. The game is GREAT for the kids. I've got two little ones that love to practice their spelling and my husband and I end up joining them. It's fun, educational and perfect for the whole family. I've very glad I ignored the review saying that they tiles were see through. It's perfect for kids (and grown ups enjoy playing it too!). Very happy I bought it! 
This is a game that all kids of all ages would love to pla 
You can totally see through my tiles. I bought mine a couple of years ago. Model number on box says, 04623. Looks to me like there was a bad batch of them made. When I was younger, I had one that was fine. The game is fun, reasonably priced, and educational for the kids as well. I like it because it doesn't take long to play, and several people can all get a turn within an hour. I have written to Hasbro regarding the tiles. Not sure why I waited 2 years to do so, but hopefully they will make good on this problem. 
As it is, you can only create words 8 letters long. They should make it at least 10-12 letters. Some have complained that the tiles can be seen through. It's nonsense - no matter what lighting conditions you CAN'T see through them. Maybe it was a problem in earlier editions, but mine is just fine 
The tiles are transparent. There is absolutely no guessing the word your opponent has chosen because you can see right through the tiles. I took masking tape and put several layers over the back of the tile and I could still see through it. I colored it with a permanent marker and could STILL see through it. My mom can play with my daughter in her basement but that is about it!! Would not recommend this item to anyone unless you have money to throw away 
I read the other reviews and frankly don't agree with them. We didn't have a problem seeing through the tiles and both my 8 and 13 year old are enjoying this game immensely. When my kids played with their 79-yr old great uncle, the age gap narrowed. I do agree that there should be more slots for letters, but hey, make the best of it and enjoy 
That would be for more playing spaces on the trayies of this game. The trayies only have 8 spaces. You may know hangman as a game you can do on the board like if you were playing Wheel of Fortune. The directions says the youngest player goes first. You pick a word, as long as you have space for the whole word. But to begin playing you have to the button on 11, and every time the person you are playing against gets a letter wrong, yuo move the button down one number, to reviel a line, then a another line until you you start seeing a person start to be hanged. If they get the letter(s) right, put the little letters in thier space that you see at the top of the tray. Play goes on into you or the person you are playing against get it right, in less you make your oppentent to contiune playing until either they get it right or they are hanged. This would be a great game to play, whether or not your a good artist 
I got this for my niece who is 2 1/2 and my big Sis called and says she really enjoys it and whenever my sis puts it away while cleaning she always manages to find it and gets it back out to play with. I recommend it! 
I bought this for my niece for Christmas. She's 21 mos. old (almost 2) and it was the first thing she wanted to play with. My sister says she LOVES it and I saw her playing with it at home, 3 weeks after Christmas as well. The pieces are just the right size for little hands and there is enough to do without "electronic overload." Just a very nice toy 
This toy seems unfinished and cheaply made. I got it for $15 at Toys R Us and I certainly wouldn't pay more for it. It is small, doesn't have an on/off switch, and the characters barely look like themselves. It definitely doesn't look like it will last long, just not well made. BUT...my 15 month old daughter loves it. My 3 and 6 year old boys got bored with it really quick but it does keep my daughter's interest. She loves the wiggles. The characters pop up and down when you play they keyboard and it is easy for the little guys to play with it. I hate toys marketed to little kids and it is too hard for them to manipulate it to make it work. The music quality isn't too bad and it does have two different volumes. Not that annoying for the adults. The music only plays for a couple seconds at a time. Not a bad toy but they could have done so much better. 
We bought this toy for my son a year ago when he turned a year old and he absolutely loves it. He still plays with it all the time, especially when he is watching them on T.V. The only problem I have had is figurines are not very durable and sometimes will bend 
I showed my 20 mo. old daughter this at Wal-Mart and she's adored it ever since. It worried me that she forcefully bent back the characters all the time, but 2 months later and they're still going strong. This piano has 8 songs, one by each character. Each bit is 10 seconds long approx. "Wigglegroove" "Rolling Down the SandHills" "Music w/ Murray" "Where's Jeff?" "Vegetable Soup" "All I need is Food" "Play your Guitar w. Murray" and "Calling All Cows". That's more than enough to entertain a child that age. She can follow some of what they're singing like "Clap your hands and spin around". Also it's nice that there are two volume levels so as not to vex harried parents. The worst thing that happened is the toy got a liitle wet underneath and some of the piano keys won't work anymore...she hardly pays with them anyway and will pull the guys and jump along to the recorded songs. For ages 1-3 this toy is fun, if your kid loves the Wiggles like mine does. 
I like the handle to carry this keyboard around, but it is kind of awkward for little ones to use unless it is sitting on a table or other flat object. The characters will set off when they are moved and you get a jumbled mass of sound coming out of it if it is resting against something that causes the characters to be pushed in all at once. I know my 2 year old does not like to be sitting still, so using this on a table is not really an option for her. And because of the height of the characters, it is not a good "bring along" toy since it doesn't fit in a bag well. For the same price, go with the Wiggles Guitar. It has many more buttons and songs and they can carry it around and play it at the same time 
My son received this as a gift for his 3rd birthday. It was easy to put together and I was impressed with the attention to detail on this toy. The doors and decals mainly. There are several small parts that can easily be put in a plastic bag and put away. It has been over a year and this airplane still "flies" around our house. My son loves it. The only reason that this review is not carrying 4 stars is due to a minor annoyance. The tail section and the wheels seem to always be coming off. They are easily snapped back on but it is irritating to be fixing the bloody thing every 5 minutes. As my son has gotten older I have taught him how to fix it himself. I guess the key thing here is that the toy can be fixed. I would rather snap the thing back together than deal with a truly broken toy 
Our son loves this toy. The details are accurate, the size is ideal for a small child, and because of a very study design, it is practically indestructible! I only wish playmobil made more models. (yes, there are many small parts that we have added back as he has grown into the toy- also a great point- it is sophisticated enough to last more than 6-8 months 
After reading the other mediocre reviews for this airplane, I felt I had to write in to tell of our experience with it. We bought it for my older son's third birthday THREE YEARS AGO. It was his favorite toy for over a year, and he still plays with it on a regular basis, incorporating it into his now elaborate playmobil schemes. Also, our younger son is now three and it has been HIS favorite toy for months now. The airplane is still in mint condition despite all the vigorous use it gets, and we have somehow managed not to lose all the fun accessories (alright, a juice box and a mug or two are AWOL, but the rest is still in regular use). The fact that the wings and tail break off easily is intentional and brilliant, in my opinion, because otherwise the airplane would have broken into shards and been ruined from its frequent "flights". By the time my older son was four, he could easily snap it back together himself. No other toys in our household encourage the amount of imaginative play that the playmobil toys do, and this one has always been the boys' (and my) favorite! Any preschooler will thank you for this toy 
My 3-year-old grandson loved this; the only problem with it is that it breaks apart a little easily when he plays a little hard with it. It is beautifully designed and in a few months he should be able to handle it a little more carefully. Playmobil makes great toys 
The Playmobil products are nice and fun, BUT you must realize that every single piece of every single object comes apart. The hair pieces come off of the pilot and stewardess's head; the wheels come off, the airplane door comes off; the wings and tail comes off in many different pieces; the steering wheel comes off; and, there are many small pieces inside which you will never find after you child plays with it once. I would LOVE this product if I could get it to stay in one piece. I used the strongest glue I could find to keep the pieces in their respective places, but to no avail. The other Playmobil products are the same way. My 4 year old loves this plane, but he is also frustrating by having lost most of the little pieces. Such a disappointment 
I purchased this for myself -- an adult -- for a cross-country flight. Used it about six times, and realized that one important reason for why I love Hangman is the interaction I get playing with it with my son. However, this does deliver what you'd expect, and I think younger people would enjoy it under the right circumstances (being alone, bored, on a trip, waiting for the doctor, etc.) 
The excitement of a handheld for the kids, the wholesomeness I look for. 
This is an okay game, though it sometimes gets a little boring. This game can teach kids different words. There are 8 categories to choose from, plus you can choose how many letters you want in the game. You get 11 guesses to guess what word they are giving you 
I purchased this for my kids trip to Texas. We have used them prior to them going and the kids enjoy the game. For an adult it is somewhat easy, even on the 3rd level and 7 letters. But ofcourse it is for kids. I think it is good for the kids for a change they are trying to spell instead of your normal video games 
I bought this game for my daughter because she always wanted us to play Hangman in restaurants while waiting to be served. Sometimes, I preferred adult conversation. Giving her this hand held, single player game gave me this option. But, I found myself asking for "my turn" to play. There are a variety of ways to play. All are fun 
This was so fun to see my son on this. It is perfect for older kids. The quality is great. The size is perfect for older kids, as well as three year olds. The bucket works great, the chain is encased, and the trailer is an added bonus we loved. Now yard work is easy to include the kids. The stickers don't like to stay on, but after a couple years with my houligans, the stickers won't be on it anyway. We just put them on for Christmas pictures anyway, they do add all the finishing touches 
I really enjoyed seeing my 3 children enjoying this toy. All three are under 5 years so this was a perfect fit. As I said, fun for the kids. Putting this together was easier done by common sense than the confusing instructions. This product is made of plastic and semi durable springs. The front end loader is good for my son carrying my daughters toys away from them, but not feasible doing much good when outside. (I mean, thats what tractors are for, playing in the dirt.) The tires are not good for grass, they slip and will not get a grip. It becomes the family pushing toy instead of one driven by chain. I can say it is fun for the children, I give it 5 stars for fun. Will it be around, Durability wise, we will see.. 
Me and my husband bought this for our 2 year old son for christmas. and after reading the reviews on this website, i had told him that it would more than likely be hard to put together. so he wasnt looking forward to that on christmas eve. but when he opened the box to put it together, he said the instructions were perfectly clear to him. he didnt have a problem putting it together at all. our son loved it. and it is big enough to where he will get plently of use out of it as he grows. my husband said that the seat also adjusts for the kids. i havent seen anything about this on amazon, so maybe we got an updated version. i dont know. but my son loves it! 
This is a great toy for your young buckaroo.(and a great price!) The downside- putting it together. Adding the scoop is a bit tricky as the picture instructions don't show the exact screw to use to hold it in place. (The word instructions are awful! Obviously, the writing of the manual did not test it with a user to build! They must have been trying to save paper 
This toy was purchased as a birthday gift for our 5-yr old son. Great toy. The instructions are another story. We bought the pedal type for the exercise value of the item. It has a scoop/lift in front and a trailer on the back for lots of yard fun/work. I'm an RN and have put a multitude of toys together over the years. My husband is an engineer and has built our home, our son's "treehouse" bed with a multitude of safety features, fixes people's air conditioners and computers after the experts fixed them and they still don't work, etc... We are both use to reading and following assembly instructions. (Have three children grown and married.) Basically saying, we're not rocket scientists but we are reasonably intelligent people. The instructions come written as words and as drawings to show the assembly. No where are the parts identified as what they are or how many are included. There is a parts list if you need to reorder something. Part 4 (shown on drawing) is SPST3215N. The instructions don't assemble it by numbers, just by name. ("Insert screw, attach retainer".) There are assorted screws of different lengths. The instruction will simply read "Insert screw..." You wing it on this one and hope to select the right screw. Instuction number nine reads "Insert a retainer in the special device." Seriously, "the special device". No where is it identified what the special device is. I started it, my husband finished it and it's together and working with only one mystery part left. Our son is enjoying it and loves helping in the yard even more now. Great toy! Poorly written instructions. The people who wrote the instructions should return their salary for the hours, days or weeks they they were employed to write these instructions. Very poor job 
MY SON RECEIVED THIS LAST CHRISTMAS WHEN HE WAS 6 MONTHS OLD. WE KEEP IT IN HIS CRIB AND TILL THIS DAY WHEN HE WAKES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, INSTEAD OF CRYING FOR A BOTTLE OR JUST FOR US TO COME GET HIM HE PLAYS WITH THIS TOY! IT IS A BIG LAUGH IN OUR FAMILY BECAUSE AT LEAST 4 NIGHTS A WEEK WE HEAR HIM PLAYING "HIS PIANO" AS WE CALL IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!! HE ENTERTAINS HIMSELF TILL HE GOES BACK TO SLEEP- WHAT A RELIEF FOR US! MY BROTHERS 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER STILL WAKES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, SO I SUGGESTED HE RUN OUT AND GET THIS TOY! I LIKE PLAYING WITH IT ALSO, AND THE COLOR AND LIGHTS ARE VEYR NICE. IT IS NOT LOUD AND ANNOYING LIKE SOME TOYS. IT IS ALSO PRETTY DURABLE. 1 YEAR AND STILL GOING STRONG 
Our 3 year old granddaughter is full of spunk and needed an outlet since they have no yard. This toy is enjoyed by their whole family! Since they live above an older woman, they are careful with the settings, tho. Enjoy! Diane Tavegi 
Our grandchildren, ages 4 and 6, enjoy the Musini as the sensitivity is adjustable and the music responds to their footsteps on either carpet or concrete floor. Their two cousins of similar age also have a Musini, a favorite toy for an individual or a group. That's why I've ordered a another Musini for the 3 yr old only child whose home has deep carpet. 
I have a nine year old and an eight month old and I think I am the one spending the most time with our Musini. I actually loved it so much I bought another two for a couple of our friends. The three of them see a lot of use on pretty much a daily basis with no sign of any difficulties whatsoever. I have my eight month old stand (with my help) in front of the unit and we dance away! My nine year old and I dance around it until we fall down laughing. We all have a great time switching up the tunes and taking turns acting crazy. We love our Musini 
My 3 year old got this for Christmas. Seemed like a neat idea until he figured out if he picked it up it was just a really great, big tamborine. It also just encourages my kids to get wound up. The faster they move, the more wild the music. We never use it, and I'm just waiting for the appopriate amount of time to pass before I can sell it on E-Bay 
My 3-year-old daughter loves this toy. She enjoys stopping and starting to make the music play. I dance with her and get a little workout. This toy has worked great since we got it for Christmas. We use it on a carpeted floor with no problems. Though it has gotten some bad reviews, I say it is worth the purchase. You can always return it 
If you are in the minimize-mess, maximize thinking and motion mode, this is a great toy. The box says 3 and up, but our twins are 2 1/2 and love it. I think they could have been enjoying this 6 months ago. It is so much fun to see them discovering that they can make the music and tempo go according to their motions. I like it too. You'll find me dancing around it after bedtime! It is just 1 piece so there is no mess involved, but it really gets the kids moving and experimenting. I bought this over a year ago on a closeout sale online somewhere for about $15 and I just recently got it out. What a deal for a great toy. I have had no problems getting it to work correctly 
I had trouble getting this product to work, but that was only because I was too eager to play and hadn't read the enclosed instructions. Initially, I set the sensitivity all the way to 10 and was frustrated when it didn't work at all. The instructions say to turn down the sensitivity until the lights turn off. Once I did that, it worked great. With the sensitivity too high, it was interpreting everything as one constant movement and not picking up on the changes, so it wasn't identifying my movements. Now that I understand the instructions, I can get it to work anywhere. It is such an great toy, you can't not buy this one 
This is an awesome toy. I bought it for my kids and they love it. They played with it for hours. Easy to build and easy instructions. Would definetly buy it again and may even buy a second one. 
This game brings back great memories from the 70's. The only downside is it does take a few minutes to set up. Otherwise: lots of fun, inexpensive, much better than TV 
We got this game for something new to do with the family after Thanksgiving Dinner. This is a great game if you are looking for something that just about any age can play. The only limitation is that only 4 can play at a time. We overcame this by playing teams. 
This is supposed to be a smaller version of the original game - for those who want the original try "Super Kerplunk Game" not much difference - just more durable. This particular game takes a little time to set up - count that as part of the game - delegate - first person puts in the first 10 sticks etc. etc. I LOVE THIS GAME 
This game is pretty fun but it takes forever to put it together before you can play it. My 5 year old wants to play the game immediately. Not wait 10 minutes for mommy to get it ready.They now have an electronic Ker plunk game. We will be purchasing that one soon 
When I got Kerplunk home and opened the box, I was dumbfounded. The game was this little plastic thing made from cheap materials. As a kid, we had Kerplunk and it was much taller and wider. It was made of a heavier plastic, too. You could be extra careful when you removed the straws because the whole thing was solid and wouldn't budge. The new one is so little, you have to hold it with one hand while you pull the straw, making it difficult to move carefully. I think this is the same type of problem parents are having with retro games. The toy manufacturers know the parent will say, "I had this game when I was a kid, so I'll buy it for my kid!" Unfortunately, the new versions are smaller, cheaper and more fragile. If the original version of a game is what is desired, then a parent will have to buy an old game from Ebay. This is actually a cool game, just not the new version 
I was so looking forward to playing this with my kids. I have a 9 and 3yr. old, big age difference and hard to find games that we can all play, so I thought Kerplunk would be perfect. The older one would have fun and it was something the little one could play without having to stop and have mommy read the card to tell her what to do next. Boy was I wrong. First of all while trying to put the thing together, where the top and bottom were suppose to fit perfectly together, they didn't, the sticks that are suppose to go through the tiny holes couldn't because the top and bottom would not stay on right and some of the holes were closed up. The sticks were also really flimsy as was the two big top and bottom pieces. I remember when I was younger and played it wasn't this soft plastic, it was hard and durable. In the end we tried to play, the first time after the second stick was pulled all the marbles fell out so I never even got the chance to play. The second and last time we tried the top fell completely off! Maybe, I just picked the wrong box but I won't try to convince myself of it by buying another one 
This is a truly great game and underscores the adage "keep it simple, stupid"! All ages can play...even my 2 year old can pull out a stick and see if made a marble fall. I have only one complaint...the quality of the physical aspect of the game. Of course I had Kerplunk as a kid and the tube and tray &amp; sticks were much heavier plastic. With this Kerplunk you must hold the tube to pull a stick out or the whole shebang will fall over. Maybe an original classic version will be produced. I have noticed this same skimping on other great games such as "trouble" and "don't break the ice" etc...I would pay a few more dollars for better quality but suggest you buy it "as is" anyway 
This game is great for those as young as 2 and a half and so far as old as 69! The adults love it because of the short set up time and short length of game play. Usually an adult will be willing to play it three or four times in a row! The kids love the suspense of waiting for the marbles to kerplunk and giggle greatly when they do. The sticks do bend when toddlers treat them too rough but none have ever broken. Our family often plays it on friday family fun night 
I bought this for my office. We are a group of sales reps so we get many little desk toys from our vendors but nothing to really use as an outlet for stress. This works perfectly. It's bright and cheery and adds a fun element to the office space. We had a few issues in the beginning with air leaks but after we found them and patched them up, we haven't had any problems. One co-worker, who was out of the office the week Bozo came in, has now "adopted" him and pulled him closer to her cubicle because she thinks it's so funny. It's pretty durable as long as you aren't too rough with it. It probably won't stand up to kicking or jumping on it but hitting it or throwing softer objects at it will not do much to harm it 
My son loves this toy and so does his friends - great punching bag - great quality. 
What a breath of fresh air!.....no batteries. Just 100% enjoyment for our littlest ones, and alot of memories for their parents! Knock Bozo down, sit on him, squeak his nose, and he always pops up smiling!This toy even put a smile on our 13 year old granddaughter's face. 
Product leaked from day 1. Was bought as Christmas present for grandchildren so was not opened right away. Vendor would not allow return even though defective. Would not recommend to anyone 
i had fun punching this for 5 min then i broke it because i ran it over with the car and that's when it squeaked it's last squeak sniff sniff.. 
Absolutely the best I have ever seen-as are all their other gifts.I have 2 grandaughters who enjoyed Xmas........am sure they'll like their birthdays....................Will continue to buy from the 
After being so impressed with the Batman TV, CD Player, and DVD Player, I decided to go out and buy my kid the phone as well. Similar to the other Batman electronics, I found this product to be top notch quality with a fabulous design. It makes a great addition to any boy's room 
I was very pleased with this product and my 5-year grandson loves it! It's colorful, lightweight,easily cleaned and easy for him to carry wherever he goes. He uses it all the time, whether at home or on-the-go. The side pockets are convenient and great for storing his art supplies, small books, or toys. It's helpful in providing a way to keep him occupied during long road trips. Great product that I recommend for any aspiring young artist between the ages of 3 to 6 years 
I'm tired of kids crafts which don't encourage experiment, require you to buy replacement supplies from the company which makes the kit or just make plastic junk. This is one craft which is fun for both kids and parents, has lots of room for experimentation, uses any old paper and the paper you make has so many uses. I also like exposing my kids to traditional crafts and paper making is one of those (also try Alex's weaving looms to expose kids to weaving). And, of course, it allows you to recycle old paper too. Pretty messy but lots of fun 
I gave this set as a birthday gift to my fifteen year old son. It was our first experience with any products from this company. He spent several hours playing with it. He would make different things with it, taking the first creation apart and creating something new. He had lots of fun with this and I would buy another product by this company. My son's only complaint was that their wasn't enough pieces. Nevertheless I felt it was a good value for the money. As a plus it has educational value! It was nice to see him doing something other than watching tv and playing video games. This racing set was a wonderful alternative 
I got this as a gift for my husband. He collects lego's and it is somewhat of a hobby of his. He loved it and couldn't wait to put it together. It is amazing how real it looks!! 
The item is compact so you can take it you. It is also organized built to take the abuse of a 2 4 yr. old child. I highly recommend Melissa Doug Products as well as this puzzle group 
Fantastic gift for boys and girls alike and they can really play without the worry of the puzzle pieces getting bent. Very colorful pictures and easy pieces to hold and work with. Plus, you have a place to keep them when they are not being used. Great price, too 
This is so cool. You can build all kinds of things with the motor they give you. And, the book that comes with it is HUGE, which makes for LOTS of K'Nex fun 
this is the worst product. to much xtra gizmo time date alarm, the screen is not very sensitive. you have to hit it hard w pencil i do not recommend this it is a rip off!!! 
I used to play w/ this puzzle game on the newspaper and then made my way to small booklets that i bought at the bookstore. Eventually my kids and I got 3 electronic handhelds for Christmas and I can't imagine life w/o one of these gizmos. I have nothing bad to say about this unit. Pretty good and easy to use. Great for people who dont want to control using hands and instead using the little pen that comes with the unit. I recommend this product to players 
Very pretty Barbie who is now naked like all of the other Barbies in our house. I'm not sure what else I can say after a statement like that, but she was a welcomed gift for our 5 year old this Christmas 
This is a beautiful doll. I purchased one for my 5yr. old granddaughter and her best friend. They both love her and her pretty spinning dress. They both love princesses and ballet. I am so appreciative that Mattel produces African American version of most of their Barbie dolls. It's so important that our little African American girls have doll that they can identify with also 
I bought this for my girls at the 64% off price, and was pleased with the purchase. She takes 2 AAA batteries, which were not included. The batteries go into each of her thighs. We've had her for 2 weeks, and she's still spinning and lighting up, and gets played with regularly. One thing to note is that if her arms are down, touching the dress at all, the dress will not spin. Her shoes do come off, but my daughters havn't figured that out yet, since they fit so well. She cannot be undressed like other barbies, but she's in a gorgeous princess dress, so my girls don't care in the slightest. When my daughter saw her, she was so very excited to have Genevieve ... until she watched the movie with the barbie. It was at that point that she realised that the movie Genevieve is blonde. The doll is still cool (she does have a medium brown color of hair like my girls), and a lot of fun, but just not quite like the movie. I wish the movies would have more diversity. All in all, for the sale price, I'd highly reccomend it to any 12 Dancing Princesses fans, but I wouldn't have paid full price for any of the 12 dancing princesses dolls. They are fun for the price, but I don't expect the quality to last very long. 
Tried of buckets of dinosaurs? This is a great addition to the box (plus they make a smaller unmoving version which is a great offspring). 
My 4 yo son just LOVES the Imaginext Dinosaur series. Even his 9 yo brother 5 yo sister enjoy playing with them too. The quality is just what you would expect from Fisher-Price. We have almost the entire collection and all the dinosaurs are holding up wonderfully! 
The plastic frame that upgrades this to "deluxe" isn't really necessary or well-made, but otherwise, no complaints at all. Love Yahtzee! It's fun for kids from 9 to 99 
o my gosh! its the best game ever! in the game you just have to be daring enough to bid your money... it a really cool game for the price 
I am the reigning Queen of Yahtzee in our home! We often play this game as a family and think it is alot of fun. Our young son has developed better counting skills because of this game. He is getting advance at planning his game strategy and is now capable at beating his parents on occasion- even at age 6! We enjoy the deluxe edition- the tray keeps the dice contained nicely. We do all sorts of silly "good luck" moves such as blowing on the die, shaking the container a certain way or just plain yelling out the numbers we hope to roll! Each of us has our own style...some more animated than others. My son has come to learn that if he wants Mom to play a game with him, he can always count on me to play Yahtzee. I guess I love the game because it was a game that I had when I was young and played with my siblings. What a classic game 
The tray is beyond pathetic. Do not buy this. It's criminal that is proudly labelled as DELUXE. A waste of money. An embarrassment. A cheat 
This is a great value and we have enjoyed many hours entertainment from this simple FUN game 
This game is loads of fun. I got it for my eighth birthday. I thought to myself "Oh, it's one of those stupid board games again," but it wasn't. I'm 10 now, and I'm still playing with Yahtzee. I like it because of how much thinking is involved, and you have to make impartant decisions, like "Hmm...should I put my score in 4 of a kind, or in my fours up top?" That skill can also help you along the way in school. But you know what, most games that are educational can be boring. But not Yahtzee! Yahtzee is also fun because of the excitement in you while hoping to get a Yahtzee, which is worth fifty points, which is the most points you can get. And you always feel happy when you roll something that you know is good! Now, I don't have the Deluxe Edidtion of Yahtzee, but I'm sure that if I liked the regular Yahtzee, the Delexe Edition would be even better. I hope you order this game soon. And for those of you out there who don't want to buy Yahtzee, because you think you are too cool or too old for it, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING!! 
I don't think this toy could have been made any cheaper. Ours is cracked in several places, even though it's hardly been played with... My kids really are not hard on toys, and are destroying this one. We also had bought the drumset from Little Tikes, but returned it, because it broke before I could even assemble it. Disappointing. This keyboard just doesn't live up to my expectations from Little Tikes products 
Agree with all other reviews. Kid enjoys the keyboard but also gets frustrated when the glued together mic stand breaks again and again...the mic itself only works intermittently...this also causes frustration. This would get a 1 star but because she enjoys it for the brief moments that it works and before the mic stand collapses, I am generously giving 2 stars 
This toy would be great if it would stay together and not fall apart everytime my kids play with it. We have two of these!! The microphones broke within a month of getting them. I would NOT recommend buying this toy 
THIS WAS GIVEN TO MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER BY HER SISTER FOR CHRISTMAS. THE MICROPHONE BROKE PUTTING IT TOGETHER. I COULDN'T FIND RECIEPT SO CUSTOMER SERVICE MADE ME PAY 5.00 TO SEND A NEW ONE WHICH TOOK ABOUT 8 WEEKS!! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT THROUGH LITTLE TIKES WHICH EXPLAINS THE POOR SERVICE WE GOT, NOT TO MENTION THAT THE CUSTOMER SERV. REP. ACCUSSED ME OF HAVING IT FOR MONTHS AND JUST WANTING TO GET A NEW MICROPHONE. THE STAND IS USELESS IF YOU MOVE IT THE BOTTOM COMES APART OVER AND OVER AND OVER!!!HOWEVER, MY LITTLE GIRL DOES LOVE THE KEYBOARD WITH ALL THE DIFFERRENT MELODIES AND THE FLASHING LIGHTS ETC.. SHE LOVES SINGING AND I LIKE THAT IT MAKES HER HAPPY UNTIL THE BASE COMES APART AT THE BOTTOM. IT HAS A CARRY HANDLE (TO BE USED WITH OUT BASE) BUT IT IS A BIT BULKY FOR LITTLE HANDS TO CARRY AROUND. I SAY THE COMPANY NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE STAND/BASE ON THIS PRODUCT. 
The 3" 5 pack blades are good, but I especially want to praise the Bic Supply people for such prompt service. The 8030 pack was delivered in a rain storm 
I find this set to be perfect for what we need. Even purchase the extra chairs. At first it was used for coloring. Now that my oldest son is into Thomas the Tank, it serves as a train table. He just started getting into Thomas and he is not interested in making the trains run the whole track yet. Which is good because a whole track set up does not fit on this table. I love that it folds up for easy storage. Yes the chairs are a little hard to fold, but I like that. I can look away for 2 seconds and I can find my 2 boys standing on them, or using them as ladders. I find the table and chairs to be stable. 
This was well made for the price and works well for temporary use, particularly since it folds and stores nicely under a bed if necessary. My granddaughter happily played and ate at the table and was able to entertain a playmate with the extra chair. Just a note, does require some assembly 
I bought this table and chairs for my 2 year old and he loves it. easy to put together and not wobbly at all, the chairs do fold up kinda hard. the chairs are sturdy and don't tip. nice smooth table top great for drawing and coloring on. very happy with this, well worth the money 
We were so blessed to find this set at Target this past weekend (7/29/06) on clearance for $14.99! So if anyone reads this soon, go check out your local Target toy department end caps. So easy to put together, colorful and lots of room. My son is 22 months and already loves this table. It's only been 3 days, but as of now, we do not find the table wobbly at all. Hubby used a drill to get the screws in nice and tight. My 7 yr. old sat in the chairs and she is 60 pounds. Of course she did this when we weren't looking and immediatly got out of them when we saw her. My point is, even with her in the chair, we didn't see a problem. So all in all, we are extremely pleased with this set so far. For $14.99 I can't complain! 
I bought this for my son for his first birthday. I wanted a place for him to "practice" sitting in a chair at a table. He's a little young to sit there for very long, but he will sit and eat a small snack (I stay right next to him as he hasn't mastered the dismount yet!). This set is nice for a younger child - many of the other sets looked bigger and better suited for 3 years +. When he's not sitting in the chairs, he likes to throw and push them all over the room. They are very sturdy and are holding up well to his abuse. I also like that everything folds up for easy storage 
I purchased this camera for my two grandchildren. I was truly disappointed in the product, and I think the kids were too; as they showed no real interest in using it or playing with and that was immediate. 
The Holiday Barbie 2006 African-American doll is beautiful. I'm glad that I kept searching and found the best buy on Amazon. She was in mint condition. I will buy from here again 
We have been collecting the Holiday Barbies for about the last 7 or 8 years and this year's African American Holiday Barbie is the best looking of any that have been made since we started collecting 
The stores were all sold out for the Christmas Season, so I tried Amazon. When we received the Barbie my daughter couldn't wait to open it and when she did she thought it was beautiful. She loves it. 
This doll is absolutely stunning. I have 17 years (1990 - 2006) of the African American Holiday Barbies, and this one is the nicest one since the 1999 Millenium one. Thanks to Bob Mackie for using his unique skills to create such a beautiful doll 
Bob Mackie has created an elegant doll for the holidays. Her hair is long and full, yet braided to keep it neat. The dress is velveteen with braid trim. Several years ago there was another Mackie doll wearing a similar fashion -- that fashion has been with my little friend for over four years and she still loves playing with it -- not a tear or a broken seam in it. Mackie is known for the beautiful mouth and the face mold he designed -- and this beauty takes full advantage of his creative designs. Great for collectors or for play 
I really like it, but it's a little too easy for adults. Not as fast-paced as they say, as well. But, it's still fun to play! Cards are cool to look at, but a bit too slippery. Somewhat hard to shuffle and control. Overall though, a nice card game. 
Very fun and easy to learn. Not as fast-paced as they say. We enjoyed the action cards which can change the course of the game 
Smart guide fourth grade is fun I learn spelling rules and parts of speech and the reading comrehension was tough for me the first time and knowing who what where when and why and underling the keywords is very helpful for me and I just learn to double digit mutiplication comparig fractions decimals and geometry it was a little hard the first time about triangles angels perimeter and area and it took me a while to know congrunent and not congruent and now i know them and I learn a few facts about the animals guess who game was east and the beat the clock game was a little hard but its going to take me a while and the circulatory and respitoy systems I always like to learn about the parts of the heart and it was very easy and learn parts of the respitory system Graphy data is pretty hard for but im getting there and getting to know your government is kind of easy and fun cause you get to know the laws that we have bill of rights declaration of independence and the three branches and it help me alot and the united states is fun too and the glossary is hard sometimes and this is going to help me get smarter everyda 
I searched for a really long time the other night to see if the Quantum books work on the Leap Pad and Pro systems. I never found the answer. I almost ordered the Quantum for my 9-year-old granddaughter but decided to wait. In a discount store I saw the books, and it clearly states on the book that it will work in all Leap Pad systems except My First Leap Pad. What a relief. Saved me $40 
I recently bought this book for my younger sister. She has been struggling in school and these books have been a great help. She loves them so much that our family uses them as an incentive to do better in school. The Smart Guide to Fourth Grade is probably the best book I have seen so far. She had so much fun playing the games like Spelling Stingers that she didn't even realize she was learning. What really amazed me is that after just half an hour with the book my sister was doing fractions! Her teacher hasn't even touched on fractions yet. I know fractions are usually one of the hardest things for children to grasp but she understood it in just a few minutes! The only reason I didn't give the book a five in durability is that the little cartridges that come with the book get lost so easily! I wish leap pad would come out with a storage system for the books and cartridges 
The I-Dog is a great mp3 player acessory. Don't get it if you want to store music. It doesn't do that, but it is a great little companion that lights up, and plays your mp3 player music. I own one, and it's soo cute 
the little boys love this toy. They all want to be sanitation workers once they get playing with it 
a nice sturdy truck. I expected it to be cheap for $[...]. I was wrong. it comes with 2 trash bins too. there are 3 buttons on the tide that made noise. my little guys are going to love this.. 
Love it!!! The food is actually the consistancy of real baby food. When it is time for a diaper change, it really looks like baby poop. Great. Nice price tag as well 
My daughter is really in to Bob the Builder right now and was thrilled to get this toy. It is much smaller than I thought it would be and doesn't really "do much". After the first few days of playing with it, my daughter lost interest (but thats what kids tend to do anyway). I think it is a fun addition to Bob the Builder products, it's just not as great as I expected it to be 
Dizzy is a really cool toy. Her cement "dumps" out, but stays attached (no small part worry). Front "head" bends so she can stand like in show when saying "brilliant". Her front wheels move slightly like in the show. Rear magnet is used a lot as Lofty lifts Dizzy out of cement (like in one of the books). Has held up in 2 months of bathtub and hard play. These take alongs are so much better than the talkies and just the right size for children 
Guillotine is great family game, although some parents may find the premise a bit gruesome for young kids. The characters (from the French Revolution) on the cards are all drawn tastefully, and other than the premise that they are all waiting in line to be beheaded, there is no overt blood or gore invovled. I noticed that the recommended age is 12 and up, but my 8 year old has no trouble understanding the fairly simple rules and strategy to play this game. Another advantage of this game is the short playing time. For two people a game takes about 10-15 mintues, and gets about 5 minutes longer for each additional player 
Guillotine is a fun, fairly quick game that involves about equal parts strategy and luck. You are competing with the other executioners to collect the most nobles' heads. 12 nobles (of varying points) are dealt out in line for the guillotine. When your turn comes, you must take who is at the front of the line, but you can use action cards to shuffle the line in many different ways. This one always makes my list of games to play 
I can recommend all of the Little Tikes "Rugged Rigz" vehicles. They are large, sturdy and work well. The Little Tikes bulldozer is one of the best, though, and is my son's favorite. It is a tracked bulldozer/loader, with a blade that raises and lowers (the blade locks at three different levels and "flips up" to unload sand/toys that it has scooped up). The tractor makes a series of diesel engine/backing sounds when your child pushes a large red button on the top. These sounds will continue intermittently as long as the child pushes the toy around, but unlike some toys, the sound does not start until they press the button. Your little construction engineer will love this toy 
My daughter says it is "water-y, squishy... like clay mixed with sand but it is definitely sand, difficult to describe". My son says it is "squishy, clay-ish sand kind of concrete that you can bend." Overpriced? Maybe a bit. Still, I've only seen something similar in a museum once. It molds well and looks really neat with beads, gems, etc. It really doesn't dry out but it has enough moisture to mold and hold. I think the person who wrote the bad review might have gotten a defective batch because that doesn't sound like this product at all 
I bought this also along with kit 2 and kit 3.. while they do move a bit quickly, these books, kits, are suppose to help give the child an idea of what "they" are and how the sound. These books and kits are MEANT to be used with a REAL person, and to reinforce what they are being taught, they are NOT meant to teach the child every thing there is to learn! A teacher or parent should be teaching these things in full to begin with and the books and kits to be used as a tool, or as a back up to help the child as a reniforcement. If you use them correctly they are a wonderful tool for any child! Ho and if you buy one kit you really should buy all three of them because the three together are a wonderfull addition to school work, practice, learing, reniforcement of what is being taught. Sarah 
I bought this for my 17 month old son because he loves water and things that spin. I looked at a few sand and water tables settled on this one because of the spinning accessories (they all seemed pretty similar otherwise) Comprably, the price was pretty good, too. I must say, we are really pleased with this purchase. Not only does my son LOVE it, but I found it very well made. Its really easy to put together (no tools needed!) but still nice sturdy. It's also lightweight and easy to store. The entire table breaks down for compact storage. The table has two deep sections (so far we've used both for water- maybe we'll do sand in the future) Its a nice height for toddlers, and it comes with some really cute accessories. The scoops are perfect for little hands and the accesories are sturdy, too. They have withstood some abuse from my son. It has a sectional lid, so you could have one side covered while leaving the other open, or cover both. The lid fits nicely and has a little road design on top, so when not used for messy stuff, it could also serve as a play surface. Overall, I'm very pleased. I think its well worth the price. Its not cheap, for sure (considering its just molded plastic) but I learned pretty quickly that kids stuff is just expensive- even the junk- so I guess my expectations were low ;) . We try not to overindulge our son with 'stuff', but felt a toy like this would serve a multi-educational purpose, so we splurged. Pleased to say we weren't disappointed. 
I am a Montessori toddler teacher and I put this in my classroom. The children just LOVE it! It is deep enough for splash control and it includes the water wheels which is great for cause and effect. I also love how easy it is to drain the water-easy for adults...too difficult for children. I recommend this to anyone 
Based on previous reviews written by other people, and by the screenshot of this product (and also on the rediculous price), I bought this thinking I was going to get something of a replica. I was wrong. This product is the biggest waste of my money I have had in a long time. First of all, the one I recieved had a very rough texture to the card table part of it, not smoothe like I was expecting. Second, the Spell card zones are rediculous, the cards fly out the back of it with a simple flick of your wrist. Thirdly, the place it takes on your arm is horrible. On the show, the disks clearly attached to the duelist's forearm close to the elbow, leaving plenty of room for hand movement. These attach literally on your wrist and actually require you to hold the disk with one hand, making it very annoying to hold, let alone look at your hand. The best feature on it is the Life point counter, and even that isn't that great. It's easier for me to callate the math in my head than it is to change the numbers to mark life point damage, a couple of calculators work much better than this pathetic system. All in all, this is definately not worth the money. Buy something else 
hi i dont have that grait acadimy duel disk but by looking at it i think it the best duel disk ever maid i hope that the graivyard is bigger than the old duel disks and i hope that it open to the duel mode by pressing a boton and i put i four star because i dont have the duel disk and i hope that my review helps every colector of yu-gi-oh thanks for everything 
I dont have right this duel disk but the chaos duel disk and i can only say that it works fine. I also think is good than the graveyard is bigger than in the two other duel disks so you not was needed to open the graveyard. i give it only 4 and not 5 stars becuase i dont have it myself so i can bee totaly sure than its so good like mine. I think its a fair price and its a very great gift for all Yu-Gi-Oh collectors. Hope my review helps 
This guitar is a toy and not a real guitar. It is the perfect size for my 2 y/o rock star. The sounds effects can be annoying and tape over the speaker helps keep it lower. You can take the batteries out so it just strums like a guitar without all the sound effects. This is a good TOY guitar and I recommend it for a young age group. My 2 y/o loves this. He walks around with it all day long. 
My 3 year old spent a total of 7 minutes playing with this book before she asked to put a different book into her Leap Pad. When I encourage her to use Pooh again, she absolutely refuses. She loves her Pooh characters and loves her Leap Pad. But this book? It's never been touched again. It seems to simple, and 3 year olds need a challenge 
We bought this book for our daughter because she loves all the characters associated with Winnie the Pooh. We quickly discovered what others have noted, namely, it is rather slow-paced when compared to My First LeapPad's other books. The songs are slower, as is the story, and the activities are much more laid-back. So while it doesn't hold our daughter's attention for long at normal times, we found it good for slowing down the pace on rainy days or just before bedtime. Which she has not learned as much from this book as from the others, the slower pace seems to have a calming effect on her, which as any parent of a four year-old will attest, can be a blessing 
I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECIEVED THE ITEM IN THE MAIL. IT WAS NOT ADVERTISED ANYWHERE ON THE PAGE THAT YOU HAD TO OWN A LEAPFROG SYSTEM IN ORDER TO USE IT. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A BOOK AND TAPE, AND I BOUGHT TWO 
Different kind of entertainment for a child. Good for a long car ride. Lots of PVd's to choose from or create you own 
I did pay a lot of money (more than purchase price) to have this item expedited. It didn't show up in time. However, the company made good by returning a few of the shipping dollars, and the product is what it is, without the "themes" you have to purchase in stores. The experience -- other than the delay -- was fine 
My grandchildren loved the Basic Lego set and are enjoying it. However, because it was purchased through a vendor that uses Amazon, I was not entitled to the free shipping. I thought this was unfair 
This is a good set to expand an existing collection. We added the house builder's set and the large building mat, which worked out well. I do miss the old, old days when Lego sets were not all theme-related. A good basic set 
We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. She loves Polly Pockets. I liked it because it came with a guy and animals. It even has little seatbelts. The top comes off and you can rock the animals. The doors click shut. You have to make sure the seatbelt is out of the way or it won't click. It is a great Polly Pocket addition to our collection 
Being a huge coffee fan - I think this is just adorable! 
Our daughter bought this coffee maker. We had trouble with it from the start. It leaked water from the base and made a huge mess wherever we put it. She was so disappointed, and so were we. 
This is a great game! It is a lot of fun, and not just trivia like Trivial Pursuit. There are word puzzles, analogies, and wild cards that could be about anything - 3 questions where you have to fill in two of the blanks, guessing someone's name, etc. It really is a great game, though probably better suited for an older age bracket, as we tried to play with an 11-year old, and there were just some words and musical groups she didn't (and couldn't possibly be expected) to know. 
Got the game for Christmas and played it thoughout the holiday. Good mix of questions. The only problem was we played it so much that we went through all of the questions and then it was more of a memory game. Also a good game to play in teams 
Wit's end is a very fun game. I recommend it to anyone who wants to challenge their knowledge. If you don't know much you will by the time you finish the game. If you don't reach your Wit's End before you finish that is 
The thing I like about this game is that it is a trivia game that everyone can play. My hubbie hates Trivial Pursuit, but likes Wit's End, because, since a lot of it is multiple choice, you have a chance of getting the answer even if you just guess 
I played this game one on one with another person and we had a fairly good time. Even though we could not answer over half the questions, they were multiple choice and we learned a lot. But once we took the game to a party with about 6 players, the game lost its luster. Not only did we all not know the answers to most of the questions, we weren't guessing correctly either. Couple that with the fact it seemed forever before it was your turn again, the game was a flop. Maybe if we played in teams it would have been better, but it just didn't work out for a group 
I have collected all the Trivia games out there. And boy am I happy I have added Wit's End to my collection. It's smart, it's fun, it's entertaining and oh, did I say it was smart, because it is! This is the best type of game to take out at parties. The game generates conversations and exercises some mental stimulation. I had to give it my thumbs up in public....it deserves the press! Don't be without this one in social gatherings 
What can I say. This is a fantastic game. You know when you keep seeing movies and are often disappointed and keep waiting for the blockbuster. Well, WIT'S END is the blockbuster. I can't tell you how much fun we had playing this game. It is a trivia and knowledge based game but with a twist. Not only are you challenged by the questions, but the question types make the game even more interesting. There are four different card categories which ask different types of questions. The TEASER category, asks you to figure out the relationship; the SEQUENCE category asks you to put people, places and things in sequence; the ODD-1-OUT category asks you to decide which thing does not belong and the WILD CARD category has many different types of fun question types. As if the great categories where not enough, the questions cover a great range of knowledge; including pop culture, music, literature, geography, history; science....just everything! Better yet, there are detailed answers to every question. So you are not just left with a one world answer, but an explanation. You actually learn a thing or two of interesting facts and details. The questions are smart (real smart!), not the dumbdown version in other Trivia games. I cannot stress to you how fantastic this game is....that is if you are up for the challenge 
After reading all the glowing reviews, I was really excited about this game. I was very disappointed when I finally got the game and actually played it with my family, however. There are four categories of question, but these categories differ in how the question is asked, not the subject of the question. It's a nice idea, and with different subject matter might make the game interesting. The majority of the questions seem to involve history or dates in one way or another, however. If the question is about music or film, for example, it might involve placing placing releases in order from oldest to most recent. Current events questions might require the player to know which event occurred before a certain date. As someone who's more interested in the why and what than the when, I found myself bored and frustrated by this game. I like to learn something even when I get the question wrong, but I found myself not caring much about the right answer to a question if all it involved was knowing which obscure play was written before WWII, etc. Conclusion: if you're good at history and dates, you'll probably enjoy this game. Otherwise you'll probably be bored and anxious for the game to end. 
This is the first review I have taken the time to write on Amazon. This toy is as bad as others have said. So much is wrong with the design - but the worst thing is that the reflective panels do not stay in place- I wanted to think that they MUST lock in place somehow. Has Rainbow Art tested this product? I was hoping to read some Amazon reviews of Digidraw to find out if anyone had a remedy for the panels slipping- The remedy is to return the toy. I will quickly say that the reflected image is a blurry shadow - my boy's can do better freehand. Please don't waste your money! 
This "art tool" is basically two plastic panels that POORLY reflect an image on paper. There is nothing to this toy. Looks like the manufacturer spent a lot of effort on packaging and marketing and put NO effort into the product. Also, the name "digi" is hysterical, there is nothing digital about the product - the 2 plastic panels are inside a case that resemble a laptop. LOL! Big waste of money! You get better results tracing images the good old fashioned way when using parchment or tracing paper 
How can anyone be 'extremly dissapointed' with somthing like this? Despite this products said flaws, what is it that you people expect? I dont think that any of your children will be perminantly scared or anything of the sort. People, please. 
I bought this along with the regular Digi Draw I wasted my money. It is hard to see image to trace. Maker's of this product should have put more effort into making this. Big disappointment 
This tracing type art toy is nearly impossible to use. The reflective panels do not securely attach and if you just brush them with your arm they fall down. There is no integrated light with the toy so you need to find a very well lit space to work.  My 5 year old and I were extremely frustrated with this toy and will be returning it 
My son wanted a wagon for Christmas to transport his matchbox cars around. This was perfect. It's not very big, but for the price, it's a great value. My son loves it 
My cousin, my uncle, my aunt and I were tossing this football around and it hit the ground so many times without getting even one scratch eventually of course it did get some scratches but it is a far improvement from the vortex of old that would hit the ground a few times and fall apart, so I would reccommned this to anyone, you would be suprised how much fun the vortex football will bring you, if you are considering getting one of these, I would say go for it 
I just got this figure in the mail and I have to say that it is really nice looking. I have it up on my mantle now and it looks a=even better out of it's packaging. It is a must have for Kings, Gretzky, and NHL fans. Id rate the pose a 10 out of 10, it was from when he got the points record in Edmonton. This figure would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the assembly. You have to put Wayne's legs on and normally the leg assembly is easy but thios was just horrific. It is possible, but I had to use tons of soap and water just to get the legs in, and then it wasn't easy. But I think that it is definately worth it. 
I got this cottage for my 14 month old daughter and she LOVES it. We keep it in the house and our daughter is in it every chance she gets. She likes to sit on the pre-made chairs and eats snacks on the little table, she also loves to talk on the included telephone which is too cute!!! For the price, this house is a great buy and she will be able to use if for a few more years. I was a little nervous about buying something so large on-line because I was afraid it would arrive broken but it arrived fast and in perfect condition and the free shipping from Amazon is such a great deal!!! The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the flooring inside has deep grooves and if your little one is bare footed and playing in it for long periods, it can be painful on the feet. I resolved this issue by going to the home store and buying a small grey bathroom rug to match and pad the flooring. Now its more than perfect and we LOVE it!!! 
My children are enjoying the new cottage they received from SANTA. It's the perfect size for them. And it was a very reasonable price for the product. I think they will definately enjoy the cottage once it goes outside. 
I love this little cottage. We got it for my 18 month old and she enjoys it everyday!! I love that it is more open than other pretend houses, so there is plenty of air circulation in our hot humid weather while she is playing. The construction is very durable, and there is enough space for her and a friend, or doll to play! Definitely don't think twice. And the free shipping is a bargain on this! 
My kids; 4 and 1, love this playhouse and use it several times a week. There are a couple things I don't particularly love about it: it's not as tall as I think it should be and the sink/chairs are pretty much a waste of time. Some more useful toys inside would have been better, but overall it's been a great thing for them to play with. 
We bought this house for my daughter for her 1st Birthday, we must have looked at about 15 different houses, this one stood out because it had a little table and built in chairs, opening shutters, a mail slot, and a working door and doorbell (although the doorbell did not work when we installed it and had to have the manufacturer replace it, which they were happy to do). Another bonus is the built in floor, so that if you choose to keep it outdoors (we haven't) little feet are not sitting in the dirt. She loves to play in this house it keeps her busy opening and closing the door and pushing 'mail' through the slot. She especially loves the table and chairs. I like that it's open and I can see what she's doing and she likes that she can be seen 'playing house'. 
My husband, son, and I saw this playhouse in Wal-mart yesterday. I let my 13 month old son play in it and I had to drag him out kicking and screaming when it was time to leave. We would have purchased the playhouse there but the display was all they had left and the phone was missing, the sink wasn't attached, and all of the stickers were gone. So, when we got home, I called every Wal-mart store with in a 100 mile radius of my house. Finally, after an hour or so on the phone, I found one about 30 miles away. We got there thinking that we would have to pay the full price of $139. When we went to check out, it rang up at $100. They said that it was on clearance because it was out of season. We were so happy! My husband just put it together tonight and it only took him 15 minutes. My son was so happy. I recommend this to everyone. Even at full price, it is well worth it. My son loves the phone and the windows that open and shut. I love the flooring. It keeps the dirt and bugs out. I am a little worried about him leaning on the door and falling out but I watch him closely to prevent any accidents. Anyway, your kid will love it too, I'm sure = 
We just gave this playhouse to our daughter for her second birthday, and she absolutely loves it. If she spots it out the window she starts crying to go out and play with it, even when it is bedtime. I love how I can watch her playing from afar, because of how the sides are open, but she still has two windows she can open and close. I also love how it has a solid floor. Other playhouses I've seen, without floors, end up with dead grass and mud in them. The house is roomy enough inside that I can join her in there, and she loves the phone. Even though she has a few different play phones to play with, I think she likes this one best because it is most realistic. The doorbell sounds so realistic, too. I researched a lot of different playhouses, in different price ranges, and I feel you truly get the most for your money with this house. I'm not giving 5 stars because it wasn't completely easy for my husband to assemble. He said there were some parts where the instructions said to drill straight, but really he had to drill at an angle to make it secure. Also, there were some defective assembly parts, like a screw with a flat, instead of a pointed, tip. The house itself is somewhat flimsy. When my daughter leans onto the table it does bend down some. But, so far it is holding up, and at this price I really can't complain. Just a warning to other parents... when we tried buying this house in stores in early July it was already deemed "out of season", and we were left to either buy it online (and pay nearly $100 for shipping), or travel an hour away to where we did find one in a store. I learned my lesson to always buy outdoor toys in the spring or early summer. 
My toddler loves this toy. The only drawback is the design of the door. It is easy for your toddler to fall out fast as they try to push the door open. 
My baby loves it, he is amazed looking the birds and lights move. Great quality. I didn't have any problem with it, works fine. The music is also great 
Bought one because I liked the idea of the light show in ceiling. First one stopped turning the first night and the lullaby music button didn't work like others have wrote. Returned it for another same thing!!! I will have to say I like the idea but this is by far the most disappointing mobile we have bought 
I bought this mobile when our last one wore out. Our son does like to watch this one go and loves the music, but the quality is so poor, I can't give this any higher rating. I had to return the first one we bought because the lullaby button did not work; both that mobile and this one buzz as they turn, as another reviewer commented; and the mobile goes through batteries like crazy, as another reviewer also remarked. I hadn't had this mobile 2 weeks before it needed its first change of batteries--and I had started it with 4 brand new Duracell C-sized batteries. Already, I have begun to have problems with the buttons on this mobile, which I haven't had for a month. And I have to agree with the comment that it is rather large and ugly. On the whole, I expected better from Fisher Price. Since I haven't had this a month yet, I am thinking of returning this model to the store and getting a Baby Einstein model instead. I have a friend who has that and his 5 month old loves it. Like this model, it can be changed so that children can use it themselves once they're too old for the mobile-only function 
I have always loved Fisher Price items so when I looked for a mobile, they were the first ones I looked at. I have been pleased overall with the mobile. Amazon was great at shipping fast and ordering was very easy. Overall, I have been very pleased and will order from Amazon again 
I would like to ask others who have purchased this mobile if they hear a "buzzing" sound as the mobile rotates. It seems loud to me and I'm wondering if this is normal or if I purchased a defective one. Also, I feel the music is too loud even at the lower volume selection. I even covered the speaker to muffle it as it's primary purpose is to put the baby to sleep not keep him/her awake. 
We haven't had this mobile for long but I think it's great. I love the fact that we can use longer than regular mobiles. The projection is great not too bright or too soft. The lullabies and the classical music is nice. You can the mobile going without any music. After the baby outgrows the mobile you can use as music box and still have the soft toys and projection attached to it. I've had this mobile less than a week; I am keeping the box just in case anything happens, but so far everything is great and my little guy loves to look at it and my 2 year old loves the projection light and music. It takes 4 C batteries. 
I bought this for my daughter when she was 9 months old. She absolutely loves it. She has played with it every day since I bought it two months ago. The self-storage for the balls is great. The only complaint I have is that there's no way a small child can push the ball past the button on the top to get it to spiral down. She puts the ball in the top and wants me to push it through for her. That was fine the first thousand times, but it would be nice if she could do it herself 
I have to admit, I wasn't sure my daughter would enjoy this toy when she received it from a family member. But, she has liked it ever since the beginning, and still enjoys playing with it. But, I think there's a design flaw. The balls are too hard for small children to push into the toy. I've had to help her until just recently (she's now 18 months) - she would get frustrated otherwise. This toy does have a lot of cute buttons, but my daughter enjoys the balls mostly. It lights up and plays lots of music, so it's definitely entertaining for kids 
I got this for my little girl on her second Christmas. She played with it Christmas day and once in her room. The balls are hard for her to put in the hole at the top. She just started placing them on the slide (not through the top). She never used the panio keys and could not turn the wheel. Not much fun 
When my son received this for a Christmas gift we actually did not open it right away. We though he (16 mo at the time) would grow out of it too soon and thought we would return it for something that would last longer. After he was always going to the box we gave in. This has been one of the most popular toys in our house - especially when friends and my nephew (5!!) come over! It's taken several dives off the coffee table and shows no damage. It is a very entertaining toy for my son. My only issue is that I don't like the voice for some of the rhymes - but obviously that's personal! I definitely recommend this toy for 12 mo and up 
My eight-month-old received more toys than she could ever possibly play with for Christmas, but this one is by far and away her favorite. She LOVES it!!! She cannot play with it enough. It is adorable and so clever--so many features. Only drawback is that it is difficult to push the balls in through the top--takes more strength than a baby has. However, she still can have a great time with it and has spent countless happy hours. I recommend it highly 
my 5 year old and 19 month old love this toy. it has cute music and learning stuff on it, very colorful. it is worth it 
When my daughter opened this on her 1st birthday my immediate thought was - Oh, another keyboard (She got 4 this year). This is one cute toy. It has so many functions that I am sure she will use more and more of as she gets older. It does have a keyboard but also plays individual songs, is a ball drop and teaches cause and effect. Its bright colored and lights up and isnt tooo loud. One HUGE point with me is, it comes with 4 balls. AND its built to STORE the balls when not in use. She has a FisherPrice ball drop toy that the balls are all over our house because there is nowhere to store them. Now granted, my daughter hasnt had this very long so we have not had time to get sick of the main song but so far she really loves it and is exploring all of the different things it does. I believe this toy has staying power. I just wish it was a little sturdier. She tries to pull up on it to put the balls in the top and it topples right over 
My mother recently went birthday shopping for my 1 year old son and she came home with the Dr. Dreadful Food Lab as a small gift for me. I was suprised given the fact that i'm in my mid 20's and haven't played with toys since i was 11. Fact of the matter is this kit was a blast from the past and i can only hope that there are toys like this available for my son when he gets old enough 
My 6 year old son got this as a gift for Christmas and immediately wanted to make the "food". All the recipes for the gummies are basically the same, you just change the flavor to suit your taste. We never did find a flavor or combination flavor that he liked, and ended up throwing out all of the treats he made. The drinks were equally as bad tasting. There were no directions as to how to set up your "lab", just a lot of connector pieces that didn't seem to fit everywhere you wanted them to. As other reviewers stated, you need to have an adult there to help with the mixing. He grew bored with the kit, put it away, and has not asked to play with it again. 
My 6 yr old son got this as a Christmas present. It is disgusting!! The stuff is sticky and oozes out when it is setting. It isn't very tasty either. My son liked the gummies but there was some kind of drink that we poured down the drain. I have put it up and am hoping that he forgets that we have it!! The recipes are not hard to follow but pouring them into the molds and getting everything set up requires an adult. 
ok games like these , are so much more fun than the games they have today when i had this i didnt know i was learning i totally recomend this 
Words cannot describe the awsomeness of the Dr. Dreadful Food Lab 
We thought it was a lot of set up. The lab did not seem stable. My 9 year old could not snap the mold covers on and the molds did not fill up all the way with the mix, which left him with 1/2 of a gummy worm. It was messy, awkward and not worth the money we paid for it. It is in the trash. We wouldn't buy another one. Also the piece that is used for the mixing - what an odd design. And I could barely pull it apart to clean it to make another batch. Save your money and buy the supplies to make the goodies in a bowl at home 
The kids had fun with this, but the goo is very hard for young kids to mix without making a mess. It starts to set very quickly so its hard to get enough out of the bowl and into the molds. It was okay, but definately not worth $25. My 6 year old has just as much fun playing with cheap spices and a bowl of water 
I have four children between the ages of 4-10 and we have bought many "make your own food" kits. This one has been the best by far. The directions are really easy. My six and eight year olds needed a little guidance, but my ten year old was fine doing these by herself. The projects are all done very quickly (3-5 minutes at the most), and ready to eat right away. Even the gummy-type creatures only have to cool for five minutes. We have a candy-making kit from National Geographic and there is not one project in there that can be eaten in less than an hour and a half. A real bummer for kids! Dr. Dreadful is also nice because nearly everything you need is in this kit. The only thing you'll need to provide is water. It even comes with its own measuring spoon! Some of the other kits require you to provide lots of extra ingredients and household items (sugar, salt, string, waxed paper, etc.) There are enough ingredients in this kit to make dozens of projects. There are a lot of parts to this kit, so make sure all the pieces are cleaned up. We lost one little plastic disk (I found it on the floor and had no idea what it was so I threw it away) and now we can't make the gummy creatures very easily. The Dr.D "experiments" are all pretty tasty, especially for kids. This toy has been a really big hit at our house. 
i got this toy for my cousin who is 6. he Loves it. of course i had to help him with it, reading the experiments and all but that was ok. it is pretty messy and sticky so having an adult around helps. he didnt like the taste of some of the experiments so we ended up just throwing them away. i also didnt really understand the whole thing about connecting the lab together and stuff. luckily he didnt care about setting it up as he did just making the food. overall it was not a bad toy. just a few hitches 
McFarlane Toys is only up to Series 3 in the Cooperstown Collection of 6-inch action figures of some of baseball's greatest stars of yesterday, and Nolan Ryan is already up to his second edition. His first figure was part of Series 1, and showed him in the home uniform of the Texas Rangers, his left knee up in his chest as he got ready to throw a pitch (presumably a fastball in the high 90s). This figure shows the all-time strikeout king in the road uniform of the California Angels, following through on a pitch (presumably a fastball in the low 100s). So between the two figures you would have the long (or tall) and the short of Nolan Ryan. Ryan was traded to the Angels from the New York Mets for Jim Fregosi and pitched for eight seasons in California, from 1972 to 1979. However, this figure would have to represent Ryan from 1975 or later because that is when the Angels started wearing the red cleats you see on this figure. Too bad, because his best seasons with the Angels were 1973, when he went 21-16 with a single-season record 383 strikeouts and a 2.87 ERA, and 1974, when he was 22-16, 367 strikeouts and a 2.89 ERA. He threw first two no-hitters in 1973 and his third in 1974, and those were also the only two seasons Ryan won over 20 games, which is amazing when you consider he ends up with over 300 wins. Of course, that becomes easier to do when you pitch 27 seasons and all I have to say is that whoever taught young pitchers in the Mets farm system how to strengthen their legs to prolong their career did a fantastic job with Ryan (27 seasons to age 46), Tom Seaver (22 seasons to age 41) and Jerry Koosman (19 seasons to age 42). Seaver or somebody must have passed this information along to Roger Clemens. The only reason Ryan retired was because at the age of 46 he had his first season in ten years when he did not average over a strikeout an inning. The sculpt of Ryan's face is pretty good and as always the attention to details on the uniform are great. The figure has limited articulation, but basically you want it to look like what you see here. For me the key detail is how relaxed Ryan's right hand looks now that he has released the ball, like he had just whipped the ball by somebody for one of his 5,714 strikeouts. He threw seven no-hitters (this could not be from his 1974 no-hitter because he pitched that at home against the Baltimore Orioles and not on the road), and another 12 one-hitters. What new record about the Ryan Express did I learn today? He is the only pitcher to strike out the side on nine pitches in both Leagues, not that this surprises anyone. But you look at his record and you wonder what he would have done if he had played for better teams, because he had a career ERA of 3.19 to go along with all those strikeouts. Nolan Ryan is to the last quarter of the 20th century what Walter Johnson was to the first quarter: a great pitcher despite being on teams that were not great. That is why he is popular enough to already be on his second Cooperstown Collection figure. 
This battery is a JOKE!!! You charge it for four hours and you are lucky if you can get 5 minutes of flight time before the battery dies. A disgrace, as is the junky plane made of styrofoam. You pay $100 for a toy, it would be nice if it flew for more than five minutes and didn't break into pieces on every landing 
please this battery doesn't work at all, less than 5 minutes and let me tell you if the battery gets discharged in the middle of a lake you will need a real boat to get your storm launcher back, i wouldn't mind to pay a few plus dollars just to have more time to enjoy my storm launcher. 
I've played the game maybe five times. The same questions came up at least three out of those five. In short, no fun. It's also not like the game we see on TV. SO not worth the cost. Whoever created it should be ashamed. 
Awful game. Nothing like the show. The only way we could try to make it work was to have both teams answer each round and just see who scored the most points. They must pay people to write some of those 5 star reviews. I doubt my family will ever play this game again. Boring 
We've had fun playing this DVD Family Feud Game as a family, it's much like the television version, a good variety of questions, including a thorough "how to play" selection to check out if your a first time user, just select that icon by using your own DVD remote, and within seconds, you're playing. The genre of questions remains the same as what you'd see on the television version of the game, some get a little "racey" like "What would you bring along on a first date?" One answer was "a condom..." Negatives - Some answers I considered way off, like "what's a complaint people have with a valet service?" All the answers revolved around being too expensive, or the driver drove too fast, took too long. I thought of answers like, "he adjusted my seat, changed the radio presetting stations, moved the side mirrors, stole a CD..." So, some of the answers were unreasonable. Another question asked, "what's an appliance you might ask help moving," the number 1 answer was a sofa, but washer/dryer wasn't even listed. That didn't make sence to me. Also the speed round, I was dissappointed when the speed round came around and only the top rated answer to each question is revealed worth points. In the television version, more than one answer is valuated by points. Positives - The on screen "how to play" icon will thoroughly walk you through the object of the game, it's simple and to the point. The game is fast paced, completely self explanatory, very compact, would be great to go on vacations with, takes no set up time, easy learning curve, the game prompts you what to do when. The bright and colorful display with attractive on screen game menus makes it fun to play with "elevator music" timing your responses. Conclusion - It's a really fun game to play if you have at least 5 minutes to sit with your family and play a game. It's a go anywhere, creative, thought provoking game that everyone will enjoy contributing to 
This is one of the best DVD games there is! i totally reccomend this game for everyone, including kids. Kids and adults will have bunches of fun playing the game, but to have even more fun, just make a deal with the other team and say "Best two out of three games is the champion!!" because this Family Feud game is very short but fun. One of the lamest questions they asked team B was: "What famous man has sideburns?" and our family was puzzled. Of course, who could of thought of Abraham Lincoln??!! But although it is short it is one of the COOLEST games out there!! Trust me, it's an addictive game! Pretty soon at your party and the next day someone will say, "Hey, guys, wanna play Family Feud again?" Have fun and be sure to buy this!!!!!!!!!It's a great dvd game!!!!!! AND it works on my laptop!!!!!! 
I am sure this must be a good program, however, I was disappointed to find that it was not a PC program rather one for the TV. I am hoping I can trade it for the PC program since my granddaughter and I like to play Family Feud when she visits. We have an older version but we wanted an updated version 
Has catagory in first 10 minutes of play that answers are sleazy dancer, stripper and prostitute. Not appropriate for Kids who want to know what those are!!!!! 
My boys love to go "WEEEEEEEEEE". They are very creative and could find a slide out of anything...they were using my hubby's sit up bench. We bought this slide for them and they LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it. It keeps them entertained and they actually share and wait their turn. It's folds easily for storage and can be used indoors or out. A MUST!!! 
I purchased this slide for my 15 month old. She loves it and did from the moment she climbed on. However, it is much smaller than it appears. It is maybe three and a half feet tall. My daughter figured out how to climb the steps in the first 5 minutes and within minutes after that she was climbing up 2 steps at a time. (that's how small it is). On the plus side, it is also easy to fold and store because of it's small size. As much as she loves it now, I am scared she will outgrow it in a couple of months. Regardless, I am happy to have it since she's happy to have it 
Ok, the picture makes the slide look bigger than you think. It's very small,and shaped fuunny, so the bottom of the slide kinda fold under, it's hard to describe, but it makes the trying to slide process hard. My daughter was as long as the slide. She started jumping off the top of the slide, and had her fun there, but no sliding down for her. This is definitely for a 1 year old, no older. My daughter was 2 at the time I got it. I went out and bought the bigger one. Now she loves that. That one get an a 
This is my first purchase of any outdoor play equipment and i am very pleased with it. i bought it for my 22 month old and was a little nervous at first about her falling off of the top. i watch her very closely but she seems to have mastered it. i like the high hand rails at the top opposed to others i looked at because it helps alot with them to hold onto while sitting down. the steps also seem to be at more of an angle opposed to other slides. my 22 month old has not been off it since and it is also great for my 4 year old. i don't have a yard, so this was a perfect toy for my children to have a little fun with limited space. i would definitely recommend this product! it is alot of fun and with it being made by step 2 we all know it will last a long time 
No children... bought this mobile for my office, I'm setting my sights on the final frontier. A better mobile might exist, but I never found it. The mobile consists of cardstock photos from NASA; I would not say it is durable, but it hangs from the ceiling so that should not be a deterent... as children should probably not be hanging from the ceiling anyway. It's easy to put together if you have two sets of hands and hangs beautifully once in place. Unlike a lot of the other mobiles I saw, this one has a sun... nice touch. I would highly recommend this product. The world needs more mobiles 
I love Scattergories, so I wanted to try Slapagories. It takes some getting used to, but it's fun. You just have to get used to slapping and yelling (not at people of course). It's definitely a fun change to the original Scattergories, but I prefer that one over this one 
The instructions were a little difficult to follow. I put together our son's crib, so it's not like I'm instructionally challenged. ;-) Once it was put together, it seemed very sturdy, but was still pretty easy to move around. I liked that you had to tilt it because this way, my 2 year old can't push the whole thing around his room. I also liked that the bottoms came out of the storage bins so that when you move, etc., you can fold the boxes completely flat. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it isn't bigger. We've got two young children and it seems like no toy box is big enough 
This organizer looks great, and I spent some serious money on it, but in the end it was disasterous. I use the wonderful laundry hamper part, but once you put anything in the bins they automatically fall down because there is nothing securing them in. This product is a total let down 
If there was an option to pick "no stars" for this item I would! This has got to be the worst organizer made. On top of serving no purpose, Toys R Us AND the manufacturer are not willing to work with me in exchanging it for something functional! The bins sit on 2 wooden poles per rack. There is no center support in each rack therefore when you load the bins; they fall down onto the rack below and so on. It is very frustrating and it only sits in my son's room to collect dust until I throw it out this weekend! I highly recommend avoiding this organizer and manufacturer! What a waste of money and energy! 
Since my husband would not let me get a real play kitchen... I saw this and snapped it up! To my surpise, my 3 year old that normally hates touching play-doh, was all for this! We made lots of different foods with the molds and even wanted to sleep with the fake egg (not happening!) Oh coarse the biggest down side to this is that it IS play-doh... it makes such a mess and I am always vacuuming, but it is worth him being really happy to play with something besides Thomas the Tank Engine 
I got this for my 3 year old nephew at Christmas time and he still plays with this for hours. This is the one creative toy for a kid that will keep them entertained for a long time 
I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter who loves playdoh and she loved it ...but the stand that connects to the oven always falls off so we just turn it upside down and play with it that way because there are cool shapes on the underside you can smash playdoh into. overall it is a good playdoh toy for playdoh lovers. 
I gave this Play-Doh set to my son today for his 4th birthday and he loves it! He spent close to 5 hours straight "cooking" and "making dinner" for my husband and I. It is a great toy and I highly recommend it for kids who like to spend time creating different "meals" and putting them together themselves. I think that it teaches to clean up when done or the play-doh dries out, to wash the dishes and it's just a lot of fun 
I recently purchased the password journal for my 10 year old girl. She loved it!! It has so many things you can do to it. She really loved the stamps! She also really enjoyed that you can create your own cover to make it different then others. I would definately recommend this to anyone with girls between 7 and 11!! 
My friend has this, and she loves it! I really want it!!! She says that it is really fun, and her two sisters and three brothers can't get in it! This is a really cool jornal and it lasts a long time! Get it for your daughters 
My girls are having a blast making up new passwords, and the big brother is having fun trying to figure it out every time it changes. The only recommendation is to be very patient and speak clearly. Any background noise or change in inflection, stops the journal from opening. But if you remember that it is is toy, you'll have a good time 
This was the main thing my daughter wanted for xmas. Three months later I finally gathered everything up in a grocery bag and took it back to the store because it had just sat collecting dust. Main reason being we couldn't get it open. It took 2 days to set the date. Then I figured since I could do that it would be ok to close it until we could work with it some more. We tried and tried to use the password but no luck. Honestly I think they need to take the thing off the market. It's a nice concept. I ended up getting her the barbie dairy instead. Much less stress and much cheaper. I know there are plenty of people out there that agree with me I only wish I would have listened to you before I bought it. 
My 8 year old daughter wanted this more than anything for her birthday and it was absolutely everything she was hoping for. She loves being able to change the password any time she wants and gets a huge kick out of thinking that she's the only one that can get into it! (it does seem to be little-sister-proof) It even tells her how many "intruders" tried to open the journal. The pen with radio gets a few stations depending on where she's walking in the house - only downside to the radio is that I can't hear what she's listening to unless I'm always checking on her. Shredder on pen is manual and is for tiny pieces of paper only - which seems to be perfect for whatever shredding an 8 year old girl can want to do. There is a way to set the journal to be easier to get into - the more sensitive setting really is very sensitive - we had to reset the password several times when it wouldn't recognize her password - but problem resolved when set to less sensitive. (and easier for Mom to get into without setting off the intruder alert.... 
Bought as a gift, they loved it; was cheaper than buying in a store 
My son helped me put this together after its arrival. That, in itself, was a treat. The pieces are kid friendly, not sharp, and the item is exceptionally sturdy for a cloth lined toy box. Shipped for free only makes it better 
I have a PhD in Polymer Science and I can easily tell you that this item is extremely overpriced. Only sides and the top is plastic, rest is canvas type of material. I can not see how they demand such a price for this toy box. Only thing I liked about is the colors. 
We were looking for a larger toy box to hide the toys in our Great Room. This box is lightweight, durable, and great looking. The top does not hinge like a door, but it does open and close as if it has a hinge because of the plastic configuration. I would recommend this to any parent.... the storage pockets in the front are great too. My wife and I are very happy with this purchase 
This is a great toybox and safe for the kids. The only thing about it is that I wish the top attached to the body so it wouldn't come off everytime I open it 
This toy box hold alot of toys and is very accessible for my child to get in and get what toy he wants out. The pockets on the front are wonderful for holding stuffed animals or smaller books. The lid is cushioned so its soft in case it falls shut, fingers won't get hurt. I would recommend this toy box to everyone 
I bought this toy box for my granddaughter. I like the idea that her parents can put her favorite things in the front pouches without her having to lift the lid. I am also impressed that the lid can be removed so there is no danger of little fingers being caught 
I got this toy box for my nephew who just turned 12 months old in November. He has really enjoyed it! My sister now has a place that she can put him and his toys and not worry about his safety 
My only complaint with this toybox is that the lid doesn't stay attached. We simplified things by removing the lid and just piling the toys to overflowing. It's an otherwise sturdy box that can withstand a mountain of toys and a 34 lb toddler all at once 
I unfortunately lost the Racko Card Game I had long ago. I was so glad to see it was still available to buy through Amazon. It is a great game for children to play as well as for adults. I notice the game now has more variations to it which is delightful 
I used to play this when I was growing up. I love this game and now that I have kids its even better. WHY? I helps them learn advanced number skills by putting number in order from 1-60. They have to choose to use a card that is showing or draw and take a chance. Makes them plan ahead and adjust on the fly. A great game of chance and skill, my 6 year old loves it, and he can win too 
I was satisfied with my purchase from Amazon.com, especially since I could not find the game from any other source. The item was a gift to my Granddaughter who wanted the game. I have no personal experience with the game 
I first saw this game while volunteering in my daughter's second-grade class, where the teacher used it in one of the math activity centers. Being able to put numbers in sequential order is a critical skill, and this is such a fun way to teach it. After looking for the game everywhere, I finally saw this one (a reissue, I think, since it's kind of retro) and grabbed it. And although the box says 8-and-up, my 6-year-old son can play just fine. Sometimes we simplify the rules a little, and ignore the special green cards, which direct you to switch cards, trade with opponents, etc. Overall, a very fun, educational game! Highly recommended. :- 
LOVE THIS GAME BUT MUST SAY THE OLD VERSION WAS BETTER. THIS ONE DOES HAVE SOME FUNKY SPECIAL CARDS WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF PLAY -- JUST PREFER THE OLD FASHION WAY OF PLAYING. BUT STILL A GOOD GAME 
If you want a great simple to learn game for the entire family this is it. We play it as a family and sometimes my daughter and I play while we are making supper. It is really a fun game 
I thought this would be just like the original Rack-O. The cards are hard to read and have too much on them that is not needed for playing the original game. I just needed new cards, since my son and I wore out the first pack (from the original game). I'm sorry I bought this 
What a fun and exciting card game this is! Takes both strategy and luck to emerge the winner. Can be played for years without boredom. I liked it when I was a child, and I still like it now 
This is a family favorite. My family and now their families have been playing for about 20 years. The only problem I have had is that we play the game so often, the cards become bent and sticky from all the shuffling and handling required. I wish it were possible to get just replacement cards instead of the whole set as I now have about 16 racks and only enough cards for 4 players. This game teaches young children 6 and older how to arrange their numbers in order. You don't have to be a genius to play and the whole family can get involved. Young children love it because they can be included in the games. Very inexpensive also 
I bought this used at a baby consignment shop so it gets a thumbs up for durability. Our baby LOVES the whistle- and from time to time it gets taken out of the bathtub to be played with and then we need to track it down before bath. We are happy with this toy 
I bought this for my son when he was 2. He has always loved taking baths until recently. I thought this toy seemed interesting enough for him to want to play with in the tub. After reading other reviews I was sure this was the toy...boy was I wrong. He has absolutely no interest in this toy whatsoever. He won't even play with the whistle. He would rather play with plastic cups. I would say this might possibly interest a younger child 
Just got word that this gift was an instant success with my nieces. Although, keep in mind that this is not a toy for infants. 1 year and older is the norm 
This bath tub toy has been a great hit for my 2 nephews ages 4 1/2 and 1 1/2. It's the only toy they play with now at bath time. They take it all apart and divide up the pieces so they each have something to play with. It was one of our Christmas gifts to them, and best of all.... it doesn't make noise like most of the other hi-tech toys they have! They have to use their imagination with this one, and have learned sharing 
My son who just turned two would stay in the tub for hours to play with toy. He loves to take it apart, play with the individual pieces and put it back together again. He identifies the colors and counts. He has to carry at least one of the animals out of the tube with him. It is easy to clean and retains no water. Overall an ideal bath to 
My 2 year old son loves toys that he can put things in and out. He also loves water, and since he got this toy he has lost interest in attempting to dump water OUT of the tub! All my kids love this and it keeps them busy 
I agree that this toy is great for imaginative play. I purchased this for my 2 year boy/girl twins and they love it! I like the fact that it is brightly colored, simple in design, and has many uses! My kids learned to blow the whistle, dunk the bears, and delight in me filling up the bottom of the boat and sprinkling water over them in the tub! When you have a bath every day, you need toys that are interesting! I also like that it stores well. A great buy 
I was very pleased to be able to fing this car for my grandson. His was lost and we weren't able to find him one locally 
Nearly every one of these individual characters, is claimed to be "hard to find". Spend some time looking, you may be surprised how much you'll save. These character cars are collected by both kids who play with them, adults who soley collect leave in the original packaging. It doesn't matter which type of collector it is, a 20 + dollar car is outrageous !! I got my "Chick' off E-bay and I hit the auction just right got mine for a reasonable price. I know, it gets tiring running around looking for something, but if you hang in there - you can save.......... 
I agree that the prices are a bit ridiculous for the cars toys, however, you may have to pay a bit more for some of the characters if you want to complete the collection while the toys are still hot items. My son LOVES his Chick car----Chick provides lots of action to the story. I'm just glad I was able to find this car on [...], because I haven't seen it recently in any of the stores in my area. And, sure I could've waited to find it cheaper---but by the time it shows up in our stores, My two year old may not be as interested in playing with it. He now has all the main characters and he can play with his Cars collection for HOURS 
Keep looking! If you want it bad enough just keep checking the stores. One place I would have never thought of looking was Younkers. I went in there mid-January and they were fully stocked even with the hard to find woody and buzz, hamm, etc...They were higher than walmart, but a lot less than this 
i've found all of the cars by going to every toys r us, walmart, walgreens, kb toys i was near (NC, NY, NV) however i still have not seen chicks or the king 
Chick Hicks is one of the hardest cars to find but keep trying. My nephew wanted this car for Christmas. My sister had everyone she knew looking for this car for 3 weeks. We finally found it at Toy R Us for $3.49 a week after Christmas. We had managed to find all the other cars before this one. Don't pay this price for it. Now that Christmas is over there will be a lot more of these around 
We have a few of the Shake Go Racers. My kids love all of them, but the Hot Rod is the most fun. The other cars we have just stop when they hit a wall, but the Hot Rod bounces back and continues to zoom on in another direction. I don't know if it's because of the body style or if it's more powerful than the others we have, which are a little older. You can't go wrong with any of these cars though, and I'm sure we'll be adding to our collection as time goes on 
Purchased for our 3 year old Grandson for Christmas with the race set as well. Has turned out to be one of his (and the family's) favorite things. Lot's of fun and even easy for the little ones to use 
These cars are so much fun! Just as the name says, you just shake it up and it goes. My son has several of these and they all have slightly different reactions. Some are faster than others. They work best on a hard surface - Cement, hardwood floors, tile. They go pretty slow on carpet. The cars are very durable. One of my son's favorite games is to launch them off the deck and see if he can get it to land on the grass below. If the weather isn't nice, he likes to send them racing down the stairs. So far, nothing has broken and its been over six months. These cars are easy for my daughter (who is only two) to play with too. The kids love shaking with the cars and racing to see who's car goes the farthest. 
My two boys love this car. They received it for Christmas last year, along with the Shake 'n Go Race track. I'm buying them the other cars that they did not receive last year this year for Christmas. Great toy it keeps my 2 boys occupied for hrs 
My 3 year old son and his 5 year old sister both love this car! They aim it at their cardboard blocks and have a demolition derby. Highly recommend it 
Just bought this for my son, it arrived in the mail today and from the second my 20 month old even saw it in it's package I was racing to get it out of it's box because he was so excited - really cool looking car! Then all you do is follow the name...Shake Go and the car is off racing. My son was just amazed that all he had to do was shake it and off it went...He loves chasing it as well as me shaking it and sending it in his direction so that he can catch it and send it back to me. The sounds are also fun and the styling couldn't be better - love the price too! I'm definitely buying more 
My 19 mo. old absolutely LOVES cars. It's his favorite word too. This has been so much fun teaching him to shake and let go. It also gets him to sit still for a minute while it goes. He loves to chase it or just sit and watch to see how far it will go. We can't wait for Christmas to get more. It's fun for the whole family 
These cars are really fun, because there's more to do than just push a button to make them go. The kids just love shaking them up and chasing after them. The more they shake them up the farther they go. It's cool that each car makes a different engine noise too. I definitely recommend to get more than one, as it is really fun to race them! 
My 2-year-old, car-obsessed kiddo loooves this car...and it's started more than one heated debate with his 2-year-old buddy down the street. It's very cute and the noise isn't too loud or annoying. Just a good basic car which a young kid can operate and enjoy. I think it's a great gift idea for a vehicle loving kid. 
My two year old is a new fan of Dora, so I bought her the beach set in this series as a stocking stuffer. To say she loved it would be an understatement. So I bought her this 'on the go' set to get the Tico character, and I thought she would like the car. We have many Dora toys now, but the little Dora and Tico figurines in this set are very loved. What's nicest about them is that they are small enough for her to hold in one hand, and so are very portable. They are also hard molded plastic, so while they aren't poseable, they also aren't breakable. She can bring them in the bathtub, to bed, play with them at meals and in the sandbox. The paint has held up well to wear. The car's wheels do not turn, but it's compartments are very easy for a small child to put Dora and Tico in and out of them an push them around without it being difficult to maneuver. My one complaint about this set as opposed to the beach set is that Tico's nose is very pointy and actually rather sharp. I think the recommended age for this toy is slightly older than my daugheter actually is though 
I ordered the Little Tikes Crocodile Piano for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday. When it arrived and I opened the box, I had to literally pry it out of the hands of my husband, who was having a ball playing with it. It was a big hit at the birthday party and well liked by the kids. I would recommend this toy--kids are sure to enjoy it 
I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old nephew. It is adorable and has multiple sounds, including instruments and other sounds. It is a great size, not too big (it can be set on a table or lap) and not too small (it can also be used directly off the floor)! He loves it and "plays" for me every time I visit 
We got this for our daughter when she was about 21 months and she didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it then. But now a year later this is the first toy she plays with each morning. She can play her own tune, or set it to play a variety of well known tunes that she can dance to. Our baby loves playing with this also, and became interested in it as soon as she was able to sit up. I highly recommend this toy, especially for the price! 
Hi, I don't say ToysRus is not a big firm, but if you buy thru amazon, be prepared to wait. I've been waiting for 35 days. Christmas has passed, new years has passed, still another 10-15 days for estimated delivery. So be aware. 
My son enjoyed this toy while it was working but it didn't last very long! After about six months it just quit working! Of course I thought it just needed new batteries but that didn't do the trick 
My son is 18 months old and loves the piano. He will sit in front of it for hours (something another toy has yet to do). Even his older brothers (8 yr old twins and 14 yr old) play with it to show him how what to do. The demo mode is the best...He will press it and just dance and laugh. So far it is holding up to the banging and constant playing. We love it! 
My [...] loves puzzle. and flipping the pages. Very sturdy peices, even though they have gone in her mouth a few times, I still love this puzzle book and am very suprised at the negative comments. If your child likes puzzles and flipping pages this is for you 
I bought this book as a sanity-saver to take on my recent 4-hour plane ride with my then 19 month old son. It served its purpose and then some. He still loves this book, over a month later. I was surprised to read other comments about losing the pieces and having to play "supervised" with this book, as I have had no problem with this at all. Sometimes we read the book together, and sometimes he "reads" it himself. He hasn't lost a piece, yet and this book has been on many excursions with us, including the one mentioned above, where we took it across the country. (including connecting flights) My only complaint is that the pictures aren't so great. In fact, it is very difficult to discern the animal in the "M" picture for monkey... even for me. But they're not all bad. It was still a great choice for us 
We have had this magnetic ABC book for a year now. We take it out to look at together every few weeks or so. The pieces are all intact and the book is fairly entertaining. My 2-year-old likes to take all of the pieces out, one by one, and then he will name the pictures as he puts them back in the correct positions. In my opinion, the illustrations are just OK, but then, that's not really the point of this product. My 2-year-old book fanatic will sit and "read" his books for 45 minutes at a time, several times a week. This is not one of his favorites, but every so often, he seems to enjoy it. It's something different anyway. I like the "hands-on" approach this book provides. This would make a great car or plane trip toy, provided that you bring a carry case for all of the pieces. This is quiet, educational, somewhat engaging and requires no batteries 
This wonderful little book has magnets with pictures of things that start with each letter. My 2-year old has the magnets all over the fridge 
While we have several of these wooden puzzles, this appears to be the one they didn't think through. It's a wonderfully constructed book but easily dismantled. My 2 year old can remove all the magnetic pieces but rarely puts them back. And like another reviewer it must be used under complete supervision. Unlike the "noisy" puzzles that my son will not leave alone. They are wonderful toys but this one really should have some improvement to it since the age range is really wrong for it. I love it, don't get me wrong but it does need some re-thinking since it is a product that young children can take apart and with small pieces there is a choking hazard. Or at least a chance that they will get stuffed into little mouths unless properly supervised 
My daughter loves this book so much. It is made so much better than a lot of wooden toys that fall apart at the edges. I do recomend that your child be over their "everything in the mouth" phase as the pictures on the pieces will wear off easily. Also, I wish this book had a simple latch to keep it shut without the pieces falling out 
NECA Toys did a very good job on this 18'' Freddy Krueger toy based on Freddy Vs. Jason. This is a musy have for all toy collectors and Freddy Krueger fans. It says 3 phases from Freddy Vs. Jason and 1 sound of his finger knives from the same film. It's definitley a figure for all fans of the series 
Yo... I just picked this up and it is really great. It is worth dollar it costs. The sound is amazing; every word he says is cool now GO BUY THIS! Don't just sit there on your ass and stare at the screen 
Bought 2 of these for my grandsons. They love them and play with them daily. But I saw the same item at walmart for 1/2 the price 
You can either get the cards alone, or buy them with that H2O appendange somewhere else on the site. They play just like any ol' deck of UNO cards except with a little new "downpour" rule, it's really fun. Since they're waterproof, they won't get stained, either. At first, they seem a little slippery to handle, but you get used to it. The downpour rule is a lot of fun to play around with, and these cards are great overall 
its good and you can play in the pool or tub and whan someone spills on them they don't get wreake 
We like to go camping. Card games are a hit when sitting at the picnic table with a lantern burning bright. No TV to distract us from family time. It's great. Then it's time to turn in for the night. Everyone sleepily goes off to their sleeping bag and in the morning we find that the cards were left on the table. Damp, stuck together, wrinkled, etc. You get the picture right? Well, that problem has been solved. At least with the UNO H2O cards. You can play them in the lake if you want!! They will not become wrinkly, or torn from trying to pry them apart. This game was worth spending a few dollars more on. We'll have them for a long time. Why aren't all cards made in plastic 
My 5-year-old granddaughter has a real problem with monsters. She's afraid of going to bed at night because there might be monsters somewhere in her room. Well, I got her this game so she could play it right before bedtime. It worked! She takes it to bed with her and if she starts feeling afraid she just pulls it out and plays by herself. Great game 
As a counselor for young children, I highly recommend this game. Very young kids learn social skills like taking turns and sharing. Many little kids have fears of monsters and this game really starts the conversation of how to handle the fears. The game also teaches assertiveness skills that can help with personal safety 
This is a cute, easy game to play with. I bought this one for my son a few years ago and it is still a big hit. It is fun and keeps him giggling. He asked to play a few times in a row, because it is a short adventure. I think if your little one is scared of monsters in his room this helps ease his fear. When they happen to pick a monster out of the sack ...they say~ go away monster and pitch it into the box...and I make up little things to say when this happens. I highly recommend this game, not hard and really you don't need directions...explain it once and they have it. Great buy 
Whether you're 2 or 92 -- you'll have fun playing this game! This is a wonderful family game to play with young children. I first purchased this game when my son was 2 (he's now 7). He still plays with it with his younger brothers. You can have up to four players play with his or her own playing board (which is designed to look like a child's bedroom). Players take turns reaching into a "monster bag" and feeling for pieces of furniture needed for their rooms. If you pull out a monster instead, you can hide it under your board shouting "Go away, monster!" If you get a duplicate piece of furniture, then you may pass it along to someone who doesn't have theirs yet. The first to complete their room with all their furniture wins 
I bought this game for my children for their birthday (ages 3 and 5) and they love it. They actually try to pull a monster out of the bag so we can all scream and make noise. Also the game is easy to put away. After a time or two of playing they are finished for a while, but pop it out a couple of days later and they are ready to go again.. 
I learned about it on reading many reviews at boardgamegeek.com, which is the best resource for reliable reviews of board games for kids as well as adults. Sure enough, my 2.5 year old son loves this game! I suggest hamming it up w/ much fear/consternation at the appearance of a monster. This adds to the mystery excitement upon drawing each piece from the bag 
We bought this game for our son for Christmas and he loves it. It has really taught him how to take turns and cooperate with his sister when playing a game. It is also a lot of fun for him. Our son is has mild autism and the visuals of this game make it easy for him to learn and follow 
This is a wonderful first game....Be sure to make lots of high affect funny faces and sound effests...oh no...I picked a monster! and then in an exaggerated way take the monster and throw it to the side of the room saying "go away monster!!!!!!" and laugh..and smile. Very good for speech delayed or autistic kids that really need to develop shared attention skills...fun!!! 
It is a great game to get a toddler started....you can make it as fun and funny as you want! There is no stress with complicated rules. A child learns to share, count, and recognize objects...without realizing it 
this bookcase looks great in our playroom and is the perfect height for our 2-year-old to put her things away. it hold more than it looks. great quality wood. i read reviews on assembly problems, and if i didn't screw up at step #3 i would've been fine. but i didn't realize i'd put a piece on backwards until i was at the end. had to do the whole thing again- what a backache! but it was worth it and we are really happy with it 
I also read the other reviews before buying...I'm glad that I did! I also had problems with the sides, but I realized that I didn't have the shelves on correctly. Incidentally, I purchased a second one at Toys R Us because I liked it so well. I would highly recommend this for anyone that needs nice looking, well made storage space. 
We love this for our 10 month old! She can pull the drawers open and get to her toys...I can put them away very easily and nothing ends up at the bottom of the "toy box" forgotten about! It just fits in to our family room as far as "furniture"...maybe not the designer piece but a great solution for toys and books and furry friends.  
I read these reviews online before I purchased this. I selected this bin toy organizer because the other ones I looked at had issues with safety and it was very important for me to know that this type of organizer was going to be safe. I really like the Mission Oak style of this organizer ... we put it in our living room and it looks nice (for having toys all in it). Better then the big plastic toy chest we used to have! The shelves and the bins are all easily accessible and my 19 month old DD loves to take things down from the shelf or carry the bin to her play area and dump it all out. At first I thought the bins were a bit too small to be practical, but now that she carries them around I actually appreciate the fact that they are smaller. They are easier for her to handle and it means that there is less she will be dumping out! After reading the reviews for this organizer, we made sure we read the directions carefully and it is important to get it right. Otherwise, my husband thought it was very easy to put together and he said it had a really nice design....much easier then most of her toys! Additionally, knowing that the hardware is hidden in the buckets was also helpful. I would definitely recommend this piece of furniture ... it will last a long time and get a lot of use 
We needed a storage system for our 2 year old. This is perfect as it's just his height, and it has great storage for both toys and books. I'm glad I read the reviews first thought. I knew right away to look for the hardware in one of the bins (although I can't imagine why customer service doesn't know to tell you to look there and instead sends more) Also, the first time we tried putting it together, I couldn't get the sides to fit. We would get one screwed in, but the other side would then the other side would be off. We were really trying to force it, and finally gave up after 30 min. I then read a review about one of the sides (C) always faces you and since other people put it together so easily, I thought I did something wrong. We took then whole thing apart and CAREFULLY followed the directions, making sure we matched the peices according to the picture given. This time everything came together nicely and we were done in 15 min. So other than installation (which is easy if you REALLY FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY) this is a great product 
Very nice looking, solid, holds quite a bit of stuff. I love the plastic storage containers. We bought ours from our local toysRus. My husband put it together by himself with no problems, in only 15 minutes. ~Ki 
We were looking and looking for a storage solution that wouldnt make our living room look more like a play room. It's very sturdy and is the perfect height for our 2 year old. Daddy put it together while our daughter napped, very simple and is a beautiful piece. We found this modeled in Toy R Us, so we knew what the finished results were. No problems with any defects or missing hardware 
I purchased this product from Target and found the price to be the cheapest. It took me over 3 hours to put it together. First, I had to find the screws (HIDDEN IN THE PLASTIC DRAWS). I was able to put together the bottom pieces inside frame, I had to worst time putting the side panels. They did not match with the holes and when getting them in the inside frame came out. I was able to get it, with a lot of moving the wood. The other side panel was IMPOSSIBLE to line up with the dowels. I had to have my husband move the wood, while I placed the screws. Finally, when everything was done and filled with my daughter's toys and books, it looks great in her bedroom. MAKE SURE TO HAVE THE A/C ON, WHEN PUTTING TOGETHER. YOU WILL SWEAT A WHOLE LOT WITH GETTING THE SIDES UP. 
Before you call Little Tikes to order your missing hardware (it arrives in about 1 week), pull apart the trays to make sure its not hidden there. Since installing the trays is the last assembly step, we just set the stack aside and never thought about it again. Otherwise, assembly took about 1 hour and was not difficult 
Over the years, I have managed to amass a collection of pretty much every version of "Password" ever produced. With the exception of "Super Password," I enjoyed every televised version of the show. The "Password" episode of "The Odd Couple" is one of my all time TV favorites. You may have guessed, I like the game. This DVD version is, for all intent and purpose, just an over-produced variation on the standard home version. Instead of the cards and holders, you get a pair of 3-D looking glasses. Unfortunately, you can easily read the secret password on the screen without the glasses. And, the computer generated host (Charmin' Chuck Harmin) is just about as annoying a host as they could come up with. Endless Games has produced many good home games. DVD games, at least going by this one, do not fit into their business model quite as well. Save yourself some money and get their standard edition "Password" game. It's not as high-tech. But it's a lot more fun 
This is the only rocking horse that I could find that a smaller child could ride on. It keeps my son busy for what seems like hours and he just loves the sounds. He giggles every time that the horse neighs. It is so great that there is one at the grandparents house too 
We purchased this item for our 9 month old for Christmas and she absolutely adores it! The sounds add real value and encourages your baby to want to bounce and rock along...We highly recommend it 
Very much like the previous reviewer, my son was one when he received this car. He didn't quite understand the keys/tools at the time, but he is slowly learning the concept as he reaches two years of age. For the amount of pushing and crashing my son has done to this car, my husband and I are extremely surprised at how this toy has kept up. This is a great toy and we highly recommend it. 
My son received this car for his first birthday. At that time he did not have the fine motor skills needed to use the keys etc to fix the car, but he loves to push it on the floor and watch it go and crash when it bumped into things. It kept him busy in the kitchen in the evenings while I cooked. Now that it is coming closer to the two year mile marker, he is learning to use the keys to refuel the engine and fix the problems on the car when it breaks down. It is just challenging enough to him to be fun, and it also dishes out rewards when he gets it right. This toy is very durable and the planning that went into it is fantastic. It has just enough sounds to keep him entertained but not be annoying! A+ at our house 
Great for horse lovers, both those with a lot of knowledge and those wishing to learn. Has provided hours of fun for two of my grandchildren. I have enjoyed sharing the fun with them. Of course, this is easy to play as most people already know how to play monopoly. Just gives a new, fresh perspective. Great addition to the family game collection 
This was a Christmas gift for a friend's grand daughter. We could not find it in the stores here, so was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It was exactly what we wanted and arrived just as we would have bought it from a local store 
Very good pictures of horses, excellent graphics, as good or better than the game it is derived from. It plays just like Monopoly. A great game to learn about horses and money management! 
WE BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE LOVES IT. SHE LOVES HORSES AND ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM, SO THIS BOARDGAME WAS THE PERFECT GIFT. WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IS BUSY, SHE EVEN PLAYS IT BY HERSELF!! 
"It is awesome", says my grandaughter,age 12, whom I purchased this for.The directions were easy to understand, and holds her interst. It is like Monopoly, except with horses! She says "It is the best thing for any horse lover". 
This was the hit of Christmas for our great niece, 9 years old. The whole family played for hours and had a great time. It's perfect for the horse lover, don't hesitate to get this. 
Our granddaughters and their little friends enjoy playing this new interpretation of the old classic Monopoly. They both love horses and competition, so the game was an excellent choice 
This game looks like tons of fun for my horsey daughter and granddaughters.. the only issue I have with the game and it's not the maker of the game or the game itself's fault.. is, I got this for my daughter for Christmas and the day after it's delivered.. she calls all excited that she found the "cutest game" for her barrel racing daughters.. Horseopoly! yay!!! The kids love it by the way : 
My 7 year old granddaughter loves this game. Her mom rides horses so she is around the stables a great deal. They have been traveling a lot across the country and take the game with them on their travels. Really happy to see the moving pieces are back in metal form. A fun game that the whole family is enjoying 
My baby girl absolutely loved this toy! We gave it to her when she was 4 1/2 months old and she immediately figured out the spinner and pull-hammer. My only complaint would be that now she is too old for the beginner side but gets frustrated with the advanced side. But the on/off switch is a BIG plus in the age of all toys having lights and sounds and it hooks onto the siderail of the crib or sits on her legs very easily 
I bought this toy originally to put in my daughter's pack n play, but realized that I can also use it in her play yard hanging on the side. it is also great to use as a free standing toy and has two sides for multiple uses. Overall, I love it and so does she. 
This toy was one of my daughters favorites as a baby, and now our newest daughter (4 months) loves it too. It grows with your child, keeping them entertained. It can hang on the crib, or be placed on the ground. Very good 
We've received this toy as a gift from our friends and i liked the idea of 2 sides (is like having 2 new toys at once). But then, when we tried playing with it i didn't like several things: 1) side 1 - has a really hard to squeak thing, - hard to pull hammer - pretty far located smiley face so the baby playing with it as an activity table (not crib mounted) won't easily reach and press it - smiley face could have more than 1 melody playing It results in that side having only 3 things to play for the baby at 6-8 months: spinning flower, spinning ball and a mirror 2) side 2 - the most i don't like in this toy (both sides) is the music of those 4 musical instruments buttons. It sounds not like it's a baby toy but like it's some kind of tool to horrify the baby. We have pretty much musical toys and none of them has the music which is soooo unpleasant. My baby just looks at tose buttons as she looks at strangers she doesn't like. - pop-up thing - could have a better holding door (opens easily) and prettier "animal" inside. - the squeaky knob on this side is hard to push even for me. To summarize i'll just say that as for me even 2 sides are not worth the money! I don't like it at all 
We received this toy from my son's grandmother when he was three months old and he seemed very interested in it even though some of the functions were out of his reach or a little too hard for him to use. I was a little worried about the strap design from the beginning but thought I was just being overly anxious. Wrong. Several times I noticed the straps slipping. I figured it was just because I had them in the lowest notch so I moved them up one. He could only reach the very bottom toys that way but he still enjoyed it. This seemed to help for awhile but then he realized there were other things on the back of the toy and got curious and started pulling the toy out toward him. This was okay until he lifted up on it at the same time. It came right off the straps and hit him in the head. Thank goodness it hit the mattress first and then fell over on him so that it was an indirect hit because this toy is HEAVY. It weighs close to 3 pounds with the batteries in it and is hard plastic and that is quite a lot to fall on baby's head. I have emailed Tiny Love regarding the problem but also wanted to let other parents know that this is a good floor toy but don't rely on the hanging straps 
There is some great activities on this toy, but there were problems on both sides. On the first side, the only way to get the face to light up and play music is to press hard, and hold the face for a second--what infant does that? Also the squeaky thing is hard for even me to press. My 8 month old liked the spinning flower though, if it is the only toy around. On the older side there are much better activities. He is enjoying those more, but the pop-up feature won't work. It does not stay closed. If I do get it to close, just touch it and it pops up--you are supposed to learn to press the button. I found this toy in a local baby store after buying it, and 8 of 10 had the same problem. I haven't seen a better crib activity center, so we are still keeping it (mostly because I am not a returning type) 
My 6 month old LOVES this toy! We're only on side one, but it entertains her for a long time. Only down side is it doesn't lay straight on the side of the crib unless you take the feet off. But little bother for GREAT results! 
I would not recommend this toy. My 10 month old son was able to break off one of the 4 knobs on the bottom of the toy. I found the piece clenched in his hand while he was asleep, we are very fortunate he didn't put it in his mouth. These knobs when broken off are a choking hazard. 
Our 3 month old son loves this toy. He hits it real hard and looks at what he's done. It is a cause and effect toy. Would highly recommend it to others. It is lots of fun to play with it. 
My son got this as a gift when he was 4 mths. He had absolutely no interest in it whatsoever.I was a little upset since I thought it was a neat toy. Boy oh!boy...now that he is older (18 mths) he is in utmost love with this toy!!!! He loves the music...and all. Both sides fascinate him equally! I would not recommend this toy for kids younger than 9 mths because some buttons are quite hard to operate... a good toy overall 
This was the hit in my almost 3 year old son's Easter basket. He loved it and didn't even care to check out what else he got once he had this. He really is enjoying it and I have to admit, it really is cute 
We got a slightly different version of this flashlight maybe a year ago. The smoke on ours is smoother/less bumpy than the smoke on the one in the picture. My son LOVES this Thomas and pushes him around quite frequently. Unfortunately, he accidentally dropped Thomas a few months after getting him, and now the light doesn't work (the accompanying sound doesn't work either). The wheels still set off a sound effect, but we couldn't figure out how to fix the short even when we took Thomas apart. Still lots of fun, and maybe they've fixed that problem, but I did see that another reviewer mentioned the same thing happening 
I bought two of these flashlights for my two Thomas fans for Christmas. They are a HUGE success with the kids. I only give them four stars rather than five since the train sounds tend to drive me up the wall 
Bought this for two little two year old boys for Christmas. They loved them. Once they were opened they were not even interested in any other presents. Great that it comes with batteries included - ready to go right out of the package. Extremely easy to operate. Great toy for the price 
This Thomas flashlight is a HUGH hit with my favorite 2.5 yr old. He loves the chug chug sounds and the ease of use of the flashlight makes this the toy that sits on his bedside table EVERY night. Scarey dreams just disappear when Thomas lights up 
We purchased this for our 11 month old son. He is fascinated by the lights, sounds and loves to push it along as he crawls. It is durable and well made; I have little doubt he will get several more years of play out of this toy 
My 1 year old LOVES this toy. It's both a train (with very realistic train sounds - not annoying) and the perfect flashlight. Not too heavy. Light turns on and off when you squeeze the handle. It does not roll on its own though. Another good feature is there is no off switch, so the very young cannot be frustrated by a toy that "doesn't work" (is turned off) 
My son loves this toy so much! It is not only a flashlight, he can also push it along the ground and it makes sounds and toots. He loved it so much we got our nephew one 
This is a great game addition for any family interested in horse or their care. My daughter loves to play this game and also loves to just go through the trivia cards to see if she can answer them. It is a great buy 
One of my daughters received this as a gift and I couldn't wait to play it with her. There are four categories of questions: Breed, Riding, Horse Care, and Anatomy. As players move across the board, they choose a question from any category. As some of the reviewers said, some of the questions are extremely easy. However - some are very challenging. I say this as someone who has been riding for 35 yrs and who has owned horses. For example, one question is "Mares come into season: (a/ 21 days during spring and summer, b/21 days during fall and winter, c/41 days during summer and fall) (correct answer is "a"). An easier question: True/false: you must always wear a helmet with a chin strap when you are jumping a horse (true). There are 200 questions in all; I seriously doubt anyone would find it entirely too easy or entirely too hard - there are a good mix of difficulty levels 
My daughter is a horse fanatic! She loves to play it! I just hate being pulled in because I know nothing about horses 
I highly recommend this game to anyone who has a true interest in learning more about horses 
I havn't had that much of a chance to play this game but it is great. It is a trivia game for all horse lovers. you can play with up to four people. you have to answer enough questions of diffferent catagories such as care and riding to win 
I enjoy playing with this game very much, some of the answers to the questions are FUNNY!!! Navigate around a colorful game board with a miniature cardboard Breyer model, and answer questions along the way from four different categories. For every category you correctly answer a question for, you get one of the four pieces of a first place ribbon. The first player that collects the whole ribbon and gets back to the barn first is the winner!! I reccomend this game to any horse lover 
Any child who is into Naruto is going to love this item - parents may not understand it, but the kids do they have a blast using both the gloves their imaginations 
This Naruto rapid attack gloves were purchased for my 2 boys, ages 8 and 11. They both love anything to do with Naruto. They fit my 8 year old but my 11 year old couldnt get them on. His wrists are to big to fit into them. Otherwise, they are a great toy and they have had fun with them 
My 2-year-old daughter loves Dora and I wanted to get her a Dora doll for Christmas, but I didn't want yet another doll that talks or sings or needs batteries. This Dora doll fits the bill perfectly: she's soft and a good size for small hands, and she has nice yarn hair and a cute little backpack. No complications! My little girl loves her, and is playing with her as I type, as a matter of fact. 
After being commanded by my mother, my mother-in-law, my wife, and my daughter to get the best Dora doll there was available and to spare no expense, I went through a rigorous screening process and spent countless hours testing the various incarnations of Dora dolls for features such as safety, ease of washing, child appeal, actual resemblance to the cartoon character, ease of transportation, ease of identifying as the property of my daughter, etc. Underwriter laboratories is shamed by the rigor of my research. I'm an anal retentive statistics nerd. I scored 40 dimensions on a five point scale and optimized the model, and determined that this Dora doll and no other is the best Dora doll available. I did not test the metric "induces jealousy in other children" and "disrupts strangers and my own daily existence with constant interruptions from other parents and children who observe it and ask me where we got it" but if I did this would score a perfect five. So, this is a daughter, wife, mother, and mother in law pleaser of a Dora doll, but you will constantly be asked where you go it as your child carries it in public, especially in London, Paris, Geneva, Monaco, the Maldives, and St. Bart's. Please buy one and take a load off me 
Dora is a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves Dora, and I am so excited to have found a small stuffed Dora that she can carry with her 
My daughter received this doll for Christmas two years ago. She loved it and it is still her favorate doll to sleep with every night 
We LOVE our tea party game! The real fabric tablecloth is a nice touch, and is creased deeply enough to be folded the same way when it is returned to the box. The game pieces are sturdy enough for plenty of pretend play, and the box becomes a tea tray for the remaining teatime items. Each plate, cup, sandwich, fruit, and dessert looks different from one another, so instead of skipping a turn when a child already has an item they may to trade it for a like item just to keep things interesting. The game lasts just long enough to stay fun. An added bonus at our house is that it not only eschews licensed characters like Dora or Barbie-- it even has art by renowned children's book illustrator Lizzy Rockwell 
This tea party game was the favorite Christmas present this year. My daughter just turned 3 and loves this game. We can not go through a day without playing it several times. The table cloth is so cute and "girly". The pieces are very durable and well coated to avoid damage from a small spill. One time through the game, and my daughter had the rules down pat. (She still has some trouble with Chutes and Ladders and Candy Land etc., but picked this game up with no trouble at all.) Another great perk of the game is that my 3 year old can set the game up and pick it up all by herself! I would highly recommend this game for any young girl, especially if she is even slightly prissy. It is so cute, even I couldn't wait to play 
This prank gag is great to pull one over your friends. The only problem is, unless you or someone likes to get shocked, no one will actually pull it at all after their first experience. Unlike the Shock Pen, this gag shocks your whole forearm or as it seems 
this is NOT shuch a relisic looking prank so not to many people will realy fall for it.If you want a gooooood prank get the shocking pen expire edition!!! 
We have only had this for a few days. My six year old who has needed occupational therapy for fine motor skills and has been diaognosed as hyperactive loves it. I feel that it is good for building up the strength in his hands. I installed it in just a few minutes -- most of that time was spent looking for a limb of the right thickness and height in my yard. The first limb I selected was way too thick and put the Twizzler too high. Purchasers may want to take into account the thickness of the limbs they want to use as well as the height. Overall, this is a really a fun activity for my son 
My 5 year old loves this toy! It hangs from our tree and she gets it going in a circle and pulls up her feet and lets go! She goes round and round! My older 2 like it too, and all they have to do is throw it up and around the branch so it is closer to the branch, making it shorter for taller kids. When they are done, the unwrap it and it is ready for my 5 year old again 
My son received the smartville ice cream shop for his first bday. he played with it all the time. We bought him the rest of the set for christmas. This is definitely his favorite toy. He is 15 months now and he plays with this set almost all day long. This is one of the best things I could have bought for him. He understands how it works by placing the characters on the round spots. I feel it will be a great teaching tool for when he is ready to learn the alphabet and his numbers 
This toy seems okay, but my 13 month old son isn't that interested. The music and sounds are also somewhat annoying 
My husband and I purchased the voice changers to be Dick and Jane for Halloween. We had so much fun with them. We laughed and laughed at our voices. The only thing I would say is the headband portion is pretty thin, so be careful not to break it 
We bought this for our son for x-mas, he already has a voice changer that he plays with a lot, but it's one of those bull horn type things that you have to hold up, so we thought he'd like this. It only changes the voice in 2 ways and then it's a matter of turning the tone up and down. The headpiece for the microphone is designed to fit a very large adult and doesn't go down to a small enough size. The one we got I think was a returned item refurbished, because upon opening the seal of the item had chips in it (not the top or bottom) and the voume control just spun, which made it difficult to turn on. For a $16 dollar item, I'm not sure it's worth the return cost to return it and get a new one, it just isn't all that fun for a 6 year old, he prefers the old bull horn one we have 
its great because you can study it and figure out how it works, whose lightsaber it is from the movies (in this case its a Qui-Gon Jinn blue) and fight with it because its durable, all sorts of stuff!! i LOVE it! 
Toy Lightsaber Line (2005.) INTRODUCTION: Star Wars is the ultimate science fiction saga of all time - there's no debating it. Ever since 1977, the science fiction saga George Lucas created has captivated audiences all around the world. If there's one idea from the series that was truly unique, it was the Lightsaber - a beam of pure energy that could slice through anything - except for the blade of another Lightsaber. Many attempts have been made over the years to create the perfect replica of these legendary weapons, ranging from children's toys to high-quality replicas. One of the most abundant of the children's toys is the standard toy Lightsaber line. Read on to see how these non-powered replicas measure up. OVERVIEW: This line of toy Lightsabers was released around the same time as the Revenge Of The Sith film. They retail for approximately eight dollars each. Many different colors and styles are available, and more are likely to come. This is a line of children's toys, not high quality collectibles. REVIEW: As a big fan of Star Wars, I love to explore all different varieties of products from the series. Lightsabers are one of the coolest things to emerge from the Star Wars universe, and as such, it's one of the things toy companies have attempted on numerous occasions. These models won't really win any points for detail or flare (mostly due to a lack of light and sound) but for having your own little duels, these will work nicely. Keep reading for pros and cons. THE GOOD: -FOR PERSONAL LIGHTSABER DUELS, THIS IS THE MODEL TO OWN. Despite the lack of lights and sound, these things keep the experience authentic. The look and general feel are true to the universe, and since there's no sophisticated electronics, you don't have to worry about messing up the internal workings. So you can duel all you want with these things, and have no worries. -CREATES THE FEEL OF A REAL LIGHTSABER NICELY IN MANY WAYS. The saber extends and retracts, plus it has a belt clip you can use to carry it in the retracted state. As such, it's quite portable and easy to carry around. -EASY TO EXPAND AND RETRACT. The saber is easily expanded with the snap of your wrist and holding down the red sliding button. Once expanded, to retract it you just push down the expanded portions of the blade. -STAYS EXPANDED WELL. Unlike many other "expanding sword" type toys on the market, this one was designed well for the expanded state. It actually takes some work to get it retracted, so it likely won't fail when you need it. -CHEAP! These things are the least expensive Lightsaber replicas on the market, and as such, in the rare and unlikely event that you break one, you can easily afford and buy a replacement. -QUITE DURABLE FOR THE PRICE. These things can take a lot of abuse and still work fine, despite the low price. As such, they're ideal for many Star Wars fans, young and old alike. -SEVERAL DIFFERENT COLORS AVAILABLE. If it's a color of Lightsaber you've seen in a Star Wars movie, you can get it in this line. THE BAD: -NO LIGHTS OR SOUND. This is as much a pro as a con. Sure, you don't have to worry about damaging electronics, but without the lights, it's hardly a Lightsaber. I wish they had made an area where you could put in an optional pack for light and sound. That would have been a nice option. -EVERY ONE IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. Essentially, every one of these toys has the exact same hilt and only the blade color differs. But then again, I wasn't expecting much variance, seeing how this is a cheap toy. -SOMETIMES TOUGH TO RETRACT THE BLADE. Not a big deal, as I was worried more about the blade staying retracted. Still, it's a shame this isn't as easy as extending the blade. -NOT MUCH OF A COLLECTOR'S PIECE. If you want a nice collector's piece in the form of a Lightsaber, get one of the Force FX sabers. The product I'm reviewing here is a toy, plain and simple. OVERALL: Overall this is an awesome Lightsaber. If you want to have duels with your friends, this would be the best product to do it with. Sure, it lacks light and sound, but it's durable enough that you won't be breaking it anytime soon or having it get ruined. Overall, despite the flaws, I recommend these. EDITION NOTES: This is one of the most beloved Star Wars toys out there today. It's likely that it's going to remain widely available for quite some time to come, as Star Wars fans young and old alike love Lightsabers, as well as cheap stuff. 
I bought five of these for my own children and my nephews. They have had hours of fun "fighting evil." I would suggest keeping this toy strictly as an outdoor toy, as it is quite long when fully extended. Overall, my kids and nephews enjoy these and they have held up very well under some pretty rough play 
This is a good buy to the money. My son loves the way it flicks out and it is simple to operate. 
I bought a lightsaber like this one right before the realease of episode 3. I also bought a electronic color changing one which i thought would be way cooler then the basic lightsaber. Putting it quite frankly i was terribly mistaken. Sure the electronic lightsaber has the sounds and changes color but u cant even see it in daylight. Plus the basic lightsaber is half the cost of a electronic lightsaber. My friends and i play in the woods every day with our lightsabers. To tell u the truth i traded the lightsaber that changes color for YUGIOH cards. the only bad thing is it is not very educational. it is however quite entertaining. I think the worst thing is if you drop a lightsaber the handle will probaly get scratched or if u use them regularly the blade may be dented. Overall very good by i suggest u buy more and wait until they make better electronic ones 
I have no purchased one of these things yet, but my friends and I always goof around with them at stores. They are very strong and unlike the light ones, these go all the way in, come out with the push of a button and have a belt clip 
This is a cool toy because you can put it on your belt, and the blade goes in fully. Though it doesn't have the sounds, and least the blade goes into the hilt 
This Lightsaber is my favorite out of my 3.I also love the the black bottoms. It verey durable.I realy recomened this toy 
This plush was much smaller and stiffer than i thought it would be being that it is a Gund. I also found it much cheaper at Toys R Us (after I purchased it, of course!) I'm not sure if I would purchase this again if I had to. My son does love it though, he takes it to bed with him 
Order was received quickly. However I did find it cheaper at a local store 
Our son wants to take his cars and trains to bed with him and doesn't have any interest in stuffed animals. This was a nice compromise we could all be happy with. He has his train and we're not afraid he will hurt himself or choke on any parts at night. Or play all night! Perfect 
The honey bee tree is cute and easy enough to put together. The only difficulty is that the tree is supposed to be turned for each play of the game. Its hard to turn and pieces sometimes drop through when turning 
Ok, I don't understand the negative reviews for this game! This is such a fun great game. The little ones can play it because their isn't any reading involved. Yes, an adult has to take 5 minutes to set up. The leaves do not come out... I am not really comprehending what is being done wrong. And yes the game is quick... you have bees being balanced on leaves... after the first 5 pulls the bees begin to slowly drop on people. That is the purpose of the game afterall. It is fun and a quick game unlike some tedious games like "Candy Land". As a parent of 3 kiddies under 5... I am very happy when games are quick and fun 
My three-year-old received this for Christmas absolutely loves it. It's actually pretty fun for an adult, too. My only complaint would be that you have to turn the trunk of the tree to make the bees fall into each player's slot. This is difficult to do (especially for a four-year-old) without causing more bees to fall accidentally. We solved this by just turning the entire tree and each person keeps their bees throughout the game. Other than this problem, though, it's constructed very well 
Honey Bee Tree Game a wonderful game and lots of fun my 2year old plays it and she loves it hours of fun. 
We love this game! My 3 year old is excited to have his very own game that we all enjoy playing. I agree with the previous reviewer: stick a few branches all the way through at the beginning for support and then don't worry if the rest go through to the other side. This way, the kids can help, too, and no one gets bored with set up. All you need to do with the branches is create a nest, of sorts, for the bees to lie on. Theoretically, the winner is the one with the fewest bees at the end. In my house, though, the winner is the one with the most! My kids love pulling a branch and having bees tumble out into their trays. This has been a great fit into family game time at our house. 
It took several tries before I realized the "trick" to setting this game up more quickly. The branches enter one side of the hive and exit through a hole on the other side. At first, I found it frustrating to get all of the leaves through the exit holes. Then I realized that once you've inserted a dozen leaves or so, the rest don't have to exit. Then can just be popped in quickly and find support on the properly inserted brances. I didn't think the directions were as clear as they should have been. I definitley fell prey to the "award winning" sticker on the box when I bought this game. However, the more we play it, the more I see the educational value in it. My 3 year old is simply thrilled to learn turn-taking as we try to make the bees fall out. My 7 and 9 year olds are definitely more into the logic and competition of the game. All told, once you've mastered the branch issue, it's really a fun game and worth the space on your family game shelves 
It takes too long to set up (sticking all the leaves through the hive). By the time I'm done, the kids have lost interest. They had more fun just playing with the bees separately 
My daughter enjoys this more than I expected her to. We're hoping to finish it soon. Order/shipping were hassle-free 
My teenage neices LOVED it, even tho it seemed a toy for a much younger audience. It was quite beautiful and I considered ordering some for myself. I did have to order two for it to be big enough. 
I am not the biggest fan of Bratz Babyz,but once I saw the three I thought they changed my mind,did it? NO! I got Forever Diamondz Sharidan she is gorgy! 
A wonderful toy to take along with your little one since it packs itself into a suitcase by simply folding it up. The only flaw is that there is no slots to keep the crayons in, so they fall out. I am a child of the 70s and enjoyed Fashion Plates, so I was excited to see Disney put a Princess version out. I still have my original Fashion Plates, and will have to dig them out soon because I know my daughter will really enjoy them. This set features the Princess gang and you can change their outfits and color them in. The original Fashion Plates gave you the option to rub patterns into the dresses, and unfortunately this set does not have that option. We plan on using the pattern plates from the original set to decorate the Disney Princess ones. All in all, great fun, and would make a nice gift for any Disney Princess fan 
A game for 3-4 year olds that is actually AGE APPROPRIATE! This neither insults a young child's intelligence nor is too difficult. Anyone with a 3 year-old knows how tough it is finding a GAME s/he actually WANTS to play that teaches turn-taking, counting, and that losing is often only temporary (there are a LOT of position changes in the course of a game). The game is 100% luck, so an older child will become bored quickly, but if you have a 3-5 year old, GET THIS! As with ALL Gamewright games (I own 9 of them), they are simple (unlike Cranium stuff... gads- pieces everywhere!) and visually stimulating 
Leaping Lizards is a wonderful and compact matching game from Gamewright Games, who make a whole line of inexpensive, educational and fun board and card games. Instead of a conventional playing board, the game is played on a long cord which has beads strung on it. The spaces between the beads are the playing spaces, and players race to get their little wooden lizard to the end. Game play is relatively simple. Each player gets a set of "Creature Cards". Before every round, they pick one of their creature cards to be their match. Then the creature tiles (which are two-sided) and the lead lizard tile are shaken up in the provided cup and spilled out. If the lead lizard tile has a smiley face showing, the player whose lizard is furthest back in the line may move their lizard as many pieces forward as they have matched their creature card to the creature tiles. So if they chose a dragonfly as their creature card and three dragonflies are showing face up, they may move three spaces forward. If the lead lizard tile shows a sad face, the player whose lizard is at the front of the line must move their lizard back as many matches as they've made. Matching skills are the only essential skill needed for the game, kids who are still too young to read can play this game easily. It's also completely a game of luck, which levels the playing field between different ages of children. Because of this game's super-compact size, it makes for a great travel game. It'll work on airplanes or in back seats, and kids will have fun with it for hours. The illustrations are wonderful and the pieces are made with real materials. This is a great game 
My daughter, now seven, is in an advanced reading class. I thnk part of that reason is we encourage her to read and a big part of that was her using the leappad. This was one of many "books" that has helped to fuel her joy of reading 
This is a great leappad book. It has cards but they are only used for the last two pages. And as other reviewers have noted they are sturdy and there is a wild card for the off chance that you lose one. It is educational and interactive and fun for children. Any child that likes Stanley on TV or any child that enjoys animals should enjoy this leap pad book. 
Unlike most of what Disney makes for the Leappad (lame adaptations of big screen hits, with barely any educational use or any story at all), this book is DENSE with information and cool games. Now every time I happen to mention something about an animal my children (3, 5) come with facts that leave me with my mouth open ("did you know that hippos can sleep under the water?" and so forth). I think it's the best leappad book we have 
While my youngest son hasn't really watched Stanley that much, he loves animals. We got this book for him for his 4th birthday and he has spent many, many hours playing with it. 
My four-year old son loves this book. He plays with his LeapPad constantly and is good at changing the books/cartridges by himself. You only need the animal cards that come with the book for the last two pages; the rest of the book is typical LeapPad with games and music. The cards are small and could be easily lost, but I found that if you just store them in a small ziploc bag, it's not a problem. Also, the set comes with one WILD card that can replace any of the other cards, so if you lose an animal, just replace it with the WILD card when you need to. Kids who love the show "Stanley" or who just like to learn about animals will love this LeapPad book 
My 3 and 4 year olds will not play this game. The graphics are really bad and the learning adventure is more of a video game than an educational game. It is not very intuitive and my children are bright. Buy Blues Clues instead! 
I bought this for both my 6 yrs old daughter and my 7 yr old niece and they both love it. It aides their creativity and individuality. They learn about things like haikus and poetry, and my daughter loves to look back at pictures she let other people make and save. She LOVES Junie B. Jones and this is added to her list of favorites 
My 7 Year old daughter loves this game she loves all the activities she can do because we got this game she had to get the book version. Really good for teaching the kids how to use new words in there vocabular 
My duaghter received this one for her 7th birthday, and REALLY loved it! She wasn't a big Junie B. Jones fan, but she was encouraged to read the books AND her journal writing grades at school improved as well! I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone with a Leapster and a little girl who is entering that "Diary" stage. 
My oldest one love this it as secrets that she can but in and it remember she plays games and word sreach and unsramble the words . It as a Journal where Junie B Junies and the player shares and it is a great learning tool for any age group even MOM 
My grand kids love Leapster Junie B Jones is my granddaughter's favorite-she has all the Junie B Jones books, I wish they would make some more Junie B Jones games! 
I am very happy with this product as it opens both of my daughters imagination up! And it is neat to see what the thought of the day will be. I highly recommend this product to any little girl 
My 7 year old son LOVES Junie B and LOVES this cartridge! He enters in "secret" stuff about his life, draws pictures and plays word games. This is a MUST for any Junie B. Jones fan, and you even get to hear her voice read some of her "private beeswax" info! Too cute, and another great addition to our huge Junie B collection. Bravo to Parks and Brunkus 
My first grade daughter loves Junie B. This cartridge has encouraged her to write in the journal and to create poems. She loves that she can write anything in it and keep it secret with a password. I would highly recommend this game 
Bought this toy for my 2 year old girl. She absolutely loves it and play with it everyday. In the beginning, I had to help her putting the puzzles but now, she can do it on her own. Great learning toy 
This microscope is very difficult to focus; my daughter (8 years old) is not able to use it by herself. In addition, the view isn't very clear. I wonder if it's possible to get a good result with any inexpensive microscope. The up side of this product is that it comes with lots of fun accessories, including several pre-made slides that are interesting to view 
We bought this for a Christmas gift for our son. What a colossal waste of money. He was so dissappointed that it was so hard to use (even with adult help). My husband had to re-solder wire connections before we could even use it once. We would have been better off to buy a strong magnifying glass and the prepared slides and looking at the slides that way. Actually finding and focusing on a slide image was almost impossible due to the cheapness of this product. It was his "big" present and turned out to be a dud. We'd return it, but that would blow Santa's cover 
The microscope was everything I had hoped for except a faulty light. After contacting the vendor and explaining the problem, they sent a brand new microscope set. This is exceptional service and greatly appreciated 
My 6 year old son received this for Christmas and was very excited. The projection feature does not work well, but used as a basic microscope, it was just fine. The light stopped working after only one hour, but E-Toys customer service was fantastic, and offered a full replacement immediately and at no expense to me. This set comes with plenty of empty slides to make your own specimens, but it would be even better if it included more prepared slides (it only contains 5 prepared slides). Overall, a good first microscope for the price 
Cloe is a very cute doll, not as cute as the others, but cute. I got her on my birthday from my aunt. She has long golden blond hair about to her knees, with big blue eyes that SCREAM cute. The outfit she comes in is an off-white tank top with a short denim jacket with "buttons" on it. Her skirt is a velvety, stretchy light pink material with a white "studded" belt over it. Her shoes are white with gold little heart and a pink "stone" in the middles. Her second outfit is a long tunic top with swirls of cream, brown, pink, and green. She has blue jeans with little rips in the knees, and pink flats with silver decorations. Thanks for reading 
Girls love all versions of Bratz. As a mom, I think Bratz dolls look too mature for their presumed ages. The makeup is way over the top and their clothing can only compare to "ladies of the night". The Babyz underware can only be described as thongs. However, finally the Kidz version has improved upon that. The makeup is still strong, but more acceptable. The clothing is closer to what a kid would wear and the overall look is more innocent than other Bratz dolls. If you've also found Bratz dolls to be objectionable (even though I still buy them), the Kidz version is much more acceptable and my 7 y.o. daughter seems to like these better than any other version. 
in the past five years,i was more into barbie then bratz.i have all of her movies and have lots of barbie dolls.but when i saw this, i fell in love because she is cute.Cloe looks like barbie because of her hair and eye color.this doll is on my christmas list 
SHE'S NOT AS PRETTY AS THE GROWN-UP CHLOE DOLLS IN MY OPINION BUT SHE'S STILL A VERY PRETTY DOLL. SHE HAS THE SAME BEAUTIFUL BLONDE HAIR GORGEOUS BLUE EYES. AND HER CLOTHING IS FANTASTIC! SHE COMES WITH 2 COMPLETE OUTFITS. ONE WITH A FULL-LENGTH PAIR OF JEANS AND THE OTHER WITH A FULL-LENGTH SKIRT! NO SKIMPY CLOTHING HERE!!! GO MGA!!!!!! GREAT JOB ON THESE KIDZ DOLLS!!! 5 STARS!!!! 
When I went into Toys R Us today merely to check for new Barbie clothes for my Pullip dolls, I had no intention of buying this lovely girl. I skimmed through the Bratz section just to see what was there. My companion pointed out the Yasmin Kidz doll, and I thought she was very cute, but not my cup o' tea. I searched for a Cloe since she's my favourite- *Points to Cloe army* -and found her. I promptly fell in love. Her hair is very pretty, it reminds me of Sun-kissed Cloe's hair, minus the braids. Her face is very cute, and I like her body proportions. The clothes are well made, and she's the perfect size for carrying around. I cannot recommend her enough! If you like Cloe, you should defidentely get this girl. -Taff 
We gave this train set to our boys for Christmas. It's now January 9 and I think they've played with it every day since Christmas. I love that it doesn't have a lot of tiny, worthless trees and signs to get scattered around the house or lost. Our 4 and 6 year olds can easily build a different track every day and they really like using the crane. With 2 train engines and a truck that fits on the track all 3 of our boys can play without fighting. Thank you!! 
I bought this set to use with Thomas the Tank character engines and cars as it is compatible with them and the Thomas the Tank sets were so horribly expensive. I have always found the Melissa Doug toys to be of high quality and this is no exception. The items in the set, that I looked at, didn't have any markings so a young child would not realize that it was not an authentic Thomas the Tank set. Everything seems to work just fine with the Thomas the Tank engines and cars. I highly recommend this as an alternative to the exorbitantly-priced Thomas the Tank sets 
This set is wonderful and wonderfully priced too. We were going to buy the Thomas expansion set for $40 and when we saw this we bought it instead and got so much more! We use it with our Thomas and Brio trains and tracks and for a fraction of the price of the Thomas train sets you get a ton of tracks, trains and accessories. Great deal! We are going to get the Melissa and Doug train table also. It's so much more reasonably priced than most other tables and even has a storage drawer that does not cost extra 
I bought this set because my 5-year-old son has been begging for a Thomas the Train set and I cannot afford those prices! So I took a chance on this one, and I am THRILLED! The roundhouse is very high quality, almost identical to the Thomas the Train one which sells for $80. The set comes with lots of good quality wooden track (no splinters or sharp edges, and it all fits together fine), two bridges, a turntable, two cranes that are easy to operate, two trains, a truck, two people, trees, and signs. Best of all, you can build the exact display shown on the box and still have leftover track! No disappointment! My only complaint is that one of the little trains that came with it keeps losing a wheel. Not such a big deal for us, because we bought Thomas the Train engines to use instead (yes, they fit on the track just fine). This set is supposed to be compatible with Brio trains too, but we haven't tried those yet. 
If you like Monopoly and Nintendo this is the perfect game for you! I got it in perfect condition and I gave it to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day... he loves it! Playing it has been a blast! Great addition to our Monopoly collection! 
I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day because he's a huge Nintendo freak, and he absolutely loves it! I'm not a big Monopoly person but I'm actually curious to play through it. It was shipped and arrived very quickly, too. 
I bought this monopoly for my husband, who loves video games. He adores it! The pieces and spaces are absolutely perfect for any gamer 
As a Christmas present, Nintendo Monopoly was a big hit. It was a good variation on a classic game. Any Nintendo lover would like it 
This product was sent to my house sooner than I thought it would get here. It was in PERFECT condition! The Nintendo Monopoly game is REALLY cool! My boyfriend is 22 years old and he LOVES it also! EVERYTHING in the game pertains to Nintendo. The board is really colorful and has all the Nintendo characters we all used to love! I highly recommend Nintendo lovers getting this Monopoly game, because it makes Monopoly a whole lot more fun 
i've been a monopoly fan since my childhood days and the game never gets old. with these new nintendo characters they make the game even more intresting. this monopoly game is a plush for all you nintendo fans. good job thinking of this on 
Two classic games/companies brought together..you can't go wrong. If you like Monopoly and Nintendo, this seems like an obvious pairing. The cards are cute and clever. and as with any monopoly game, it always seems the games take forever, and we still haven't gotten through a full game. But I think the key is playing with 4 or more in order to make it go more quickly. 
Awesome pewter pieces, images of all the classic characters on the board, and clever chance and community chest cards make this a must have for anyone who considers themselves a classic Nintendo fan 
The toy box required relatively little assembly and it had clear directions. It's a nice looking, roomy box. The only reason that I didn't rate it 5 stars is because there is only one choice of finish. I would have preferred a golden oak color, rather than the lighter one 
I found this chest to be good quality, easy to assemble and very nice looking. The lid hinge is great, it works very well and my 19 month old has no trouble lifting the lid without injury 
I spent several weeks researching the best toybox to purchase for my 18 month old son. We were looking for 1)Safety 2)Durability 3)Value and 4)A toy box that would be a nice piece of furniture that would compliment the room where it will be utilized, as well as, something that a child would not outgrow (like a plastic multi colored toy box). Overall, I am very pleased with this toybox. It assembled rather easily (about 1/2 hr). The piece has a nice finish and looks great in our Living Room. Although, it is NOT a solid hardwood throughout, it is made very well and assembles easily. It is plenty durable for any child and has TWO great SAFETY hinges for the top cover. The top cover is partially hollowed and is lighter than a solid hard-wood cover, BUT is is very sturdy and made very well. I would recommend this toybox to anyone. The price was a little on the higher side, but it is worth it when compared to other comprable toy chests. You do get what you pay for. This is a good value! 
This is the best toy box. It holds a huge amount of toys, and my 18 month old has no problems opening or closing it. It only took 20-30 minutes to put together. I would definitly recommend it. 
I haven't had any of the problems stated in the reviews I've read. The lid is hollow plastic, so I don't recommend letting adults sit on it. I haven't seen any splintering or stress of the wood from the -very- sturdy hinges. Holds a lot of toys. I want the rest of the mission collection. I recommend this toy chest to anyone who has toys in thier living room and wants a piece that looks like furniture 
This toy box as well of the rest of the mission set from Little Tike is excellant!! The quality is superperb. All pieces are solid wood not cheap veneers...the only exception is the hollow core toy box top WHICH MAKES SENSE!!! I would not want a solid oak toy box top of that size slamming on my 6 year old, 3 year old, or 1 year old's head. There is also a divot in the top edge of all sides so than fingers don't get pinched. The top still holds all three of my children with no problem, a combined weight of 120lbs. I am very happy as well with the table and chair set and and the storage cabinet. I plan to pass these on to my grandchildren, they are commercial quality.  Eri 
Was looking for a nice sturdy, wooden toy chest to replace an overflowing toy basket and this was perfect. The quality of the wood is great, the design nice and simple, and the assembly wasn't bad at all. It took about an hour to do by myself while hubby was doing other things. The size is perfect for our house and the safety latch is a nice security measure. My 3 year old loves to rummage thru it for her toys and mommy loves the fact that the toys aren't cluttered everywhere. I highly recommend it 
From the picture this looks like it's a solid wood toy chest. Not so, the top is completely hollow and cannot support any significant weight. The only solid wood pieces are the edges and cross beams. Overall it's an OK piece of furniture for the price but don't be fooled by the picture, we were 
I was looking for a way to organize my son's toys because he has to play in our living room as our home is rather small. This definitely fits the bill. It is easy to put together and holds quite a lot of toys well. It goes well with our living room furniture and we're glad we bought it 
When writing isn't enough, and you want to infuse some excitement into your words, try the Fart Pen. The Fart Pen will make your words explode upon the page with a yet unknown vigor. In all seriousness, the Fart Pen is great 
we love this toy. we bought it to cheer up my son who broke his arm, and it certainly has worked. for $3.50, we are STILL laughing days later. and it writes! my kids are writing their christmas cards with this pen and even my 3 yr old loves it. a perfect stocking stuffer. for kids of ALL ages. : 
This is a fun game. Better with four players. We first played this on New Years Eve and had trouble finding the game because it was so popular and sold out everywhere. Its easy to learn and fun for parties 
I bought this game for my nephew and the entire family loved it. They insisted that we buy another so more people could play. The trouble is that I could not find another game on the store shelves after christmas, so I had to order online. I highly recommend this game to everyone 
I really expected more of this product when reading the description. Within 15 minutes of use, the antennae fell off of one. Upon examining it, I discovered that it was for decorative purposes only and had no useful purpose. We also had a hard time getting it to function properly. My granddaughter, who loves stuff like this, rarely plays with it. She wanted a REAL walkie-talkie and this one performs like a "pretend" one. 
Our daughters received these for a Christmas present. They were not able to use them. I read and re-read the manual without any help. Don't buy these 
I bought these walkie-talkies for my daughter. Neither the text nor the walkie-talkie part works. Save yourself the aggravation 
I couldn't find this particular Bionicle anywhere before the holidays. I was so happy to find it here. It arrived in the original packaging. My 7-year-old loved putting it together. This is a nice addition to his growing Bionicle collection 
sidorak is awesome! he`s the best bionicle set i have ever had!sometimes i keep him built. sometimes i do not. i really like his blazer hook thingy.if you are reading this,buy it for christmas.i hope you buy it 
I have resisted buying these because they seemed so cheap...also the usual question we parents always ask ourselves..."What are they going to do with them?" My son received his first bionicle from a friend on his ninth birthday...it was cleverly the "bow" on a birthday present. I now regret overlooking this wonderful line of "lego's" for so long! My boys love these! They have the best time building them and an even better time playing with them. They are priced reasonably so you can always pick-up one as a treat during trips out "shopping". If you encourage your children to "save-up" for some of their "wants", the cost of these is low enough that it doesn't take them months and months to realize their goal. Please do not make the same mistake I made and misjudge these toys. You will be denying your child a great experience. Although the manufacturer suggests ages 7 and up, I do not feel a child younger than 8 or 9 would be able to independently put this toy together. My 7 year old needs some help putting these together, but he loves to try all by himself. That is the point of Lego's, to construct and play. The primary benefit, in my opinion, is the satisfaction of "doing it" yourself! A definate A+ for our boys! Rosemary 
this is the most unpredictable toy. One minute he is ready to use his blade to cut down Vakama the next second his legs give way. pros and cons. pros: he is extreamly flexible like his rechorus queen roodaka so you can twist contort and spin him into odd angels. His hand is verey good at holding roters. cons: His shins are very small and rather weak. Also his shoeldersare rather bulkey 
Three of us played this game--two parents and our 11-year-old. The first game took a long time because we didn't realize a key part of the game was getting to/from the ports. We spend all our time "out at sea". But our 11-year-old still asked to play again two days later! The second game took about 20 minutes, was fast-paced and a lot more fun (but almost too short!). The third game took longer, and was still interesting. We waged battles and had a lot of fun with the games at each port stop. The clues and games were even fun and challenging for us adults. There ARE some gray areas about the rules, which unfortunately is common in most new games these days. But we easily came up with guidelines along the way, and there wasn't anything that kept us from enjoying the game. I'd also like to say that the setup and cleanup is a breeze--they actually designed the game box to hold all the pieces neatly once you put them away! This is another place where I think a lot of games today fall short 
My family enjoyed the Pirates movies so much that we couldnt wait to get this game. Once we started playing it we were very disappointed. It has no excitement in it. We thought it would have clips of the movies but but it doesnt. It is just moving ships around a map and collecting cards as your treasure. It takes a long time to do each turn since you have to put in your coordinates that your ship is on to see if you found any treasure. We played it for 2 hours and still were no where near ending the game. Be prepared for a long game if you buy this product 
My daughter 13 ask for this for Christmas, and we have played it as a family -it is very entertaining for those who enjoy board game, the added twist of interaction with the DVD makes the game relate to the younger family members while those of us who are slightly techno challenged don't have to worry because it is very simple to operate - if the kids will allow you to that is. Of course you should really be a fan of Pirates or at least a Johnny Depp fan in order to get the most from this game 
Yarrr! This game be ship loads of fun! Even me young daughter Grace (yes, named in part after Grace O'Malley) was able to sail the high seas. Unfortuneatly, I was her first target and was relieved of the burden of me entire booty by the third turn. We were rolling on the floor when one player was once again marrooned on Rum Runners island. Players made pacts, not in the rules...nor disallowed, they are more like guidelines... and consipired to block those players about to win. This game was fun from the time we left home port until we buried the booty. I recommend this game to everyone...we had no issues with scene delay in the DVD and the island challenges you play ellicited cheers (and jeers) of "YARRRR!" from all of the pirates sailing the board. The added dimension of fortune cards made it a risk to attack other ships, not to mentioned the black spot that lurks, even after you succesfully plundered a fellow pirates booty. Great game with many dimensions 
My dd did like this quite a bit, but at 4 she has grown out of it. Still, it held up well and makes lots of cool sound 
My little girl was One and half when I bought this sweet little house for her. Little People are a great pretend toy and the house is great addition. She is now almost 3 and still playing with this and all her little people daily. Your little girl will love this toy and so will you. 
First, I just love Little People toys!! Fisher Price has made a great beginner dollhouse with this toy! My daughter received it for her first birthday. She loves to move the people and enjoys making sounds with the house. She still plays with it occasionally at 18 months. I definitely think this is a 1st dollhouse - it doesn't have many pieces and there aren't many rooms. This is great for a 1-year old, but I purchased "My First Dollhouse" for my daughter for Christmas as a step up. So, if you're looking for longevity, I'd look into the other dollhouses FP makes. But, for younger children, I'm sure you won't be dissapointed with this one 
The one they are advertising is not the one you will receive. The one shown has nine sounds and no fluffy the cat. The one you will receive has three sounds and includes fluffy the cat. There are two models, so it is confusing. I've ordered this twice already and each time I didn't receive the one being advertised. I don't know why they don't advertise it for what it is. The model you get sells for about $30.00. Amazon is selling that model too. Ihave no idea why they don't correct this. I've already fallen for it twice. You would think I would have learned the first time 
My daughter received this dollhouse for her second birthday last March, and it was a big hit! 7 months later, I can tell you that she plays with it every day, and uses her little plastic dora figures to have parties in the house with the mommy and daddy and baby figures. She loves the sounds from the house, the computer, the toaster and the baby sounds. Our dollhouse has taken a lot of abuse, from being dropped multiple times, pushed off the table and such, and still looks great and works fine. What I like about it, is that unlike the overpriced and incomplete Dora dollhouse, all the parts come with this one, and fit neatly in the house, even when folded up. For the price, this is a durable, entertaining, educational and well made toy 
I originally bought Urban Myth over the holidays, struck by what a promising concept for a game it promised to be. How wrong I was. For starters the box is deceiving; the age recommendation is 12 and over which couldn't be further for the truth. This is definitely not a family game. The box, with the cutesy picture and tame questions posed on the back are misleading to say the least. At least 85% of the questions on our first go were fairly high in the morbidity/death factor (including one wince-inducing question about weather or not infant carcasses had been used as mob drug cartel. Mercifully, it was a myth.) I'm no prude, and would have had no problem with the topics had the game not made promises that the whole family could play. From now on I'll certainly investigate the content before inviting the kids to come join us. And, err- how can I put this? The shape of the game pieces are... interesting. Of course, I noticed this right away but just chalked it up to my dirty, dirty mind. But as soon as the kids left the room for a moment, the somewhat conservative mother leaned into me and whispered "Is it just me, or do those game pieces look like male _________?" So, yeah, this game gets a big thumbs down in the family friendly department. That aside, I'm afraid I cannot recommend the game adult players as well. Urban Myth also fails as a board game... as far as we could ascertain the board only served one particular purpose and a fairly feeble one at that. (The goal is actually collecting enough letter cards to either spell 'truth' or 'myth'.) Otherwise, you just mindlessly navigate the board until someone collects enough cards based solely on the questions. The board is almost entirely useless. Finally, the game's worst crime is the missed educational opportunity. When you play Trivial Pursuit and get a true or false question, the will give you the correct answer AND some additional information with said answer on the back of the card. This game only dryly indicates the tale as 'truth' or 'myth' WITHOUT any further information, like WHY it's a myth or why it's a truth or how it all got started as an urban legend to begin with. If there are no facts to back up either claim, then why should we to believe the answers? I know there is only so much space on the back of a game card, but SOME information would have been nice. What a waste. Hopefully someone out there will take this great idea and turn it into the great game I know it could be. Common boardgame idea guys! Do better. Try harder. 
This game is a lot of fun, but should be taken with a grain of salt. Not all of the legends listed as true actually are. Looks like the creators were taken in by some of the very urban legends that they are quizzing us on. (... 
My 2 yr old daughter loves it. And now can recognize all animals in the puzzle. I highly reccommend this produc 
The bright colors and little knobs are perfect for beginner puzzle solvers. The price is a great deal too 
This wooden puzzle is very high quality and should last a life time. All three of my girls have loved this puzzle and it is still in wonderful condition!!! The animals are cute and very colorful. The plastic pegs are safe since they are buried deep in the puzzle piece, and they help the very young enjoy this puzzle. I highly recommend this puzzle!!!! 
This is a great puzzle and my son loves it! He got when he was 18 months and has been able to work it from day one but still enjoys putting all the pieces in their place. It's a great way to teach the different animal names 
My daughter got a few of these Melissa Doug peg puzzles for Christmas, she is now 16 months old and has mastered all of them by now so I keep buying new ones, I love that she loves to sit down and do them, It is so wonderful to sit and help her and watch her learn! I think these are wonderful! She gets so excited to play with her puzzles 
I purchases this toy for my daughter last christmas, she has never even played with it once. I found out that she much more prefers woodboard puzzles that she can put together 
I bought this for my 22 month old daughter and from the moment I unwrapped it she didn't stop playing with it for 3 days. The pictures underneath the pieces are great for learning to match the piece to the puzzle. She also gets to learn what the animals are called. It's fun and a learning tool. The board and pieces are very sturdy and the quality of pictures are great. This toy stays out of the toy box and she puts it together atleast once everyday. I highly recommend 
My twin 2 year olds borrowed this puzzle from the library and loved it. We have borrowed as many of the Lights Camera Interaction puzzles as possible. It has helped with hand-eye coordination, as well as image recognition. My only problem was with trying to remove ink from the puzzle. We accidentally ruined the puzzle during cleaning, but this companies customer service was a huge help and took care of our replacement needs. I can't say enough great things about this company or its products 
All children love this---saying is a huge hit is an understatemen 
My husband bought the reef fish for our hot tub and it was fun. So, I purchased it for a friend who loves to fish and just got a hot tub. Instead, he put the fish in his koi pond as an experiment to see if the live fish would follow it. We thought the reef fish would just swim across the pond and run into the wall, but it is well balanced and swim in a nice circles around the pond. At first, the reef fish swam a little too fast for the koi, but they were interested...especially after an hour or so had passed and the batteries started to run low, causing the reef fish pace to slow 
These are a lot of fun, I bought them for my pool, even the pool people love them. I put them in the pool when friends come to swim. The only down side is theny do tend to end up in the skimmer and the batteries wear out pretty fast. I would recommend them for adults or kid 
A friend and I bought this for the pool to display during the 4th of July. The fish was by far the best of the various swim toys. Everyone loved it and it looked real 
The Rainbow Reef Fish swims great and is just a whole lot of fun for the kids to watch and play with. Great pool toy 
I bought this toy thinking the kids were going to have fun with it in the pool. They did, but only for a very short time. After the batteries died and we changed them to new ones it became a submarine. It dropped to the bottom of the pool and never re surfaced. Very frustrating 
Hi I am 11 and I have a pool in my backyard and it was just a regular pool just to swim in and hardly do anything in it accept well..... just swim!!!! But then one day me, my mom, my dad, and my brother all went to toys r us for a intertube because the one that we had popped. And then the " Rainbow Reef Fish" cought my eye. Then I picked it up and asked my mom and dad if we could get it for the pool. They said yes we could but only if we payed for it with are own money which I happened to have my money with me in my pocket that day. So when we got home I got my bathing suit on and got the fish and I jumped right in the pool to play with it. I WAS SO EXCITED!!! This is a GREAT toy! And it is especially fun to go underwater with goggles and look at it swim from underneath the water. I highly reccomend this toy. And for the people who said that it stopped working. The just get a new one it could have been the fish. But it is worth the money 
Very happy with the product and how it arrived in the time span it was suppose to. Will certainly do busy with this seller agai 
i've found all of the cars by going to every toys r us, walmart, walgreens, kb toys i was near (NC, NY, NV) however i still have not seen chicks or the king 
Just in case you wonder if it's another collection, it's the same metal cars as in the "normal" or regular edition. It's only from another country or provider (I guess). But they have the brilliant idea to develop more cars from the movie. Well, not more cars but more variant models. For example, they have this version of McQueen (as it looks in the last part of the movie). They have the first Mater (not the re-colored one from the bowling game) with the complete nose (you get that), Dirt mcqueen (like the one from one track game), Hudson hornet! yellow ramone. I has uploaded the back cover of the box just for your entertainment. It has the whole catalog! In Peru it costed me $9 each but they are so hard to get. As it happened here they just disappeared from the regular stores. 
I bought it as a present for someone who never had one because her parents thought it was a waste of money when it first came out 
This game was given to one of my sons when he turned 5. It's been a big hit ever since. The game is basically a no-reading-required version of Bingo. The kids love it. Even my 2 year old gets to play and doesn't need help. All the kids, ages 2, 5, 5, and 8 like this. The game is nice and sturdy, very well-made. You won't be disappointed. This would be a good gift because it's fun there isn't a very good chance most kids already have it 
I bought this for my 3-year old son and he thought it was cool for a few minutes but my 4-year old nephew really took to it and did not want to take it off. I do wish the cape was made out of something more cloth-like rather than PVC type material which is why this only got 4 stars 
Overall, this is a cute little set to dress your child like Superman w/o spending lots of money. It comes with a vinyl cape, Superman plastic chest emblem, and plastic chain to pull apart and pretend like you're the man of steel. It will probably fit an average child up to about 6 or 7 years old. The chest shield has velcro straps on the top and bottom that stretch around the child's arm/shoulder area - so if your child is particulary large, it may not be comfortable to wear this. The vinyl cape attaches with velcro at the neck. One of the velcro tabs fell off and the vinyl started to rip (underneath the tab area) the very first day my son wore this. We took it back and exchanged it for another one. Even though the cape doesn't seem extremely durable, I'd still recommend it as a fun accessory for any little Superman fan. One more thing... I think the cape and Superman shield would look better in RED instead of the reddish brown color they ended up using. I'm not sure how many kids would care too much about the color though! 
I was very pleased with my purchase and it was exactly the toy my Grandaughter was looking for, she has enjoyed it since Christmas and could not be happier. It has also taught her Spanish which I feel is very educational to her. 
I got this doll for my 4 year old for Christmas. she wanted the Hispanic doll because she says it is "the cute one". I think it looks more babylike than the other two. She loves to play with her, especially feeding her food and her bottle. We haven't had an problems with her eating her food and you just need to slightly squeeze the bottle. We bought Pampers preemie diapers and they fit great and are much cheaper. Baby alive also fits into preemie clothes perfectly. I do have a few complaints though...the first time I wiped off her face the paint on her lips came off, her hair looks terrible unless you are far away b/c it is so thin, and she needs some more phrases to say (no she's not in trial mode). Overall, I think that this is definitely the most life like baby doll on the market right now and my daughter thinks she is the best toy ever. 
I purchased baby alive for my six year old daughter. She absolutely loves her. This a great buy, but keep in mind she does require food, diapers, and clothes. The baby alive diapers are expensive, and are hard for my daughter to put on her so we buy preemie diapers from walmart. The only complaint that I have is that the color on her lips does come off so we found a sharpie of similar color to put on them. Other than that she is a great doll. My daughter is very particular so I am happy that she likes her 
I love this doll and so does my 2 year old and my 5 year old. I couldn't get the 2nd one before Christmas and just got the Hispanic version, which I think it cuter (at least on the computer) than the Blonde Caucasion baby. My daughters only speak spanish from Dora the Explorer, but this may help them - and my 2 year old doesn't care which language she is speaking, she seems to know what she wants! Anyway - I would suggest this doll for anyone! I EVEN LIKE PLAYING WITH HER!! LOL :-) I do agree with the not enough diapers and too much food. Right now we are just "Pretending" that she is eating, so we don't waste the diapers. I'll give her an A++ her hair is thin, but her head is dark, so you can't tell. Not sure what the blonde hair will be like 
My biggest complaint with this doll is that her hair seems to be a little thin. This does not seem to bother my daughter who got her for her birthday yesterday, she loves her. She does speak english but it took my older daughter (12) to figure out exactly how long to hold the button in on the bracelet. I think the doll should come with more than two diapers, especially considering she comes with 3 packs of food. Overall, I'm satisfied because my kid is happy with her but would recommend anyone buying the doll to have plenty of diapers on hand 
My daughter received this doll for her bday and absolutely loves it. It does speak both english and spanish you just have to hold down the button on the bracelet to switch the language. 
The fact that I could order the game was a plus. The fact that it couldn't be shipped to me because I have an APO/FPO address made me mad. I had to send the game to my father, and then have him send it to me. I was trying to order the product as a gift for a friend. It was given to him a month later rather than on his birthday like I wanted to. I'm assuming the game was okay because I had to give it to him late. I don't understand why I can order some games through Amazon and get them, but not other games of the same kind. This needs to change. 
This game asks questions about the Marvel Universe, mostly the recent trend in movies, but also some questions about the actual comic books and popular characters in various franchises. The questions are relatively easy, but if you're playing with other people, this is part of the fun, as you race to see who can shout out the answer first. The DVD game modes are diverse and interesting, including clips, comic book covers, and other games based on either pictures or words (fill-in-the blank, scramble, etc.) If you enjoy Scene It! (basically Trivial Pursuit with a DVD), then you'll like this game as well, as it is similar to other games in the franchise 
My daughters love this game. It is very cute, and they enjoy it. We really like making the tractors tip over! The only negative thing I have to say is the pieces are very small, and replacements are not available. 
The game has weak content and strategy. We played it twice but neither of us experienced any excitement. The game is now shelved and I don't foresee it ever being played again. Disappointed but somehow not surprised. 
My 3yr old has watched Cars innumerable times. His favorite part of the movie is Frank chasing McQueen and Mater. This game is it! The pieces are small but more detailed than I expected. Frank in particular is ok. The game itself is again better than I expected (I had very low expectations). You move around the board, tipping (collecting) tractors along the way. You roll a dice to see how far to go, one side of the dice causes Frank to wake up, move to another spot. And he'll chase you back to the start if you're in the way. My 3yr old loves it. The there are numbers on the bottom of the tractors that you're supposed to add up. But thats too much work, we just count how many tractors there are, or just roll the dice and try to wake up Frank... or just play with the pieces 
My six-year-old saved his money and spent it on this game. The movie tie-in lured him to the purchase. We've played the game a few times. I'm still not completely clear on the rules. The "points" assigned to the tractors are impossible to read - in fact my son, who wears eyeglasses, cannot even tell where they are. He prefers the old classics, Monopoly Jr., Sorry, Trouble, Mousetrap, and Scrabble Jr. to this game. Purchase one of those instead 
My son is 5 years old and loves this game! He loves making the silly sounds when he tips a tractor. Also, it helps him with counting and how to keep score. It's well made. The numbers on the bottom of each tractor are a little hard to read. It's somewhat eduacational and a lot of fun 
I have a three and a half year old son and all he wanted for Christmas was the "mean tractor Frank". Frank happens to be the ONLY vehicle they did not make. This game has it!!! Out of the hundreds of presents he recieved over the last three days, the little Frank out of this game is his FAVORITE toy in the world. Oh and he also likes to play the game. The pieces are extremely tiny. But my 2 year old also does well with them. 
I havent even seen the movie this is from, but this little guy is a fun figure! Very thin, but very posable, he's a great addition to a cubicle or anywhere. 
I bought this unit for my [...]daughter, and I must say I really enjoy it. It is well made, and has the common sense features needed for a [...], such as the encased cd-rom games, No scratches!!! (now I only wish Disney would do the same with there movies so I wouldn't have to buy 4 copies of each movie!) The unit comes with "Jumpin' Bean Island", and I bought Spongebob and the Disney Princesses, but I must say, the "Jumpin Bean island game is the best of the three. It's educational approach is very, very good, covering math, reading, memory, etc. Tow thumbs up from the Jay-man! Perhaps I could have just bought some educational games to play on my PS2, but then what would I do?!?! 
These replicas of a butterfly's life stage are a great assest in the classroom. The students are able to closely examine the replicas and really understand each stage more clearly. My son got a hold of these before I could bring them to my classroom. He is 3 and he enjoyed looking at each piece. Eventhough, he didn't understand all of the stages he knew about caterpillars and butterflies. These would be great for a classroom and/or for a child who is interested in the world around him/her. 
I'm a huge fan of LeapFrog toys. But this one never clicked for my twins. When they were younger it took to long to accomplish each turn and as they got older, it was just boring. At every turn, the game tells kids what to do, then they find a letter card and put it in a special slot. But there's just so much talking and singing going on, the kids get bored. They want a game that moves quickly and this one doesn't do it 
You know, I found this game to be quite annoying (there is a lot of singing in between each players turn)- but my 5 year old son loves it. There is no dice, no spinner (so none of those pieces to lose :), but it tells you how many spaces to move. So, one player with an easy question may get to move 8 spaces, while a player with a hard question only gets to move 3 spaces. I guess that's a plus because you can't cheat (it even tells you which color you land on), but in the process, it makes the game rather simple. My son would rather play by himself so that he doesn't lose. The questions are not challenging for my son (he just turned 5 in May), so i guess it gives him a since of "Hey! I'm smart, I know all of this stuff" 
I bought this for my grand daughter's 4th birthday and was so disappointed at the look on her face when she opened it. "It's green!" with quite a pout. So, you can imagine how thrilled I was when my daughter called me later to tell me that this is now her favorite game and she loves watching the video that is along the same line that I had given her at the same time. Needless to say, it made me a happy grandma 
We purchased this game for my just-turned 5-year-old. He loves to play both levels. His almost 4-year-old friend enjoys limited play, and a 2-year-old loves just looking at the cards, calling out the letters, and playing with the plastic figures. A couple of the letter sounds are very similar, but it is teaching Alec to listen carefully and not get discouraged if he gets an answer wrong the first time. It is also nice that there is no one "winner." Anyone who reaches the "winners" square is a winner. My son sometimes just randomly calls out letters and the sounds they make. Very good for getting him ready for school in a few months 
I am a big fan of the Letter Factory DVDs so when I saw this game, I was very excited. It did not disappoint! It is a great game because you can play with just one person. So, you can have your child play it alone for fun learning or with you or with siblings/friends. It has two different levels so the game grows with your child. My only complaint is that the cards get messy on the board. They should have put little slots or something to hold them in place on each letter. If your child needs a fun way to learn colors, letters, sounds, and counting ...this is the game for you! (I recommend having them watch the DVD of Letter Factory Letters and/or Words before playing - same characters). 
My son received this game for his 3rd birthday and he loves it. He already knew some of his letters but not necesarily the sounds that go with each letter. He has only had the game for a few weeks and has learned many more letters, more sounds, and songs that go with each letter. I also have a 5year old that enjoys this game. It is too easy for him, but reinforces what he is learning in school and is one of the few games that he enjoys playing with his brother that he doesn't think are "baby games". Another thing that I like about this game is that it can be played with just one player. I have set this up for him a few times on the kitchen table while I cook supper and he can play with just supervision 
We got this game because our daughter became obsessed with her letters. At 2 yr old, she loves it, participates and it is easy enough for her to play at both levels. Professor Quigley does talk a lot so the game takes a while to play but it also helps us practice our patience and listening skills. Would highly recommend!! 
My son (currently approaching 15 months) is totally obsessed with cars and trucks, and has been pretty much from the time he was old enough to hold a toy car in his hand. Even car ads on TV drive him crazy with joy. As a compulsive shopper, I buy him toy cars and trucks all the time. :) Out of all of his toys, this set may be his favorite. He loves to zoom the cars across the floor (they roll very easily, even on the carpet) and also to take them apart and put them together. It's a little hard to pull the first piece off when taking them apart, so his mom or I has to help him with that, but it's OK -- he can take the second piece off and put them back on just fine. (We sometimes use his other Mega Bloks to put together big crazy vehicles using the parts from these three trucks -- it's hard to see from the picture, but each truck consists of two top pieces and a chassis piece, all of which connect up with any other Mega Bloks.) By the same token, they are very sturdily put together. He of course throws them and drops them on the floor sometimes, and because they are hard plastic, they make a very loud noise on the tile, but there hasn't been so much as a hairline crack. I can see them lasting until he outgrows them. The set does seem a little expensive for the amount of stuff you get (we actually bought it for much less at a discount store), but in hindsight, my son loves this toy so much and it's so sturdily built that it would have been worth the retail price. 
We love this game. My girls ages 8 and 6 and I play this game in the evening. They have both been struggling in math, which is not uncommon in girls their ages. We have tried to reduce the gender bias in math skills by providing materials that enhance math understanding in young children, unit blocks, sand and water play and cooking activities. We just couldn't break through the wall. Last Christmas I bought Dino Math Tracks along with other math related games. This was the breakthrough we have needed. Both girls math skills and understanding of math concepts have improved by leaps and bounds 
A great game for giving kids practice with place values. They love to play it because of the dinosaurs 
I bought this to help my second grader enjoy math - which she was struggling with at homework time, not "getting" math concepts. She immediately took to it from day one and said it "made math fun". I like the three or even more different levels in which one can play the game. To acclimate, we played the easiest way and then moved up to the next level by game two. It is a fun game, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the dinosaur theme appealed to my girl as well as it might a boy 
She already knew how to add and subtract, but place value was a new concept for her. Boy, she learned it immediately, the game was so much fun for her and add in the cards and you have more addition/subtraction practice in there as well! ;) She loves to play this game, I really like the concept and the bright colors. I just love it when learning is fun for children! That is how it should be, not dry or boring. Your child will love this game. 
My 5 year old who likes dinosaurs LOVES this game. Basically its a racing game that teaches math. It has 3 different levels of learning/difficulty, so he will be able to play it for awhile! It goes by quick enough that he doesn't loose interest. Great game! 
This game is great! The tiny dinos spark my 5 year-old son's imagination and enable him to have so much fun that he does not realize he is learning. Furthermore, he does not want to stop!!! He learned place value up to the thousands during our first game. After each roll of the dice the player uses all four dice to make a number and then s/he reads the number aloud (i.e. if you roll 6666 you say six thousand six hundred and sixty six). As we move our dinos around the board T.R. looks forward to our pieces landing on the same track so that we can have a "Showdown". In a "Showdown" you simply have to roll a dice and the person who gets the larger number wins. However, we move our dinos to the middle of the board and have a miniature battle. The player who rolled the larger number wins the battle. The loser is sent back home and the winner gets to move ahead. After playing the game a couple of times without using the cards - which is the simplest level of play with this game - my son asked to use the cards. So on Day 2 we began using the cards. Again he uses his imagination and does a great deal of role play as he carries out the instructions. It fills my heart with delight to see his excitement and to see that he has truly learned how to read numbers up to the thousands. (T.R. learned to read when he was 4 so he independently reads the dice and reads the cards.) As a parent I highly recommend Dino Math Tracks because kids quickly learn a lot while having loads of fun. This game can be played at three levels, so it grows with your child 
My child loves this game! Each person has a single type of dinosaur in four different colors. Each color represents one of the placement values; Ones, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands. The dinosaurs, as determined by roll of four dice, have to walk their color-coordinated path from start to finish. But look out! If an opponent lands on the same space, a die-rolling duel ensues, with the high-roller prevailing. This basic game is a lot of fun for young children. Then there are two decks of cards, one more advanced than the other, which enable the parameters of the game to expand with the child's developing math skills. My child and I can play on even ground - a rare trait in today's games. This comes highly recommended 
This teaches both color and shape recognition, while being a fun toy in the bath. My son loves bath time, and any time I can make it fun and a learning time, it's a good thing. 
I wanted to get my 20-month-old some fun but educational bath toys and found that the market is greatly lacking. I decided to order these hoping that they would be solid plastic and not hold water. I won't buy the squirt type toys anymore for my son because they are impossible to keep clean and have to be thrown away after a few months. Needless to say, these are squirt toys even though the description says nothing of it. I was willing to give the toys the benefit of the doubt because I really liked the shape matching features and my son is at the stage where he loves matching shapes, colors, etc. I took them out of the mesh bag, which is great to have for bath toys though they could have included a suction cup for hanging it up, and I realized that the plastic on some of the turtles is extremely flimsy. When my son tries to match the shells to the turtles, the body of the turtles just cave in and he can't get it on. Not all the turtles are this way, but most of them are. I regret wasting my money on these. What a rip off! Avoid at all costs! If you're looking for a fun, open-ended yet affordable tub toy, try the tub stickers by Alex. There are a bunch of varieties, they are super easy to clean and come with a mesh bag with suction cups to hang up in your bath or shower to drip dry. My toddler LOVES them 
We bought this game to use at a "carnival themed" birthday party. It is very well made. The graphics are very nice. It was appealing to kids of all ages 2-14 (and some adults too) 
My Grandson just turned 1 yr old. We got the tunnel out, he crawled right through it. Loved it, was not afraid at all. We will be looking into connecting another tunnel to it the next chance we get 
It's amazing how something so simple can spark excitement and enthusiasm in babies and toddlers. A friend had this out at her 1-year-old's party and all of the kids loved playing in it and carrying it around as if it were a long train. My 8.5 month old watched all the other kids crawling through and having so much fun that he crawled over and peered down the tunnel. I thought he'd be too scared to go through, but since he seemed curious I decided to sit him up on one side while I ran to the other and spoke to him. Instantly, he smiled at me and started crawling toward me through the tunnel. He was laughing and seemed to enjoy the interesting view and sensation of going through the tunnel. Since he's still working on his crawling and seemed to love the tunnel so much, I bought one from our local Toys R Us store and he loves playing with it! What's great: - Folds up to a compact ring for storage/travel - approximately 19" diameter (size of the tunnel) and 2-3 inches thick. - See through windows allow for added fun/peek-a-boo - Velcro tabs to connect to tents and other tunnels gives added flexibility to how it can be used - Encourages crawling/floor time in babies - my little guy also likes to sit up and look around in it, or just lie around and rock in it (since it's free-standing). Considering that he's just discovered standing and and can't seem to get enough of pulling himself up on everything, it's a good way to keep encouraging him to strengthen his crawling/sitting skills. Durability: - It seems relatively sturdy, and really "pops" open nicely. Don't know how it will stand up in the long-term. - Be careful with the velcro on the mesh windows - it can stick to the windows and snag it a bit. - At my friend's party, I did notice that the older kids (3-4 years old) really wanted to jump on it and smush the walls - not a good idea in case there are kids still crawling through the tunnel and/or because the tunnel walls are not meant to withstand that kind of play, but from their point of view, I can see how tempting it may be to jump on it and see the tunnel pop back up. 
My four year old daughter loves this tunnel. She likes that she can look out the two windows also. I love that you can fold it up into a 2" circle and put it away 
I gave this to my nephew for his first birthday and he and my other nephew (4 years old) love it! It was a huge hit and their favorite gift. I like it because it gives them hours of play and it folds up and can easily be stored 
Not exactly sure why the recommended age is over 3 years old. My son is 10 months old and as long as your child is playing with the tunnel under supervision there is no reason that they cannot use this product sooner. Love the fact that it slinks up so compact when not in use and for travel. My son will play peek-a-boo and then crawl through the tunnel to come get me on the other side. He can also sit up inside the tunnel without a problem being that he is still younger. He did get mad however, at the fact that he tried to stand up inside the tunnel and could not, guess we will have to get him the tent that attches. Which brings on another good point, this product can be fit to many other products for increased fun (tent, another tunnel, etc.). Leads itself to many options. Would recommend 
My 15 month twins love this tunnel. They giggle and chase each other in it every day. Definately would recommend this toy 
Our daughter loved playing in the box from her Toddler Carseat so we thought this would be something she could enjoy too...and not EAT like she started doing with the cardboard box! It was a winner! On her One year birthday we gave it to her and she crawled right thru it instantly! She giggled and squealed from end to end of the tunnel as we would "chase" her thru the opposite end. SO MUCH FUN for her and both her Dad and I!!! We live in a townhouse, space is limited and having this tunnel that expands to 6 feet long is great for her to play with but quickly becomes a hassel to get around. It collapses and we store it in the closet but it becomes so flat you could put it nearly anywhere- behind the couch or under the bed. Also, it has the velcrow on the ends so you can buy the other matching parts to make it larger, like the "House tent" or andother play tunnel. You can even buy the tunnel and house tent together, or separately like we did. This is such a grand toy and VERY VERY well made! I love that it has the two screen windows sewn into each end you can look in/out and help ventilate it. I HIGHLY recommend this toy!!! 
My daughter is 1yrs old and this is her absolutely favorite toy! She spends endless hours day in and day out in it. Her 7yr old Aunt plays with her in it everytime she comes over too. It folds up and expands with in seconds. It really is a MUST HAVE toy for any toddler!! We are even buying a second tunnel to attach them together for her 2nd birthday. My advice: "Just buy it" 
Not bad, but I had a slight problem with the mine staying closed. I had to bend a plastic pin to get it to stay locked. I paid $5.29w/ free shipping, inexpensive 
If you want to expand your train set 5 cars at a time, this pack features Henrietta, who has been discontinued for a long time, and is now only available in this pack. If your child enjoys acting out the Thomas Friends episodes, Henrietta is Toby's coach. Like Toby, she is old-fashioned and has seen better days. Not many passengers ride in her, but she doesn't mind. She's mainly only used for giving passengers tours of the Sodor farm. If you missed Henrietta a long time ago, then this pack is a MUST HAVE! Don't forget, since Toby is included in this pack, he and Henrietta will make a great team 
Wooden Thomas cars. Many discontinued cars in this pack. My son is a major Thomas fan and loves this set. A bargain as many of these cars sold individually would cost $12 plus each. 
I received my train in a most timely fashion and I was very pleased with the item. It's constructed out of metal with very little moving parts which is ideal for little engineers. I was as I say again I was very please with my polar express train. 
My boys love their trains! I got two so they could each have their own. They work well on Thomas the Tank Engine tracks 
Found a battery operated Polar Express item on Amazon that I could not find locally anywhere. Order was processed promptly and shipped promptly. Solved one of my Christmas shopping problems 
My grandson is a Polar Express Train expert. He was very disappointed that the train didn't really look like the movie train. He liked the whistle, but that was a very expensive whistle. 
What a neat toy! This has been the BEST addition to our train set for quite awhile. My only complaint is that the coal car should be a little larger but other than that, this thing is nothing short of awesome. My little one plays and plays with this thing and we've had it for over a year now. It is clearly the favorite and I've now been told that I can get rid of all the other trains but we HAVE to keep the Polar Express. This is made by Brio so it doesn't really have all the details the Thomas trains have but it's no less entertaining. It doesn't use batteries that much - ours last at least a couple of months before wearing out. It's just a very neat way to bring the movie to life in your own home and quite the treasure. If you can find one (try ebay), grab it. It certainly is worth every penny. Great toy, highly recommend 
My daughter (4) absolutely loves this train. We've had it about a year, and I found her sleeping with it the other night. The sounds are great, and she likes that it moves bacwards and forwards (although it needs help mastering steep hills). My complaint is that ours sucks the life out of batteries EXTREMELY quickly...it doesn't seem normal. I don't know if its just ours or if all of them work in the same way, but most of the time the batteries are dead and she just plays happily with it making her own noise. If I had to do it over I would consider the one without batteries -- I really think she would have loved it just as much. However, she is overjoyed when I put in fresh batteries and quickly wears them out again 
As a big fan of the Thomas trains my little boy likes this engine even though it does not have a lot of detail. The fact that it has train noises, goes backwards and forwards and the lights work go along way! We went to the movie and have read the book. Now we have been sucked into buying the train. I love America 
I bought this for my son as soon as he started pulling up to stand. At two and a half he still plays with it. My only complaint is one of the parts stopped working after a while. Other than that it's a great toy. I have even sent this as a gift 
Excellent learning table .. bought this for my 1 year old grandson and he loves it.. Excellent !! 
We received this as a gift for my first child (now almost 3 years old). She loved it, my latest addition (9 mo) loves it, and I love it because there is a lot of things to do on it, it's shorter than the other standing toys we have (easier to pull up), it's sturdy when pulling up, and doesn't slip around when leaning against it like other standing toys we have. After almost 3 years, it still works fine (and the 3 year old will still play with it when the baby does) 
Wonderful toy!! Lots of fun music and learning!! Lots of fun activites also!! 
We got this for our 11 month old and right away it was a hit. It is very infant friendly, especially with the light up features to capture the attention. Our daughter is a big fan of music and seems to enjoy the tunes on this product very much. The bowl in the center works great to put stuff in, but she also likes to grip it like a steering wheel! All in all, we are very satisfied with our purchase 
My daughter loves it. The table helps her to stand up and she bounces to the music. 
My son *loved* this toy!!! He played with it so much that we will be hanging onto it for the next baby . This and the Laugh and Learn Learning Home (still plays with that one at 16 months) are toys that he has gotten so much use out of. I highly recommend this toy 
I am 6 1/2 years old. I like Pig Pile because I can play it with my whole family. Pig Pile can be a little hard when you are learning how to play, but it is still fun. I only had to play it twice to get the idea of how to play 
Trust me, this is the BEST, Most FUN game. We bought it to play with our then-7 yr old. We soon were playing it with our family and friends. It is a favorite when we get together. You cannot go wrong buying this game 
It's hard to find games that 16 to 18 year olds will play. Pig Pile has become a household favorite. One of my daughter's boyfriends won't play any other games with us unless we start with his favorite, Pig Pile. I plan on buying one for him to take when he goes to college in the fall. Though the pigs are only used for scoring, they provide entertainment by playing with poses while waiting your turn. The description of play has already been explained by others so I won't go into detail. Suffice it to say, it's great for all ages 
This was a blast to play. We played with my neighbor's kids who are 6 and 8 and we all had a great time. I LOVE those little pigs 
Pig Pile is a cross between War, Crazy Eights, and Uno. The winner of each hand collects pigs as the game goes along. The cards have funny drawings of pigs on them. Be sure to play your "Hog Wash" card when available because the hand could go on for a while if you don't. An overall fun game for any family 
This game is so great as a way to get a group talking. I love the huge selection of cards and the millions of ways people can play them. I have played this game for hours at a time and loved the interaction and fun. You will too 
This is a game in which all ages can participate. That is its greatest recommendation along with the fact that it is easy to learn and allows interaction between all the players 
I am happy with the game and the condition that it arrived in and the timely manner in which it arrived. It is a great game for a group of people. 
Apples to Apples Crate Edition was a big hit. I gave it to my niece for Christmas and the entire family ( I was in Florida for Christmas ) said it was a big hit and fun to play 
We first played with 12 people...lots of fun. The second time with only 4 people it was not as much fun..the more people the more fun. 
This game is a great game no matter your age. I am a college student; I have played with parents, friends, my younger siblings and more. It is so much fun, easy to explain and well worth it! I recommend it. The larger games' packs are good for larger parties b/c you go through the cards so fast. ENJOY!! 
This was a real fun game. Easy to learn for the whole family. We even had our five year old intereseted and playing along. The best thing about this game is the arbitrary nature of how the winning card is chosen. It can be completly random. Some of the cards laid down for a given question can be really wacky making for a fun and entertaining experience for young and old alike. We litteraly had ages ranging from 5 to 76 playing one night and everyone was laughing and having fun. The crate edition is made of very strudy wood which should ensure the game will be kept in good shape longer than in a cardboard box. The game is worth every penney.. 
Fun for a family of four or more, and for a couples get together. I only read about this game in Amazon, and I kinda liked what I read, but believe me it is Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun. We started playing it, and it doesn't take much to learn. I love to win some of the rounds in this game, but I have to admit the fights with the judges are fun too. This never failed to amaze me. We played it over a dozen of time now, and we only had it since Christmas. Every game has it's moments. If you like party games this one is for you. If you like arguments this one is also for you. If you like to make jokes this one is for you too. Man you should see what some of these cards say!!! : 
Apples to Apples is great fun! We have made multiple purchases of this game. Playing it in groups of widely varying backgrounds can cause fits of laughter or incredulous, aghast looks. We have played this game on 3 continents - N. America, Europe, and Asia. Playing cross culturally and with people whose first language is not English, brings a new perspective. For example, playing with a Japanese Diplomat and his wife we were taken aback by his playing the card "Bombing Pearl Harbor" for a match to "Fabulous". Definitely different strokes for different folks! A family in China had so much fun playing the game that we bought a game set and sent it to them. Like I said - it is great fun 
You deal the cards, show the green apple card, everybody turns in a red apple card, and hilarity ensues. Each hand inspires discussion and chuckles. I liked the variations suggested in the instructions, such as dealing all green (adjective) cards and finding the best match for a red (noun) card, or trying to find the least-fitting match, or just turning in a red card blindly before seeing what the green card says. The judge can determine how to play the hand, and my favorite part, the decision of the judge is completely arbitrary, meaning you can pick whichever card you like. It's easy, fun, and a game can be as long or short as you like. There is a lot of shuffling involved, since you will go through a lot of cards quickly, so have someone on hand who knows how to shuffle a deck of cards. Recommended 
Some complain that many of the cars toys are overpriced---they are probably right, however, since I couldn't find all of the toys in the stores in my area, I am just happy that I was able to get them from Amazon.com. The huge smile on my son's face when he saw the DJ car was well worth the additional cost. Thanks Amazon! It's not Amazon's fault that the demand is greater than the supply right now 
Both my 6 and 7 year olds love these Tamagotchi toys. They enjoy having them connect and interact and I enjoy that it teaches them some responsibility for a future pet! : 
This kitchen is very nice and also high quality. It has everything the little one needs and keeps him busy for hours. It is difficult to put together and took about two hours. In my opinion it was well worth it. I want to add that Mini Tots, the store outside of Amazon that was the supplier was good to work with. A part arrived damaged and they sent a replacement with no hassle 
This pool is very durable. It lasted for 2 summer seasons and is still going strong. By the time your child is about 2 years old, though, the pool will be a little small for them, so I recommend buying this pool for babies or toddlers. A bigger pool is more suitable for someone 3 or older. My daugter loves the inflatable rings that come with the pool and the detachable inflatable stars. The clearance is low enough that she can step in and out of it all by herself without a problem 
My husband and I bought this pool for our daughter when she turned one. She has been using for the past year and loves it! It is small, probably not really big enough for more than one toddler. However, if you only have one child that is going to be using it, it's perfect. I would highly recommend 
My 9 month old granddaughter loves this pool. It is the perfect size and has been a great way for her to cool off in the summer heat. I can't believe that I found the perfect pool at such a low price. It's worth every penny and more 
We took the pool to the beach and our daughter Zoe played in it all day. It's the perfect size for babies 6mo 
I was looking for something small, just so my 18 month could cool off with. This is a SMALL pool but for the price its worth it. He doesnt care for the ring toss or the dangling stars. Actually he climbs in and out but it serves its purpose. When its time to mow the grass its not to heavy to empty and hang over a chair until we are ready to use it again. I always ask people, "would you buy it again if something happened to it"?, in this case I would for this season but next year my son will be to big for it 
My son had a great time playing in this pool. I bought this item when he was 7 months old, and now he's almost 11 months old and still enjoys playing with all of the inflatable extras that the pool comes with. Every time he pelts one of the stars on the rainbow bar, the bells inside jingle--which he thinks is fabulous! The side poles that hold the colorful rings squeak when you squeeze them, so he has a good time gripping them just to hear them deflate. It's an overall safe toy that your child can enjoy as long as they are supervised, of course. The only difficulty I had was inflating the pool itself. Blowing it up would have taken forever, and using a bike pump would be a workout. Just find one of your buddies with the industrial pump in their garage or take it to the local gas station and it will take less than a minute--it's way easier 
My son is 9 months old and loves the pool whether we have water in it or not. We live in Oregon, so summer came pretty late. I blew it up and left it in the livingroom for him to play with at first. He loves the little stars with velcro and the little hoops. It's just the right size (not too small and not too big) for him 
The Rainbow Baby Pool has been a wonderful helper to us this summer with our grandchld - 10 - 11 mths. She loves the toys it came with and keeps her occupied when filled with warm water from the hose - only needs about an inch of water. I give it a very high mark 
When we aren't using this 'officially' as a pool outside, we keep it blown up and use it inside--makes for a great area to play and keep toys in. Our son loves it 
I bought this pool for an 18 month old. It is perfect! Not only does she love it, but as a caregiver, I love it, too! The whole thing inflates, so there are no sharp edges and no hard landings. The bottom is even inflated, which is great! This pool is worth the cost and then some! Even with shipping, it was a bargain! (It may be best to make sure you have some kind of pump to inflate this thing. 
Es un accesorio muy practico si tienes el videonow, por que lo puedes guardar, proteger y tiene un compartimiento para los discos. Lo unico es que el mango deberia ser mas largo para que el niño lo pueda cruzar sobre su hombro y se le haga mas facil llevarlo de un lugar a otro 
My 6 year old daughter absolutely loved this item! She left all her other toys and played with this for 4 days straight! She used it so much, I had to go back to the store and stock up on extra supplies. I found that she was more creative and used her imagination a lot more than any other toy she has. I'm a little leery of using the word "toy" in relation to the pottery wheel because it is more than that. Thank you for making such a great gift for kids. 
We were so excited to get this for Christmas. We opened it up, put it together and low and behold it was pure and utter frustration for all of us. There isn't enough power to turn the wheel. The attachments don't work. The clay will not stay on the wheel. We finally gave up. We will be sending it back to the manufacturer with a letter. DO NOT BUY 
My 11 month old daughter loves this toy. I was having a problem with her trying to stand in the tub while I was giving her a bath. Now she sits and bangs on her drum in the tub which gives me a chance to soap her up. I also use the drum instead of a cup to rinse her off. This has become a favorite bath toy in our house. : 
At first my son would bat at it and knock it over. He didn't know what to do with it but enjoyed to watch the balls bounce around, now he's mastered pushing the top and loves it 
This toy, is one of the main reasons my daughter puts up with tummy time. If she's on her tummy and starts to fuss, I can whip this out and punch the red button a few times and she's hooked. The only problem is, when she's sitting with it on the floor, she can't see the balls popping because they are down by her feet. It's a great tummy/table toy though. 
My son loves this. He likes to push the top and watch the balls jump around in there. He laughs. Very cute. 
It made me think it was a normal DVD player, whne i got it in the mail, i was supprised to find it was very very small. I should have read the PVD but i just overlooked it and thought DVD. It might be goood, ut you also have to buy all the videos. Your better off just buying a DVD player that can be used with all DVDs instead of PVDs you buy just for this, when else are you going to use a PVD 
I bought this last year for my son for Christmas. I didn't buy the PVD's until some time later, because all of the age appropriate titles or the ones he would like were sold out everywhere. (He is now 7)Anyway, by the time I finally got him some PVD's, the system, although it had been unopened until that time, did not work. Occasionally I would hear sound, but I never saw a picture. I was very disappointed and since I had purchased it quite a while before we used it, I didn't bother trying to return it. I gave in and bought a Video Now FX player today, so I am hoping that we have better results with this one 
this is a waste if you could watch the dvds it would be cool a waste of money 
this item is pretty cheap when you buy it at target or any store with good prices, but it eventually adds up to more than it is worth.Each pvd is about $8.99, but only holds 30 min. at the most! I got this toy because hasbro.com made it look so cool, but it is not worth it. I use it every now and then but my dad doesn't spend a lot of money on me and there are limits. After buying a few pvds for the player, you could have had a dvd player. Dvds are about the same price sometimes lower if it is on sale, and the hold a lot more space. You can also make dvds on the computer! You can make pvds but they hold under 20 min. I am not saying this toy is horrible. If you have a child 8 or younger, video now xp might be a good way to go. The good thing about it is on the back of each pvd, there is a now point. If you get six or more nowpoints, you get a free pvd by mail!One good point about it is that there is a long waranty. My first one didn't work very well so I got a new one. Although on the box you see two kids watching their videonow in the car, it is not a good idea unless it is a warm day. Videonow xp is sensitive to the cold and could be damaged if left in the cold too lond. Think twice before you get it. 
Es un juguete excelente, pero mi hijo de 3 1/2 años de edad no le ha hecho mucho caso, todavia. Pienso que en un tiempo mas el lo apreciara mejor. Es divertido muy entretenido y tienes la opcion de usar los discos del videonow color, jr y b/w. Por lo que hay mucha variedad 
My kids really enjoy the vidoes but they tire of the SHORT episodes quickly. It costs A LOT OF ADDITIONAL MONEY to keep up w/ videos that interest them. We have about 12 pvds and the only "Interactive" feature are trivia quizes about the show. I thought there were games or something more interactive. Overall, I wish I had bought a portable DVD player. It would have been cheaper and more interesting for them 
good thing I kept the original box... after only 2 uses, when I tried to lift up the screen I heard a click a small part came flying off (I didn't drop it or mishandled it).. one of the parts that holds the screen is cracked prevents it from opening the screen... I was able to exchanged it at TRU w/ no problem.. 
We purchased this for Christmas it is a wonderful product. We are now adding on expanding our set. The quality is what I had expected--amazing. My kids (3 6) are able to change the tracks out themselves. We did glue the bridge together w/ wood glue--that helped a lot. We all love playing with the trains! 
My 29-month grand kids (boy and girl twins) both love this wooden railway. They play with it several times a day for 2 months now. They like being able to build all sorts of railway shapes, and running the cars through them. They particularly like it when the cars go over the bridge. The set is also very easy to put away. The wood and construction appear to be of good quality 
Purchased this train set, not knowing what it was (Christmas gift request). Turns out my 3 year old grand son loves it! He can move the train along the track and it is so easy to remove or add cars to the train. We even purchased some of the other train cars since purchasing this. Thomas Friends provide him lots of chugga chugga choo choo play time 
My almost 2 1/2 year-old son is crazy for Thomas! This was his first train set and he loves it! The tracks are easy to connect for him. The only down side I would say is that the cars do tend to fall off the tracks somewhat easily. But he has no problem re-attaching the cars by their magnets and getting Thomas and friends going again. Great product, and a good price 
This set is a perfect little starter set with Thomas and two "passenger cars"--as my 3 year old son calls them. It's not so large that it takes up half the floor, and the little tunnel pleases him immensely. We added a few more "passengers" cars, another engine, and our son has spent many a half-hour chugging away in a figure eight 
Our child loves trains and really likes to watch Thomas on TV. So he right away enjoyed this toy and what was better it is all made of hard wood so it will last much longer than most toys. It should be advertised for older children perhaps 6-10 year olds but overall a good bang for the buck 
My son loves Thomas and his Friends, so this was a great present for his third birthday! After looking at various plastic Thomas train sets, we decided to invest in the Wooden Railway system. It's similar to the wooden Brio trains I had growing up. In fact, that Brio set is still in fine shape for my son to use when he visits my parents. The Thomas set has an added bonus because my son knows the engines by name from the stories we've read to him. Now he can have Thomas adventures of his own! There is no shortage of trains and tracks to add to the Wooden Railway system, so if friends or grandparents ask what my son wants for Christmas, it's easy to tell them. The set is generally well-made except that a few pieces of track fit together too tightly. I should be able to solve that with a little sandpaper. As stated on the box, the set is not for children 0-3 years old. We've confiscated the few small pieces that our one-year-old can fit completely into her mouth, such as the base for the signal flag. Also, Thomas isn't very fond of the one-year-old's teething habits as it tends to mess up his paint a little. Aside from the small quibbles, we see the set as a great investment to build on over the years and even keep for the grandkids 
My son got this set for his third birthday and he LOVES it. It's our first "real" Thomas train set (we have track from Ikea and from BJ's) and it *is* a lot nicer than the other brands. The wood track has railroad ties etched on it and the straight track flips over to reveal roadway. My son loves Thomas and this set keeps him busy for hours. My son's favorite part is that Thomas can go under the bridge (on our cheaper tracks the bridges are much lower). He also loves to move the Conductor's gate up and down to keep Thomas from passing. The trains and track in the Thomas Wooden Railway collection are durable and beautiful. My son also got the "Water Tower Steam Set" (an electric Thomas set) for his birthday but he chooses this one over that every time. It uses his imagination and keeps him involved and absorbed the way no other toy can 
My 3 year old enjoyed playing with the Thomas Friends wooden railway. He found his Christmas gift early and played with it non-stop the first day for 2 hours before bed. I'm buying the battery powered Thomas as his new Christmas gift. I recommend it highly for your young children 
I bought this as a starter set for my son on his 4th birthday. He plays with it for hours and asks me everyday if I can buy him more engines to go with it!! This is just the beginning of our Thomas collection...I recommend this to anyone wanting to start their child out with something small, but enough to keep them busy with it until you can get more to add to it 
My friend got Hoppers as a birthday present and we all played it. It was really fun and it got more challenging as we went on. What you do is: You pick a card and place the frogs on the pgs of what the picture shows on the card. Then you take one frog and jump it over one. The one that it jumped over, take it off the peg. The object it to have 1 frog remaining. It is very educational because you have to think when you play it. It is very durable because there is a pull out drawer under it that you store the frogs and the cards in. It's a great game that you can play in the car, especially for long vacations. Hoppers is hours of fun for everyone 
Binary Arts really did a good job on this peg game. I owned Rush Hour, a other great game from Binary Arts, so I thought it would be just as fun as Rush Hour but with Frogs instead of trucks and cars. It is simple to play but gets harder as the game goes on. They give you 40 cards to play with. Each card becomes harder and more challenging. To play you must move one frog at a time. You must have only one frog left on the peg board to win a game. This game is full of fun for the whole family! I recommand this game to anyone who is looking for a rainy day game or just a fun game to play with when the kids are bored 
This is a great game, that my whole family, ages 6 to 65, enjoyed on Thanksgiving 
At first Hoppers appears to be a very easy game but that is its charm. The game gets progressively more difficult and very challenging. Most of all this game is out right FUN! I simply couldn't put it down. I originally bought it for my sons birthday but I had no idea how much I was going to enjoy it too. Two big thunmbs up 
My daughter loves this Elmo, she carries it everywhere and sleeps with him. I would highly recommend this for any Elmo fan 
After months of my friends son saying all he wanted for x-mas was a huge elmo doll. I seen this item claiming to be a "large" 25" doll i agreed on spending the 60 something dollars and get it. When he opened it my friend had said it was small and looked sick. All they did was extend his legs a few inches and his belly strunk. Needless to say i was highly disappointed and had to dish out 30 something more dollars for one that was alot bigger and cheaper. So if you think that your getting your moneys worth on this doll forget it. I suggest the "large elmo soft plush doll" by fisher price. 
Bought two of these for my son and nephew for X-mas and they both loved them, also they were easy to use for both since they are both 4 years old. Great toy for the price and they will be put to good use by both kids 
Bought this and the Mater toy for my kids at Christmas. McQueen car is really really fast. Mater sometimes runs pretty slow. They are both on the same radio frequency which is not good because the kids really want to play with them at the same time. Response time for the RC is really pretty good. Otherwise the kids just love this toy 
I purchased the "Tow-Mater" and "Lightning McQueen" for my seven year old grandson for Christmas. I don't know who enjoyed it more, my grandson or my son-in-law! The only problem we found that the control for the "Tow-Mater" would also control the "Lightning McQueen" car. Which my son-in-law found amusing, but my grandson found frustrating, because Dad was controling his car too! These cars are definitely fast action. It might be hard for younger children to control the cars. I will definitely add more of the "Cars" radio controlled vehicles to my grandson's,( son-in-law's) collection 
My 6 year old informed me shortly after opening this gift on Christmas morning that it was exactly what he had asked Santa for (thank goodness since he insisted on keeping his list a secret)! We got his 3 year old brother the remote control Mator and the boys have thoroughly enjoyed both toys! I thought this was especially interesting since they have other remote control trucks, but there is something about the characters from the Cars movie that really seems to capture their imagination 
I only owned this for a few days and I'm having a blast with it. Once you start playing, it's hard to put it down. Easy to take to a friends place. Great investment for countless hours of fun. There is a slot on the back for a game key for extra puzzel games. I was not able to find any place that sells it though. Perhaps it's not out yet 
This product is a lot of fun, easy to use and easy to hook up to your t.v. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Wheel of Fortune and would like to play it at home. The game is very close to the actual game show on t 
I got this with spare money for me and my brother and my older parents. I only played it a few times, but it was worth the money. Some rounds are fun and challenging while others are fun and easy. Usually the last round, the bonus round, is the easiest. It doesn't have to be 10+. My brother was 8 and he had no problem playing with it. It's lots of fun for the whole family, ages young and old. My aunt has it too, and because she's so obsessed with wheel of fortune, she wouldn't share it with us! So we took the advantage and bought it. Boy, have the TV plug in video game people made a great hit with this! It's truly one of a kind! I also like to be childish and constantly spin the wheel on the controller even when the game hasn't been turned on :) But now, at this second, I am trying to get it on. It's not turning on...could this be the end of my game? Maybe...I might have to check the batteries. Ok? Now, I must be on my way.. 
Although I'm more hip to TV Games' 80s-era video game plug--play consoles-- and I possess just a casual interest in "Wheel of Fortune"-- I decided to give their P adaptation of the hit game show a whirl... or a spin, rather. Which is something I can actually do, thanks to the unit's built-in spinner that gets the virtual wheel of fortune rolling... a wheel complete with "Bankrupt", "Lose a Turn", as well as the usual Prize Free Spin tokens and wedges. The absence of Pat Sajak and Vannah White notwithstanding, TV Games' "Wheel of Fortune" unit is a surprisingly faithful adaptation the show, and is quite fun to play. From the three rounds of play to the final bonus round for the winner, with the buying of vowels in between, this is a lot closer to the real thing than that dopey home game the host used to palm off on the losers as consolation prizes way back when. And, just like the actual show, up to three people can play. Or you can try it out on your own, and see how many rounds you can get through before you finally run out of turns. One great feature they included in this game: the entire alphabet displayed at the bottom of the screen, with vowels in yellow and consonants in white. Just move the letter cursor left or right with the directional pad, and click the "A" button to select a letter to try out. When a certain letter has been selected, it turns gray so that you don't make the mistake of choosing that same letter later on. Another great feature this possesses is the ability to post and store the top ten high scores for each type of game and difficulty level, as well as player profiles. As for the puzzles themselves: according to the unit's display box, there are 720 different ones in all, in 35 different categories. Fortunately, in the couple dozen rounds I've played on each of the three difficulty levels (easy, medium, difficult), I've yet to get the same puzzle twice. Naturally, this limited capacity has made the "Wheel of Fortune" unit a natural fit as part of TV Games' GameKey-ready line of expandable plug--play video game consoles. Of course, if this doesn't sell all that well, they might not even bother to make a key for it. Then you'll be stuck having to solve the same 720 phrases over and over again... `Lat 
I have the whole set of this collection and who would've thought McFarlane would go with this particular concept. From the details as well as concepts as stated in the title. If you're into dispaying for the shelf for kicks as well as collecting this is it. Pretty much anything from McFarlane Toys is by far the best toy line for all ages. 
I wrote this review because I did not think this game should be rated so low. My son picks Cars to play everytime we get Vsmile out. I like it because he is able to drive a car on the road with out the difficulty of bigger systems or arcade games. He is learning while he is playing, too 
This is a good game for kids to learn from but you must be willing to help them uderstand what they are to do 
I donated these to my son's pre-school class and the kids love playing with them 
The package arrived quickly and exactly as described. Very pleased with this item and would higly recommend this vendor 
My 7 year old son has had a lot of fun with this toy. He has combined the small figures with other LEGO toys to create new games and sets. Pros: Many figures that can be used with other LEGO sets Cons: Some of the figures are repeated or have small variations. You can play with it and have fun, but you will need to combine it with other LEGO's to really enjoy it. Recommended 
I sent this to my 4year old grandson, Aidan and he was just thrilled. He was so excited after he recieved the Lego Community Workers Set that dinner was not an option that evening. Nothing could pull him away and his Mommy, my daughter thought they were so cute. 
My husband and I got this LEGO set for our 9 year old son, and he absolutely loves it. He is a LEGO nut and had been specifically looking for a LEGO people set so he can interchange the outfits, hairs, etc. to build his own LEGO characters. This set has pretty much every general "character" you can think of...from a pro-skateboarder to a firefighter. This set is also great for kids who enjoy role-play because of the various characters offered in this set. The only thing that caught us a bit off-guard was the size of the box. Based on the price we paid (around $43) we thought the box would be bigger...although there are 200 something LEGO people pieces. I guess we're just used to seeing a bigger LEGO box when we purchase a set for $40. Regardless, we all have enjoyed playing with the LEGO people 
TYPICAL LEGO SETS HAVE A FEW PIECES OF PEOPLE THAT CAN BE PUT TOGETHER, MY KIDS ALWAYS ARGUE OVER WHO GETS THEM. WITH THIS SET THEY HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH PEOPLE TO PUT THEM TOGETHER AND BUILD THEIR CITIES AND HAVE ADVENTURES 
These Legos are a great addiction for any collection. The price may be to steep but you will have to dicide for yourself 
My sons, ages 2 and 4 love the skates, especially the 4 year old. I really like that they can start at a beginner phase where the skates don't roll. It works best to start on carpet though, as tile floor can be slippery 
I love this desk for only $[...]! My son at 1.5 yrs old loves to read and color and we didn't have a small childrens table for him to sit down and do these kinds of activities (we live in a very small 2 bedroom apt in manhattan) I took my chances on ordering this desk for him, hoping it would be comfortable (the right size/length for his body and legs) We have had this desk now for 2 months and I receive so many compliments on it. My son loves to sit in it and do all activites/reading and even eating his snacks on it (crayon marks come right off with a simple wipe).!! His little legs don't yet reach the ground, but the little blue cubby below has a little lip that allows his feet to rest just perfectly! (this is also how he gets up to sit on the seat all by himself ~by stepping on the blue cubby lip). It was very easy to put together as well. The box came without the nuts and bolts by accident, but I called the company directly and they fed-ex'd the n/b the very next day! Great company and great product! I definitely give it the thumbs up 
We love all Melissa and Doug products. If you have children that love to write, draw, doodle or just stamp and be creative then this is a great toy. It has stampers, colored pencils that come in a beautiful wooden storage box 
My one year old grandson can easily play with this car. He really like the sounds and likes to see the car take off. He doesn't need help to set this car in motion 
My little cousin enjoyed the police car. Makes an appropriate amount of noise, was a good size for him to handle (3 years). No sharp edges or worries in that area. 
The Shake Police Car racer is great - my almost 5 year old son loves it. Good racing noises, and he has to use some kid energy to make it work. Even though it requires batteries, it encourages him to use his muscles to charge up the racer. About seven good shakes will get 5 full circuits on the race track. Very engaging toy 
These cars are so much fun! Just as the name says, you just shake it up and it goes. My son has several of these and they all have slightly different reactions. Some are faster than others. They work best on a hard surface - Cement, hardwood floors, tile. They go pretty slow on carpet. The cars are very durable. One of my son's favorite games is to launch them off the deck and see if he can get it to land on the grass below. If the weather isn't nice, he likes to send them racing down the stairs. So far, nothing has broken and its been over six months. These cars are easy for my daughter (who is only two) to play with too. The kids love shaking with the cars and racing to see who's car goes the farthest. 
I bought this for my 3-year-old daughter and she loves it. The box and the puzzle are made from solid wood, and the puzzles are easy to put together. There are 4 different puzzles in the box and a separate space for each of them. It's a really nice, sturdy product. 
My kids love this! Good toy for playing in the house or out, great price and the best part is that it folds up nicely to be stored out of the way. I give it only four stars because the piping that gives it its form can be a bit of a stinger on the knees. 
I ordered this item for my daughter's 1st birthday. Having my older daughter play with one of these at 18months at other kids homes, I knew that we needed one of these at our house! It's great, especially with the windows for the girls to see out and make sure mom or dad is still there. If my house was big enough I'd order another one to connect to it as well. It's really great for any age child, as long as they're crawling 
We bought this tunnel over a year ago for our then-crawling almost-one-year-old. I figured it would encourage her to crawl more, which it did--she loved it! Now she's a running, screaming, jumping, independent 2 yo who still drags this tunnel out of the back corner of the play area (where I've tried to hide it) and squeals excitedly when we pop it out for her to play in. Her older sister, who is now 3 1/2, also loves the tunnel. She copies her aunt's ideas and stands upright in the tunnel to pretend she's a monster, or hops with it around her and pretends to be a caterpillar or a frog. We don't yet have any of the tent accessories, but we build our own tents with sofa cushions and sheets, then stick one end of the tunnel in a gap, and you have a secret entrance to a special hideaway. This is one of those classic toys that children of all ages can find lots of uses for--it sparks creativity and imagination, and gives Mom a few minutes' break to go clean the kitchen. ;-) 
My 19-month-old son gets a lot of enjoyment and exercise from this tunnel. It is very sturdy, and the color is bright and attractive. The mesh "windows" add to the fun of playing hide and seek while he is crawling through. I have also recently started rolling a large ball through the tunnel, with him retrieving it at the other end. It's quicky and easy to pack up, and it packs flat, so it's easy to store. I really recommend this item, especially for winter-time when the kids can't get outside to burn off energy so much. Enjoy 
Tunnel is great for multiple kids cuz nobody is fighting over different parts. Entertains for a good long while. Folds up easily small stores out of sight. Very durable - we drag kids around the house in it - no tears 
I ordered this tunnel for my three year old and she is very excited about it. She loves playing in it. However, the main picture for the product shows two tunnels joined together, so I was expecting a longer tunnel than we got. It still provides lots of fun, just wish it was as long as it looks in the picture 
I have bought this tunnel for my three children. They seem to enjoy this toy very well. One bad thing about the toys is that it seems to be to small for all three to climb thru. This item is very durable and easy to fold and store away 
I am using this tunnel for dog agility. Now I know these are for kids but for all of us who need equipment for agility and get tired of paying hundreds of dollars, you start to look around at other solutions. This is a great durable tunnel. You can connect them together to get a long, perhaps competition sized tunnel for agility. Great price too. Would suggest weights just like any other tunnel to ensure it doesnt roll when the dog is in it or blow around too much. So even though it is for kids, dogs love it too!! 
I bought this doll for my soon to be 4 year old daughter, and she absolutely love her and take her to the shower every day, I manage to remove the head band so that she can wash and brush her head, the cushion is a little hard for her to put the doll in it, nothing that mommy can fix, my only wish is that the doll had a bit more hair since every time her hair is down you can see the scalp. Excellent choice, overall a good doll for the price 
I really wanted a baby doll my daughter (14 months)could take in the tub with her and brush/wash her hair, etc. This is ok. It serves it's purpose...somewhat. The dolls hair is up in a band which I thought could just be taken out but it is actually "sewn" into her hair/head. So she can't really wash or brush the dolls hair. The water seat it comes with is also too difficult for a child to put the doll into. Not worth the money in my opinion, I wish I would have spent the extra money and gotten her a Gotz Baby Bath Doll 
This is a perfect size doll for our 16 month old daughter. The dolls smells great too. 
We bought this for our son (7), but the whole family (ages 5 to 80) have really had fun with it. It's movements are very "life like" for a robot, and the darts fly clear across the room. We have found a few glitches where it stops working exactly as it's suppose to, but turning it off and on has fixed those so far. Overall we'd recommend it - lots of fun 
This is one of the most interesting and entertaining Remote Control items I have ever purchased. I have what I call my "Grandfathers' Toy Chest", that I purchase the toys, or relatives purchase them for me, for inclusion in my Toy Chest. (Of Course I play with all the toys before they co in the Chest to ensure their "FUN FACTOR". This way when my grandchildren come to visit the love going into my Toy Chest and playing with the best toys for many years ago. I have many of the "hot toys" furbies, R/C Plane, Helicopter and Boat as well as a R/C Dinosaur and many other toys in the Chest 
This is a cool toy. We got it for Christmas and had lots of fun with it. The darts shoot amazinlgy far. It is also easy to control unlike most remote control cars so even a 5 year old can make it go where he wants it to 
Was on our 9 year old son's Christmas wish list. Unlike many of the toys that look great in ads, this thing actually is alot of fun. Battery life is good and it moves well. Only drawback is it's pretty noisy on hard floors 
My son ONLY asked for this for Christmas, so I had to get it. It doesn't do much -- he was bored with it within a few days. It shoots the harmless "bullets" pretty far, but not easily aimed. The pincher on our first one didn't work so we had to send it back for a replacement. Pincher STILL isn't very strong basically just pushes things around rather than carry them -- it doesn't "lift" objects, just grabs them drags them around--and you have to hold a button continuously to hold the object. And LOUD -- VERY LOUD -- the legs hit the floor VERY hard (though I haven't noticed any scratches on the floor). We have a small house you can hear the bug from one end to the other. I would NOT buy this again. There are MUCH more interactive RC toys out there 
I purchased this as a gift for my grandson's 6th birthday. According to him it was the "best toy ever". It moved well on hardwood and carpeted floors. While it was exactly what a 6 year old would love, I found it to be very noisy. Other than that, be prepared to precharge it. I takes several hours for the first charge 
My five-and-a-half year old daughter loves her GigaPet. It's easy enough for her to play, with a little help with reading some of the words and "shopping" at the virtual stores. It keeps her entertained for a while, while teaching her to read and/or recognize some words and phrases. It's cute, but not too high-maintenance, since you can't kill it, and can just bring it to the pet school to have all its needs taken care of 
I got 5 different ones plus the tv thing for our kids. (Yes, I have six kids.) It's not even a week after xmas and none of them will play with it. To much work. You spent the better part of an hour digging for various items, money being the most important and then have to take your money to the store to buy things,like FOOD, feed the pet just to have the pet still be hungry. What a pain the the behind!! Even the oldest won't do it!! And I'm an adult! We are taking ours back for a full refund 
I got this game to play with 5 other people during spring break, and we definitely all had a good time playing it. We split into two teams, guys vs. girls. It wasn't stupid hard like the "Friends Scene it" version was. It was a little challenging, but we definitely knew a lot of answers. Without a doubt a great party game. If you've got a lot of people both guys and girls, you can't go wrong playing this! This is my first board game review, but I give it 4 stars. 
My kids love being read to by Teddy Ruxpen, this book is a continuation to the books that came with him. My only complaint is that I feel the books are a little overpriced, but my kids really like them and get a lot of time out of them, they like to read them over and over again, so I guess it is a good value 
i love animals and lps toys. They are soooo fun. I recomend this toy to everyone. You can slide them down the chute and run them on the hamster wheel then give them a drink of water from the water bottle or you can make a comfy bed with the wood chips. They are so cool i have 15 and are getting more this saturday they are sooooo cool. : 
I ASKED MY PARENTS IF I COULD GET A PET HAMSTER, BUT THEY SAID NO. I GOT THESE SO I COULD HAVE HAMSTERS AND POSSIBLY SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO HAVE A HAMSTER. I NAMED ALL OF THEM. BEFORE I DID ONE OF MY FRIENDS NAMED THEM. I BROUGHT THEM TO MIDDLE SCHOOL IN MY PURSE. THEY HAVE MAGNETS IN THEM SO THEY STUCK TO MY DESK. EVERYONE WAS ASKING ME FOR THEM. MY FRIENDS SAID THEY WANTED TO COLLECT THEM. THEIR HEADS DONT BOBBLE THAT MUCH, BUT THEY ARE SUPER CUTE. THEIR PLAYSET IS COOL AND IT ONLY COST $8 AT THE STORE. PLEASE GET THESE HAMSTERS. THEY ARE A MAJOR MUST HAVE!!! 
I got this playset on Monday, and ever since I got this, I haven't put it down! This is almost as good as the playhouse! This toy is very educational, because you can look after the little hamsters and you can feed them lots of food and make them a nice cozy warm bed, and you can let them have fun and slide down the slide! Or they can work out in the little spinning weel! They can do lots of activities before bedtime! This playset is LOADS of fun for boys and girls and collectors. Perfect for any hamster lovin' kid! So these hamsters are looking for a nice warm cozy and lovely home, and I bet I know where that is.....at your house and with you! I know I look after my little pets well, and I know how to look after animals, I watch lots of animal shows, and I especially know how to look after cats, I had a beautiful black and white cat called Mayhem, she caused mayhem! My mom had her when she was a kitten way before I was born, when I was little like, 5 or 6 she died. Now I have 2 cats, 1 is a boy and he's a black cat, and I have a girl, she's a tabby. I love cats, I love all animals. Enough about that, this playset is sooo cute, I know that tons of kids will love these little pets 
They are SO CUTE! I like everything about them! I really like how they come with the "wood chips" and how the water bottle bottle is almost all the way clear so it looks like there is "water" in the bottle. My real hamster recently died,"sigh", so I really liked gettling these because they are a good memory. P.s. They are SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I bought this for my nephews 2nd birthday and he loved it. He learned quickly how to change the song and start it over. He dances and sings forever on his Wiggles mat. Terrific gift for little ones with lots of energy! 
This is a fun toy but not a dance mat as previously posted which was a bit of a disappointed as my little one loves to dance. Wish I would have read the reviews first 
My daughter received this for her 2nd birthday. I was unaware of the 4+ age disclaimer when we opened it, but I have no worries about it's safety. My daughter LOVES it... every child, wiggles fan or not, who comes over LOVES it... I believe it IS Greg's voice singing... we have had no issues... I will say that I wish they did entire songs, but the kids don't seem bothered by it, so why should I? It's fabulous 
This toy was given to my first son who was a wiggles fan. It was passed on to his younger brother who is a big fan as well. They both love it. My one year old could care a less that the songs start over everytime he moves. He just loves to hear them sing and is on it everytime you turn around. I also don't think it is all that loud as other reviewers have said. Overall, I think it is a great toy! 
I would have to disagree with other posters I think it is Greg singing.. I also don't think it is that loud.. We Love it just the way it is. Well minus the ONE flaw.. If it is to be used as a "DANCE MAT" one would assume your child could dance on it.. NOT really the case unless you want to hear songs start over and over again or new ones startin everytime they move. Whenever they jump and hit the mat again the songs start over.. That to me is irritating. We try to make a game out of it. We tell them which characted to "squish" and then they jump to the side and dance around it.. It is a GREAT Travel toy. We got ours as a Christmas gift Last Year and it has been to FL twice and to nana's house a few times too.. It folds up like a blanket and you can just shove it wherever and the cords (or whatever is making it work inside) never mess up.. My boys are always jumping on it and pressing the different characters and I have only changed the batteries ONCE. We have had it OVER A YEAR! So that too is impressive. 
There's just nothing special about this toy. We love the Wiggles in this house - and this toy is OK - but it's better to just buy a CD with their songs on it and play it. These songs keep starting over or switching when you step on a different picture, and it becomes very annoying. But, I will add- my 20 month old does seem to enjoy it. 
My two year olds dont even like this toy. They love the wiggles, they do point to the characters and say their names - but to PLAY on it. Not possible. The songs mumble jumble all over each other as the kids move on the matt. Its a very loud speaker and even I cannot take it (Im very liberal w/ loud toys and banging, etc) There is not an ounce of fun in this toy, im very disappointed as most of the other wiggles toys have been great. Dont spend your money on this one. OR keep your receipt handy. 
Great overall toy! My kids love it! 
This leappad excercise is really worth the price, since it hooks the kids right from the cover and later in content. With super hit movie already caught kids imagination, this leappad will not stress the kids and they keep revisiting the excecises and recollect the sequences from movie. I recommend it 
I love Leap Pad, but there is a catch. We've bought 3 pads (the first one broke almost immediately), and we've owned about 10 different books. Of those 10, only 3 still work. One got wet. Several were placed in toy boxes or kicked under beds. Once these books have been dropped a few times, or buried under toys, they cease to work correctly (if at all). They ARE only cardboard, after all. The children who will get the most benefit and fun from these toys are young - say kindergarten through 3rd grade. Older kids are going to be less satisfied with the format, and will probably be happier working on an actual computer. Leap pad is particularly great for long car trips, but make sure the little game cartridges don't go missing. Also, the wire connecting the stylus to the pad can become caught when the pad is shut - and once that wire is ruined the pad is ruined too. As I said, I think leap pad items are great. They can help a child with reading, spelling, basic math - all in a fun and stress-free venue. But these books are easily ruined by little ones. Your best bet may be to keep the leap pad books and pad out of reach of the kids when you can't be there to supervise, so that you can oversee the care and handling of the books and pad. Leap pad is a good value, but only if you can make it last a while 
while this is a cute game, it is a little hard to get the pieces to snap together. 
This is a wonderful toy for learning many beginning math concepts. At first glance you don't realize how much learning these little gingerbread people can inspire. There are a multitude of ways to sort and pattern with these. I bought them for my 2 1/2 year old, but my 7 year old loves them just as much. There is a short learning guide that comes with them with some great ideas for other activities. I worked with my youngest for about 15 minutes with these and in that amount of time we sorted them about 4 different ways, counted different sets and patterned. As a teacher and a mother, these should be in every child's playroom! I even bought a set for my morning kdg. class 
I got this for my two-year old, and she loves it...the colors are bright and the game itself encourages strategizing, and creativity in figuring out the different ways one can balance the blocks. Its great for family time too, and is heartening to see creative games like these instead of the usual tech toys 
This game is easy to play and can be adapted for different ages. It's fun to see 4 year olds strategize 
Great for toddlers through young children. My son loves animals so he really loves these blocks. Great non-electronic game for kids 
My three and a half year old son loves this toy. Each time we play the game is different. He likes to find the correct elephants and stack them. He's learning how to build the tower so that it stays balanced. His eight year old sister enjoys the game as well. We purchased extras to give as gifts 
A well-designed wooden box holds 4 puzzles for your toddler. If he or she has a small fit and throws them in the air, never fear, they are coded on the back for categorizing the pieces by puzzle. Made of good quality materials, and the pictures are great 
I bought this for my 3-year-old. She loves it. It's solid wood and great quality. Makes a great gift. 
This item looks ok, but the website was COMPLETELY misleading in saying that it ships within 24 hours. I ordered this on Nov. 27th and did not receive it til Dec. 8th. That's nearly 2 weeks. It may not be worth ordering online even with the free shipping, better to fight the crowds at the stores 
Terence is my two year old son's favorite train from the the Thomas books. We bought him the wooden Terence from a local toy store, only to discover that his treads came off about thirty seconds after he came out of the box. This was a real pain - I put the treads away and let my son use Terence like a regular train, which he didn't mind too much but it was a bit upsetting to pay ten dollars for a toy and then have it be poor in quality. A few days later, we were at a different toy store and saw that Terence had been redesigned! Unfortunately, the store we had bought him from doesn't do refunds, only exchanges. I went home and called Learning Curve's 800 number, and a very nice customer service lady gave me an address and told me that they would replace my son's Terence with the new one. I mailed him back, got the new one in a few weeks, and he's GREAT. The treads don't come off, he rolls on plain table, track, and even the carpet wonderfully. My son was very happy as he had wondered what happened to his old Terence. Learning Curve has a lifetime garuntee on all their products so if you have the old Terence I reccommend giving them a call and they will let you exchange it for a new one (even if you bought it three years ago!) 
Terrence is probably not made for the track - since he is a tractor and is meant to be used in fields, or for plowing snow. That said, this little guy goes about everywhere in our house and we haven't had any trouble with the tire treads. If your child is prone to pick at such things like mine is, just to see if he can get them off, then I suggest maybe advising otherwise. My little one figured out how to get them off very quickly, but became aggravated that they were not on when he was "plowing the field." So, I put them back on and well, they haven't come off since. Some neat role playing occurs with Terrence. He just opens new doors for working outside of the track and especially with all the new construction guys that have been introduced lately like Alfie and Jack. Terrence has a lot of fun in our house and he comes highly recommended 
I have the new designed model and the treads don't come off. He is not a train and is not meant to run on the track, the road maybe, but more for "off-road". My son likes him, just get the newly designed type 
Well when we purchased this toy we had read the reviews here and expected the treads to come off all the time. Well, lo and behold our version of terence doesn't do this. They've redesigned him and the treads do not come off. He fits on the track but does not roll like the other trains. Pressure has to be applied and his wheels will turn but he can in no way roll down a hill on his own. You could cut the treads but the wheels don't appear to be the right size. Sometimes the treads get off their wheel grooves a bit and they seem like they may stretch out. Our son still loves "Terdence" but I would almost prefer having the old style so we could remove the treads and he would roll freely. Messes up the track too if it's not secure. The store had both versions I now know and may buy the other one. Difficult to make everyone happy I realize, Dad probably is more concerned about it than his son : 
I purchased this for my 3 year old son and no sooner than we had taken him out of the box and ran it on the table the treads came off. I am constantly looking for the treads, or fixing them. All the other Thomas toys we have are great, but Terrance doesn't seem as durable as the others, thus making this toy in my opinion a flop 
It's a great learning device/game for kids! But if you have the money buy the one that uses all of the cartridges/books or you'll spend a lot of money upgrading 
We got this for our daughter's seventh birthday and she loves it and uses it all the time 
I love this toy becuase it is very educational. I never had problems with it at all. It definitly durable. I play with it all the tim 
I bought this about a year or so ago for my daughter--she still "plays" with it regularly. The quantum pad books are targeted for older kids but my younger children also enjoy playing with them. My daughter has about 8 quantum books, and enjoys every single one of them. My *main* concern was when I was deciding to purchase this or not was: -durability (it's well made) -diversity of books and contents (lots of books to choose from, it does take the regular leap pad books too. Also, lots of different interesting facts on the books--not boring at all.) -battery consumption (no problem there either--I've only had to change it once--maybe twice--in the past year) After I bought this, I bought 'my first leappad' for my youngest...and he enjoys it so much. Right now I'm searching for a good deal on the "Leappad plus writing" (possibly the one 'with microphone')--that's how much I like the leappad 'system'--the children get hours and hours of fun and learning. The price is worth it, in my opinion... :0) --actually, you can even find my husband and/or me playing with this too :0) --my only gripe with this system is the quantum pad bag (sold separately)--it doesn't hold a lot of books (it's made for 4 book and 4 cartridge)--but my daughter squeezed all 8 in hers :0) 
The book is supposed to be great...so long as you can find accessories to it. And that is a hassle--no books for kindergardeners to find anywhere [...] What was the point of spending [...] to purchase the station if there are no books to use it with? 
I got this toy when I was in 3rd Grade. I played it like crazy during my summmer vacation. I came home and lost it. Then 2 years later I find it and I'm already in 5th grade.Its still fun,but I need to buy new books for it and in one year i'll lose it again and forget about and buy the time I find it I won't play with it any more. The Quantun Pad is a great toy,but dont lose it and buy it when your younger 
This toy is not safe for other children, the batteries keep running out every time i play for 20 minutes how rude. That's why i don't play my leadpay no more cause mommy saids i'm to busy honey i can't go out and buy some sorry. Where ever I touch the leapad said something wrong and wrost of all I get something right it saids its wrong and once you play for like 5 days it bores you already.... stop selling this!!!!!!!! but its kind of fun once you learn something you never knew and it talk so this is not to boring. This should be in schools why no 
I got this toy when I was 8 and now 3 years later I still love it the only thing bad about it is that they don't make books for older kids. the durability is great i've dropped it tons of times and it hasn't broke yet.this toy is great 
My kids love this and just like the other reviewers said, they NEVER tire of it. This is well worth the price 
It's a very good geometric toy. No sharp edges. And you can buy more cards at learningresources.com. I wish they were available at Toys R Us 
We received this toy for a gift for my 3-1/2 year old, and he loves it! He loves puzzles, and immediately figured out how to manipulate the pieces to fit the diagrams He never tires of it, although he'll occasionally get frustrated if the pieces slide out of place on the diagram. The pieces are very well made with no sharp edges. My only complaint is that it only comes with 4 patterns, and the cardboard "form" isn't very durable. Excellent choice overall, though 
My husband is a huge horror film junkie. I saw this item and decided to purchase it for my husband's birthday. I have never ordered from Amazon, but decide to try it. The item arrived today and it is better than I thought it would be. I am very happy and will order from the seller many more times. Thanks 
This 18inch figure with theme song and breathing sound is awsome.This is great to my collection of toys.The mask was great it looked like from the movie,the one covered in blood was wrong beacuse michal is never covered in blood.If you love the movies than buy this toy! 
I got this figure for Christmas! One of the best ones I got! An awesome 18 inch figure that is well detailed. The sensor that sounds the music off is great! A must have 
My Daughter loved it, she play's with it everyday and her friends also have one and they can connect them. Its good clean fun for kids. 
It's amazing how Bandai can create such fun toys! Hey there! If you want to buy a Tamagotchi v4, but yet, you aren't sure? GET IT! If you are a Tama - holic like me, you know what it's like to have a tamagotchi. A tamagotchi is like a portable almost lifelike keychain pet. You feed it, train it, punish it, clean up after it and exercise it. Long story short, you keep it alive :P. And now, with the new V4, you can even turn it in to school! The higher your training points are, the better character you can get. Breed tamagotchi with your friends, and have loads of other fun things. With Tamagotchi, you never know what's gonna happen next.. 
I love this littlest pet shop! It comes with a really cute Sheepdog with an adorable flower in it's fur, it has three magnets to hold on securely, and a REALLY big bed. The things that makes me mad is that it's head always tipps back, and it will only drink the bottle if it's in it's bed. Otherwise, i love it! 
My 2 1/2 year old loves the original Winnie The Pooh movie. This book is an abridged section of this movie. My little boy can sit through each page, listen to the stories, and touch everything to make sure he does not miss any sounds. He loves every page in the book. He is not a fan of any of the books with Leap, except the story in the book that came with the Leap Pad. If your child likes Pooh or the Pooh movie, then this book is a must 
This one has a rather sad story where tigger gets into trouble with bouncing, ending up stuck in a tree with baby roo. The story ends with rabbit gloating over him and wanting him to stop bouncing for ever after tigger is rescued. So, my 2 year old never wants to finish reading this story, its just too too sad! He likes the pooh bear story much better! Not too mqny activities and games either on each pag 
Even Bob's many building talents could not deal with this problem. We could not be more disappointed. Like the previous reviews say, it falls apart constantly. You cannot play with one area without having your child ask you to fix some other part that has just collapsed or doesn't fit properly. This was a waste of money. I expected better given that the actual character vehicles are a lot hardier and can withstand alot more play 
This toy has inspired me to write my first review. If I could have rated this a "0" I would have done so. It's absolutely horrible. Learning Curve should be ashamed of the extrememly poor workmanship on this toy. What makes it all the more frustrating is that my grandson loves the concept and wants to play with the toy - but even at 5 years of age he is unable to manage all of the problems. For goodness sakes, Bob himself couldn't handle this project! Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. Also, as noted in an earlier review - the chainsaw deal has all the same problems so don't buy it either. Very disappointing 
Plastic toolbox, falls apart real easily, can't even pick it up in one piece. Son still likes to play with it though. 
My 2-year-old received this for his birthday....what a huge disappointment to him. Looks fun, but nothing stays together long enough to play with it. One piece gets put on, another falls off. I was going to return it but with so many loose pieces, we lost a few before being able to take it back. Manufacturers should not put junk like this out there, disappointing kids and taking people's money. 
My youngest son is an avid Bob the Builder fan and that was the gift theme for him last Christmas. We bought this and the chainsaw set and they were both a waste of money. This particular set falls apart easily and folding it up to put away is near impossible. Nothing aligns properly and the spare pieces fall out the entire time your trying to wrestle it shut. The die cast vehicles are too heavy to use with this toy and after attemping to play with it a few times, our kids gave up. The track snaps togther well, but that it the only part of this product that was useable 
I wish there were reviews on this toy two month ago. My son and his friends love this toys, but it is too easily break apart. It is cheaply made, and definetily waste of my money 
I just had to add my review!....I want to make sure people know this toy is a piece of junk. Nothing about this stays together! I'm annoyed with putting it all back together. It will soon go to never never toyland. This is probably one of the worst toys my kids have ever gotten. My daughter is 4 and she can't even get the toy to stay together. It's just ridiculous! Meanwhile, my poor 2yr old son just cries because he wants lofty to go over the bridge but the bridge won't even stay up!....gggggrrrr Oh and finally i put one star only because zero was not an option 
I agree with the complaints already written about the toy falling apart easily. Also, the sounds are really annoying and they get set off very easily. I was just about to make the batteries "die" when three of the screws became loose and we had to take the toy away until we could fix it. We looked everywhere for a screwdriver w/ a triangle shape to tighten them back into place, but haven't been able to find one. Although my son has been asking frequently if the toolbox is fixed, he really has been having as much fun just using the diecast vehicles by themselves 
This is a great product. I love Melissa Doug items. They are made so well. This was purchased for my 3 year old on her birthday. She loves this and so does her 7 year old brother! It was one of the items the kids at the party played with 
For all ages. We had so much fun with these over the holidays. Everyone can play. 
My 8 yr old son got this for Christmas and he played it non-stop!! We were looking for a fast paced game that his friends could play too. He is very smart and can play games designed for 12 yr olds and up but it is hard for his friends to play with him. This is great and can be played in the hour window of time my 2 yr old takes a nap 
I bought my two year-old son all 5 of these for his birthday, but since he normally doesn't play with stuffed animals I wasn't sure he'd become too attached to them. But he loves them! He gathers them all up and gets upset if any are missing, since he knows them all by name. They are so cute and very well made. I definitely recommend them 
I bought this little guy as an afterthought to another purchase and was surprised by the size, I'm guessing around 8" and the quality of the toy. As a grandmother, I had not heard of the Backyardians, but my 4yr old grandaughter was thoroughly delighted and very familar with the whole colorful gang. A nice solid toy, well made 
What can I say ... he's cute. My son wanted the Dancing Pablo .. I felt he was to old for it .. so I gave him this one. He's soft. 
I bought 4 of them for our 2 year old daughter, because Tasha was not in stock. They are really beutiful, very well finished, nice colors, excellent quality and exactly the same with the ones on the TV. Our daughter loves them, she sleeps with the four of them every night. I would strongly recomend buying them if your kid likes the backyardignas TV show 
Bought it for my boy when he was 2.5. Now, 3 year and one month. He know all the state names, capital and where exactly it is (other than the eastern state where they have 3 states together). Nice puzzle...definitely worth the mone 
We bought this for our 5 yr old daughter, and she's taken it apart a million times. She's learned all 50 states using this map puzzle. Her 2 yr old brother would sit on the floor and watch her. After about a month, he could put it together by himself. Since he's speech impaired, we've used the pictures on the pcs as a way to get him to say various things. He now identifying many items and his therapist is really happy that we've integrated this puzzle into his speech therapy 
I purchased this as a Christmas present for great-grandchildren in Japan. They will be moving to the U.S. next year, and I hope this will help them learn about their new country. Their father is a U.S.Navy officer, and mother is Japanese. This looked sturdy and easy for small children to handle. 
I bought these for my daughter and her cousins for Christmas this year. I was very impressed with the quality of these maps/puzzles, and the back side of the puzzle lists all the trivia and info for each state. Overall, a great way to learn states and capitals 
My 79 year old father has dementia and is in a nursing home. I bought this puzzle to help his memory and hand/eye co-ordination. He and my mother traveled alot and when we work with the puzzle, he can remember some of the places that they visited. He can recall many adventures and this helps keep his mind active. Many of the other residents also enjoy talking about their travels. Most of the pieces are large enough for them to handle and because they are made of wood, they don't bend or get lost. Thank you. 
I bought this for my nephew at 2 1/2 years of age. Do you know that he could say the state of Texas, and recognize the little pieces like New York, Vermont, etc. just because of this puzzle. It is very appealing to toddlers 
This is a must have for any youngster (ages 5 or 6 to 8 or 9 in my opinion) who has any interest in puzzles. It is sturdy, simple to use and with very little efffort teaches the child the location and highlights of each state in our amazing country. It also allows the child to discover where relatives and friends are located in relation to their home state. As a former teacher, I feel it would be an asset to any primary classroom as well 
I ordered this U.S. puzzle to keep at my house to use when my five grandchildren come over. We work on a few of the states each time they come. It's nice because under each piece is the capitol of the state so it can be used to learn those or just the state locations. I have found it quite useful, and the kids look forward to our little "game" 
Great way to learn the states and capitals. I wish they made a world map puzzle like this 
This is a great game, brings back memories, makes me want to get the 80's gam 
For those of us who grew up in the coolest decade ever, this board game puts you in the TIME MACHINE and brings you back. It is a game of knowledge and fun. I think it is a must have for everyone 
I used the cards to make a trivia contest for my 50th birthday. For this purpose, the game was fine. 
If you love the 70's you will love this game. I can not wait till the next time we play 
you've got to get this game -- having spent the majority of my twenties living in the decade that brought us disco, this game really brought us back in time. the questions were really challenging, interesting and the best thing about is that there are so many questions that i'm sure we'll enjoy this game for quite a while. i would recommend this game to anyone who grew up in the 70's or anyone who is just plain nostalgic of this magicial decade. now that i found it, i think it might be showing up under a few trees of my friends and family this season! enjoy 
I had some old high school friends over for dinner and wine. I had found the 70's game the week before and thought it would be a perfect after dinner activity. We all loved it and were surprised at how much we could remember!!! We've decided to have our next dinner party be a 70's theme and dress accordingly and play the game again 
If you like trivia games and you are a fan of the 70's, this game is pure genius! Since I suck at pop culture, this game made me feel incredibly stoopid--but even total morons like me can totally enjoy the game. The best is the music category--the questions will have you singing the tunes all night long... Get it done--whatever it takes 
I can't think of a better toy. There are a gazillion ways to use this toy, from pre-walking through kindergarten. It's a set of blocks, a bead maze, a walker, a pretend lawn mower, a pretend shopping cart, a pretend car, a pretend doll stroller, a step-stool, a storage chest.... And it has wheels and lids, which are the best inventions on earth as far as our 15-mo is concerned. If you have hardwood floors, I recommend a quick fix to slow the cart down for pre-walkers... With our hardwood floors, this Walker rolled too fast for our pre-walker to control. So, I super-glued foam-rubber KidKushions** onto the corners of the back edge. The KidKushions (sold as babyproofing supplies) drag along the floor just enough to slow the cart down. [...] Now that our guy is walking pretty well, he still loves this toy. I recently used some bicycle-chain lubricant on the wheels so that they would stop squeaking so much. However, I'm not sure I'd recommend doing that if you still have a pre-walker. The wheel friction also helped to slow the cart down a bit 
We bought this walker for our daughter's first birthday and she absolutely loves it. She plays with it all the time and is really proud of herself for learning to walk with it. She just beams when she is using it. The solid wood construction makes it very durable. Its tip-proof design makes it safe too. My daughter can pull to a standing without the walker falling over. She even climbs on the front of it and it still does not tip. Did I mention how cute it is too? Reminds me of those good old fashion wood toys but kicked up a notch. Can't say enough good things about this walker. One of the best toy purchases we have made yet. 
This is a wonderful toy. We bought it for our 8 month old who was starting to pull herself up on everything. She loves it and plays with it everyday. It's very well made and is good and sturdy. The only thing I would say negatively is that on hardwood floors it moves quickly so you need to make sure that you're always right by your little one when they decide to take it for a spin. I'm sure once she's fully able to walk that this won't be an issue but for now it's a slight concern. Other than that I would highly recommend this product 
This is a quality toy that is well made and veristile. My 8 month old loves to use it to climb on, open and close the doors, and stand up. I can see how this will be a much loved toy in a month, year, years!! 
It is much sturdier and much better than I could imagine with plenty of blocks 
This toy was one of the cutest and best put together toy we have ever gotten for our children. There are rubber grips so the toy cannot be pulled back on to the child when walking behind it. The blocks are solid and very well made 
I bought this for my daughter when she was 7 months old. She is now 4. She and her younger sister still play with this often. I have a toy chest full of many toys. This is the only toy that I have purchased that has been used for so long and so often. It's great!! There are 3 types of blocks. Some that are fabric that are best for the 6-18 month age group. There are rubber like blocks that are best fro 9-24 months. Then there are the wooden blocks with lots of pictures. My kids still stack the blocks and view the pictures on the wooden blocks. My 4 year old loves to build stuff with the wooden blocks. The walker/cart was used as a walker and now is used as a stepping stool. I recently purchased this for my nephew who is 12 months old and he loves it. His parents doubted that there would be another toy he receives that will be used as much as this Block Walker. This is an A+++++ toy! If I could only buy one toy for my kids it would be this Around the Block Walker 
We bought this toy for our daughter for her first birthday. She absolutely loves it! It helped teach her to walk and I love that it doesn't tip over like the plastic walkers do. We have so much fun with the blocks as well. This is a really great purchase 
I own both decks. As a collector the stucure decks give me two things I want most. One 52 cards for ten dollors. Two several rare and ultra rare cards without paying out large amounts of money. Buying Dragons Roar or Zombie Madness, is a good investment. The structure decks are great for people who want cards, yet don't want to break the bank. 
This deck is pretty good if you can get a lot of the cards on the Dueling Guide.I do have every structure deck.I've got cards like 'Armed dragon LV7','Horus the black flame dragon LV8',etc. Just try to get as much power cards as you can 
ive been thinkin on wat deck i should get because my bros have the fire deck and the fury from the deep so im choosing between the dark one and dragon roar i would like to know how much these decks are because i only have ten dollars so help out please 
i took the time to decide what deck or decks i should spend my ten dolars on.that fire deck, fury from the deep, dragon's roar or zombie maddness.i went every where to every website to find out, i led my self to this. i am extra happy because today is hallowee 
These chairs were very easy to put together and are the perfect size for my three-year-old and sturdy enough for adults to sit on, too. They look great with the other Mission-style furniture we have in our art room 
Chairs are wonderful. They went together easy. Electric screwdriver is a lifesaver. Sturdy construction will last forever. 
I bought a pair of these when my daughter was 1 and had to climb up onto them. Now she's 2 1/2 and they fit her perfectly, yet are certainly strong enough to hold a parent who wants to sit down with their child. I disagree that they were easy to put together, but probably that is because all I had was a manual screwdriver and by the time you have screwed two-dozen or so screws into wood, it gets painful! Also, they might seem expensive, but the quality is worth it. These chairs will last for generations! I wish Amazon had carried them when I purchased mine. I paid about $20 more than their price and at that time that was the best price I could find 
We bought these chairs to go with the Little Tikes Mission Design wood table. Not only are they are perfect match (they are, after all, from the same collection), but they are sturdy, well made and beautiful. The light natural wood coloring coordinates well with our furniture and this table and chair set can be used anywhere in the house without fear of staining the table or chairs. There is a light coating of finish that is virtually impenetrable and allows for easy clean up. My nearly 3 year old daughter, who is 38 inches tall, has no trouble fitting under the table in these chairs. She loves this set and so do I! It was super easy to assemble (I did it myself in less than 30 minutes). The chairs are sturdy and durable, yet light enough for my daughter to be able to move them with ease. I would buy these again in a heartbeat and would recommend them to anyone who is in the market for a great table and chairs set! 
See my review about the table that matches this. This set is great for the smaller child/toddler. It is incredibly sturdy. I don't know what they are talking about "small parts, not for children under 3", I mean it's a CHAIR, there are no parts that come off! My very tall two-year-old toddler LOVES this chair. Other furniture (PBK) is too tall. this is perfect 
Great way to carry around a leappad and a few books and cartridges. Paid around $7 for it on clearance at a store a few years ago 
lots of space in this backpack, I can fit two leapPads along with 10-12 books cassettes. great storage item, very sturdy 
This item was very useful when traveling with my five year old. She was able to take her LeapPad and numerous books with her...never getting bored. It is a great way to be and stay organized 
My child's leappad came with this backpack... and thank goodness it did! The nifty little mesh compartments for the cartridges allow you to see which one is in there, and it keeps all of the books tidy and organized. My only concern is there are only 4 compartments for the cartridges... and we have alot more books 
I recently purchased this backpack for my grandson. He just turned 4 and he will now put away his leappad items instead of leaving them scattered about on the floor. It is also great to have because it is all contained in one pack. He now takes it in the car when we visit and he hangs it on his door knob and it will now stay in tact. Excellent buy 
The backpack has places for the cartridges which would otherwise be easily lost. Worth the investment 
My 4 year old was always loosing her cartridges and now she knows right where they are!! We love it 
This back pack is just right for storing approximately five books and cartridges for the Leap Pad (we use one for our My First Leap Pad and the older kids use one for their Writing Leap Pad); it's great for keeping it all together and organized perfectly so, the kids can easily find the cartridge and book that go together. 
The bag didn't hold everything, hard for my 4 year old to put the Leap Pad in 
I bought this for my children for a new bathtub toy. They have only used a few times, but enjoy it. The only thing I don't care for is that it's hard to get all the water out of the "reel" part of the fishing rod. The large fish are also just fun to play with in the tub 
The product was good but we found it elsewhere alot cheaper. It did save us the trip to the store so I won't complain 
I have a two-year old and she is in love with this keyboard! When we first received the product she was a bit overwhelmed at first. But after an hour or so she was fine. The microphone is a bit too loud for my taste. I put a piece of tape over it to lessen the sound/reverb. 
The Magic Music Maker Keyboard was a good choice for my grandson, aged 3. He seems to enjoy it, while it stimulates his interest in music. 
My 6 year old daughter received this as a gift from Santa and she loves it. This is a nice compromise between the cheap keyboards that sound bad and break easily and the spendy ones that are a bit too advanced for young children 
This is very nice, my kids (ages 2 and 6) love it. The only issue I have is that the microphone is too close to the speaker and it creates that lovely high pitched sound. Once I showed my daughter how to hold the microphone when she wanted to use it, we cut out some of the noise. Other than that, great item for kids to play with, dance to, and explore with 
This toy is a hit with everyone that comes into contact with it. It has so many options that it will keep your child and possibly your husband distracted for quite some time! Totally worth the purchase 
Jackie hits a home run here! Any preteen boy will love the stuff this mach ine spits out 
We bought these along with the 12 pc. set of large blocks. My 4 yr.old grandson loves them. They are of good quality and sturdy. He will spend hours building, towers, garages, etc. pretending it's a neighborhood. 
The best toys are open-ended, to let kids use their imaginations when they play with them, and these blocks are just the ticket. I had these blocks as a child, my daughter had a set when she was little, I use them in the classrooms at my child development center, and now my nephew is enjoying his set. There are enough in the set to let kids build really big structures - a fort large enough to hide in, a very tall wall, etc. If you can only get a kid one gift, this is a great one to choose 
I purchased these blocks for my one year-old grandchild, whom I watch everyday during the week. He LOVED them! Actually, all of my grandkids from ages 1 through 8 had a blast playing with these blocks when they came over for Christmas. I ordered the 12-piece set of jumbo blocks to supplement the 40 piece basic set. I highly recommend getting both sets so that your kids have enough pieces in all sizes. 
My son had these same blocks when he was little and they never wore out, I was amazed that these same blocks were still available for purchase. My son who is 30 was even excited when they came in the mail. These blocks are the most incredibly strong toy to be made out of cardboard that it is unbelievable! I would definitely recommend these blocks for your little one, my son played with his for 10 years and they never broke and to tell you the truth at 30 i think he may still be playing with them 
My almost 2 yr old grandson loves them. Had one damaged block, called the 800 number for Melissa Doug and they sent me an entire package of new blocks in the size that the one was damaged. Would and have bought from them again again 
I bought this for my son's preschool class. The children play with these all the time. It was a great find 
I bought this for my daughter's fourth birthday because I remembered similar big red blocks from my own kindergarten years. It has been her favorite present. She has built towers, beds for her stuffed animals, hurdles, set up a restaurant table and chairs for her dolls, and more. It's a classic toy, great for creative play. I do wish it had more of the big red blocks; the vast majority are the small yellow ones. And you do have to assemble the blocks, which is not too difficult if you have two people to do it. It really takes more than two hands 
Great for storing all your Barbie needs. Say goodbye to all those little cases that only hold 2 or 3 dolls. This is a great product 
This is a nice bin to put all the barbies and their accessories. My 3 year old has had it just over a month, but it's holding up very well so far. It holds alot, so clean up is great! Good product overall 
Bought this Barbie case for my daughter and am disappointed with it. There is nothing on it at all that says or shows Barbie, it is just blah pink. The handle fell off the first day and got lost. Inside, it is very deep and has slots for the barbies to stand up in and then just a deep wasted space. No way to organize the clothes at all. The top has very shallow compartments to keep small stuff in... but they are hard for little hands to open. We just don't like it and my daughter doesn't play with it at all. An expensive mistake. : 
We bought this for our 3 1/2 year old daughter to store an assortment of Barbie items we inherited. The divided lid is great for tiny objects like shoes, perfume bottles etc. and stays closed surprisingly well even while it is being slammed open and shut to reach the items inside the case. The case stores Barbies upright which keeps hair from getting tangled etc. The clear case is great for seeing what is inside and the wheels and handle are convenient for our daughter. We weren't sure what to expect as far as quality, but for a plastic case and the money we paid, we think it is a great buy 
Yeah, it is your standard cheapo type of construction that one is accustomed to with Barbie/Mattel products, plastic is flimsy and ours (we snagged the only 2 left at Target, one for my daughter, the other from my niece) even had scratches on it. However, it fits everything that my daughter has, could be bigger or more compartments for the clothes/accessories since as any Barbie fan knows, you can have a ton of it. My daughter has been using her Barbie rolling bin non stop since I got it. I am hoping it lasts at least a few years, crossing my fingers. Lis 
THANK YOU THANK YOU! This was the best! It fits all of my daughters barbie's and there is even a place for shoes, etc! I Love this bin!! 
My son loves pokemon but it is so hard to find anything but cards at the local retail stores. I had a hard time even online finding anything but cards and a few stuffed animals. I was so happy to find this set. My son loved the ash figure. He has had many hours of pretend play with these figures. This is a must buy for pokemon fans 
I played this game with a few friends and we had a great time. It is really fun trying to figure out which face you think your friends are going to go for. I had such a good time that another friend and I decided the buy the game for ourselves 
I finally learned how to crochet with the Alex Granny Squares Kit...I practiced for two nights...directions and illustrations were easy to follow even for a lefty like me...with this kit I completed a hat and scarf for my grand-niece for Christmas...even had enough scraps left over to make five hackysacks for the rest of my nieces and nephews for Christmas. What's really great now that I have learned some of the basics is that I can move on to other crochet projects 
As a parent of profoundly autistic twin boys, this train set is great for their imagination skills. Also it's well constructed and takes a beating (literally). They have a special tote for it and pull it out daily. It's a classic wooden set without all the bells and whistles, gadgets and annoying sounds. Their unsteady little hands can easily put the train together (because it's magnetized) and onto the tracks. A great buy! 
A nice wooden train set that fits with brio brand or other brands of wooden train sets. Not the same quality as brio, but still very nice. Sturdy with plenty of pieces for kids. Good value 
My daughter got this set for her birthday (which is in a few days) from her Uncle. I let her open it early so we can stretch out her birthday into a week full of celebrations! She loves this set. She was able to do most of this on her own BUT there were several parts that she needed help with. The instruction book that came with it is excellent and really helped her "see" what she needed to do next. We completed all the little houses and are halfway through Spongbob's house. Had to stop for bedtime, I am such a mean Mom I know! She can't wait to get the Krusty Krab set as well. This was our first venture into the "little" Legos and it went much smoother than I anticipated when I opened the box and saw all the tiny parts! We are storing the extra pieces in zip lock bags until we need them, so keep them from getting lost. 
This was a great hit with my son. He enjoyed both assembling the kit and using it as a play set. The pieces are on the small side so it would definitely need parental help for a kid on the younger side of the suggested age range. 
My boys love it! (ages 6 and 8) Haven't been able to find it at Toys R Us or anywhere else for that matter. They can't wait to get more Sponge Bob legos 
I found this LEGO set to be incredibly easy to put together if following the directions closely. My son is only 5 (just turned), so helped where he could--but there are some insanely small pieces in this set! I recommend dumping the bags of pieces in a large mixing bowl, then rummaging for what you need as you assemble... We had a close call with the heating vent, so switched to the mixing bowl method of LEGO management. Now that we are done with assembly, which was great fun and high quality togetherness, my son is on cloud 9 with his Bikini Bottom set! He's played with it for hours at the kitchen table, with no waning interest in sight. We made a pretend newspaper for Gary to sleep on, and now my little guy acts out all sorts of SB scenarios. SB's bed is so cool, the jellyfish aquarium, the basketball hoop, Patrick's rock... There are so many neat little features. Patrick has a swivel TV! The only two things that slightly annoy me are 1) the eyebrow on Squidward's tiki house falls off easily (no big deal), and 2)SB's bedpost falls apart easily (also no big). The finished houses are smaller than I expected, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment at all. PLEASE check the Lego website for the suggested retail price and decide what you want to pay. The price quoted by Amazon's third party vendor is astronomical--I got mine at Toys R Us and paid MSRP--MUCH less than Amazon's current price. I find it worth every penny and am having a blast listening to my son changing his voice for all the characters and monotoning "70 hours later..." in the voice-over guy's deadpan. This has been, so far, our favorite Christmas gift. In a few days we'll put together Buildabob, and I'm definitely going to buy the Krusty Krab set 
This product is great for any SpongeBob lover. My 7 year old plays with it forever. It's great that he can "throw" jelly fish from Patrick's house to SpongeBob's. [... 
This is a very expensive set. Personally I didn't think it was worth it. Very hard to follow instructions with very small, easy to lose pieces. Way too difficult for small children to put together. Once together it was fun too play with but still not worth the money 
My daughter has had hours of fun putting this set together and mixing pieces with the Krusty Krab set I bought for he. She saved her own money to buy this and it's been one of those toys that she really likes to play with over and over. This set is great for a child's imagination. She is eight and I think it was worth the money. 
After reading the reviews by other parents stating that this Lego set is "too much for a 7 year old" - well, I had to write something. This is an excellent and very interactive set. The age range is 7-12, so that does not mean you can drop it in the lap of your 7 year old and miracles will happen! This set needs adult help for younger kids, while my older kid put it together in minutes! It has great features which make it more than just building, you play catapult-like games with the highly creative toys you just built - a bed that throws SpongeBob out of it, 2 catapults for firing play jellyfish, and of course, a car and interactive basketball hoop inside SpongeBob's house. Note to parents for kids 7-8, you may ACTUALLY need to get down on the ground and play with your kids! Surprise! Older kids can build this fairly easily and seem to invent a lot of games to play with their brothers/sisters. I give this set 5 stars because it combines the challenge of buliding with legos, but has more small creative gizmos to play with once the set is built. And as a last comment to people who complain that legos fall apart and need to be reassembled... duh! If you like to play with your 7-9 year old and don't want to use legos as a babysitter, this is the top lego set available for the price! For older kids, they will get a tremendous amount of enjoyment (provided they like SpongeBob) 
As a teacher and avid buyer of educational toys I have to say this is one of the most versital, well designed, durable toys I have seen 
I would highly recommend this toy for all preschoolers. It is a useful tool for kids 3+ and up. My daughter plays with this toy for hours. It helps her with her alphabets and numbers. It also helps her identify different animals. 
I think this book is very good for learning the skills of third grade. The only thing is that I wish it came with a case to hold the cartridge, book and pen in one place like my sister's Smart guide to 1st grade came with 
I'm a little disappointed about the Smart Guide to Third Grade, not because it's not good, but because it doesn't offer much more than the sample book that came with the Quantum Pad. I'm sure that someone who has the LeapPad will get more use out of it, but if I had known that the only major bonuses are in the math section, I would have purchased the Third Grade Math Book instead 
I didnt know that leap pad had a quauntum series. We just happened to see this title in the store and I couldnt believe it. The fact it works with the old leap pad system is a huge plus. My daughter is 8 and will be going to third grade next year. She played with this book all day when she got it. She especially loves the multiplication page and I like the write and erase pages. It really helps kids learn 
This is one of the best leap pad books made. I am currently looking for more "Smart Guide" books for different grades. What I love about it is the variety of subjects offered. It teaches math, reading, social studies and more!! I can't say enough positive remarks about it 
Yahtzee is the funnest family game out there. It is so quick to pull out and fast to learn. You really only need 5 dice and you're ready to play Yahtzee. I found this website: [...]/ which will count the score on all the dice for you. It's like an online yahtzee scoresheet/scorecard. Try it out if you buy the game! 
as a child and it is still as fun.. just never have anyone to play it with LO 
This is an oldie but goodie. I had this game from childhood but in a flood I lost it. Year's later thinking about all the fun I had with it I bought it again. I'm glad I did. It's just as fun as it ever was and even more so now that I don't get upset if I don't always win. The cat also likes the Dice. It's an inexpensive game fun for the whole family that will bring back happy memories and make new ones 
AWESOME! Just introduced this game to my 10 yr old son and he loved it! would recommend this to everyone 
Great value good family fun. Game that the whole family can enjoy together all ages from 2-10 
I really like this game for its entertainment valus as well as being a little educational in the logical thought and strategy areas. I found lost more info about it at http://www.yahtzee.org.u 
This is one of my favourite games and makes a great solitaire game. It can get frustrating at some times. Most of the skill lies in the scoring but there are alot of times where you have to make sacrifices. I recommend you get the folio travle version thing, because it is so much more attractive, great for travelling and doesn't create that much noise. It is also makes a great solitaire game 
I have been playing Yahtzee since I was 6, and I get as much enjoyment out of it now at age 37 as I did over 30 years ago. If you've never played the game, you are in for a treat. Players role 5 dice and try to rack up points by rolling the most 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's, straights, full house, etc. And if you get 5 of one kind? Yahtzee! A big score! Strategy plays a big role in this game, and it can easily be said that half the games I lose, I do so because of my mistakes. Yahtzee is a true family classic 
I played Yahtzee as a kid with my Dad and had forgotten how much fun it was. While looking for some non-electronic games to play with my kids, I stumbled across Yahtzee and instantly remembered the good times. Introducing the game to the family tonight, I was hoping that they would enjoy it as much as I had years ago. They did not dissapoint me and after playing several games they all complimented me on the choice. Another reviewer called Yahtzee "quietly educational", and I completely agree with that term. My oldest, who since his school started letting him use a calculator in algebra and geometry has lost the ability to do math in his head, suddenly rediscovered his math skills when his score was on the line. The only thing Milton Bradley did wrong with this game was being cheap on the size of the pad of score sheets they include. Other than that, this is a classic game that has not lost anything over the years. Turn off the television or computer and play this game with people you love. 
I ordered three of these CD players for our Sunday School classes so we could play the CDs that are part of the curriculum. The players work very well and their portability is a real plus. The only negative I've noticed is the limited amount of volume they have when played without an ear piece 
Grandson loved the John Deere toolbelt, shipped fast in time for Christmas, no problem 
We were a little disappointed about the size of this skateboard. Pay attention to the dimensions - its really a little kids skateboard - too small for the 12 and 13 year olds we were buying them for 
I love it. It's cute and you can't find it in any store on the west coast so therefore it's special. I bought it for my son's thrid birthday gift(one of many cars items he received) and he seems to love it 
I would have given tehm 5 stars but Chery Dakota are not as articulated as I would want to see,But are still great figures. But the Tarantino Figuer is ouite articulated 
What a neat kit!!! I am a mother of a six year old who loves arts and crafts and experiments....I am somewhat lazy when it comes to things where my daughter and I need to work together on anything complicated or that takes a long time. this is so easy and it's really interesting too. Also there is not really any mess!!! I highly recommend this kit!!! 
Basically the whole kit is build around some powder which absorbs water and grows like a gel. It's obviosly safe, fun and not messy. My 5 year old daughter loves it. I do recommend 
A great price for educational experiments. My 6 yr-old and 4 yr-old both enjoyed making snow and playing with gooey polymers. I was amazed as well, especially by the easy-to-understand instructions and interesting science facts 
this toy helped me on my science project i won it showed me how snow is formed and every thin 
Just picked this up yesterday on clearance at Target for, get this, $6.97!!!!!!!!!!!!
